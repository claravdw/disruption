You have a choice \u2014 kill or get killed.\u2019\\nAs well as suggesting these \u2018social justice warriors\u2019 spend time living under the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, the journalist went on to suggest those who defaced the Winston Churchill in Parliament Square during the Black Lives Matter demonstrations should be \u2018shipped off to North Korea\u2019 to do the same there and face the consequences, as well as pitching for an episode of this series to feature Extinction Rebellion protestors glueing themselves to a major road in Beijing and seeing how the Beijing authorities deals with the \u2018numpties paralysing commuter traffic\u2019.\\nJane, who\u2019s yet to publicly address the criticism, wrote: \u2018The road would be peppered with skin patches as they were literally torn from the scene and carted off to the nearest prison for a morning of torture followed by an afternoon programme of forced labour.\u2019\\nMany on social media were outraged at Jane\u2019s suggestion any of the Gen Z lot who didn\u2019t find the current situation in the UK, amid the rising cost of living off the back of nearly two years in a crippling pandemic, should take up arms and head to the Russian border, with her name trending on Twitter on Wednesday afternoon.\\nAuthor James Felton wrote: \u2018Just someone whose closest experience to war is hosting ITV lunchtime chat show Loose Women fantasising about kids who have known nothing but two recessions and pandemic being forced to fight a superpower.\u2019\\nWriter Caspar Salmon shared the column, writing on Twitter: \u2018Jane Moore has two daughters of an age to join the army, so I hope she will be encouraging them to volunteer.\u2019\\nWolverhampton councillor Chris Burden added: \u2018Jane Moore was born in the 60s.\\n\u2018Jane Moore has not been to war.\\n\u2018Jane Moore seems to be pretending that she\u2019s seen the horrors of conflict to dunk on kids who she thinks should inexplicably be sent to the trenches.\\n\u2018Jane Moore is wrong.\u2019\\nOthers took the mick, joking the presenter \u2018famously fought in the trenches of World War One,\u2019 as another chimed in: \u2018Jane Moore is right. Young \u2018uns have no idea of the bitter struggles our generation faced: free education, student grants, well-paid jobs with final salary pensions, union representation and affordable housing.\u2019\\nJane isn\u2019t the only media personality who\u2019s copped it on social media after sharing her views on the younger generation, with Kirstie Allsopp recently the centre of swift backlash after she suggested young people could easily buy a home if they gave up luxuries like \u2018easyJet, coffee, gym [and] Netflix\u2019.\\nMetro.co.uk contacted Jane\u2019s reps for comment.\\nMORE : Alison Hammond still the queen of iconic TV moments she\u2019s left flustered after accidentally flipping off Janet Jackson\\nMORE : Amanda Holden looks unreal in stunning pictures as she turns 51\\nGot a story?\\nIf you\u2019ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page \u2013 we\u2019d love to hear from you.", "image": [["Jane has riled up the masses with her thoughts on \u2018social justice warriors\u2019 (Picture: ITV)", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SEI_87235451-e1645027823901.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=644%2C407"], ["The Loose Women star suggested people swap with Ukrainian Army soldiers (Picture: AP)", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/client-mu-plugins/metro-branding/images/fallback.png"], ["The Churchill statue was defaced in 2020 (Picture: ISABEL INFANTES/AFP via Getty Images)", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/client-mu-plugins/metro-branding/images/fallback.png"]], "author": ["Mel Evans"], "date": "2022-02-16"}}
