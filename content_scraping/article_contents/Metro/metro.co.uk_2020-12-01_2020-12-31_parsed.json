The Government also plans to reach net zero emissions by 2050.\\nDefra said the project will help reduce flood risk, boost biodiversity and increase people\u2019s access to woodland and green space, but campaigners may feel the plan does not go far enough.\\nIt is also hoped the scheme will increase jobs within the forestry and environmental sector.\\nAmong those due to receive funding are The Forest of Marston Vale, Bedfordshire, the Greenwood Community Forest, west Nottinghamshire, and the City of Trees in Greater Manchester.\\nAlso included are the Mersey Forest, the Forest of Avon, the Forest of Mercia, two projects in Yorkshire and two in the south-east.\\nThe cash will come from the Government\u2019s \u00a3640 million Nature for Climate Fund, which was announced in March.\\nForestry Minister Lord Goldsmith said: \u2018Through this exciting new programme we will build back greener, as more communities \u2013 particularly those in urban environments \u2013 will have access to nature, with real benefits for health and wellbeing.\\n\u2018Trees are the backbone of our urban and rural environments, and essential in tackling the climate emergency.\\n\u2018This vital programme will plant trees where they are most needed to stem flooding and provide more places for nature to thrive.\u2019\\nSir William Worsley, chair of the Forestry Commission, added: \u2018The \u00a312.1 million boost will be a huge help both for getting trees in the ground, but also enabling each of the community forests to ensure they are well-managed in the long term, making sure these new woods can thrive to the fullest extent.\u2019\\nTo mark national tree week, which ends today, Friends of the Earth produced a map showing the areas where potential woodlands could be created across England \u2013 and said it was possible to double current woodland coverage of the country, which is around 10%.\\nIn Northumberland alone, the environment group said there was potential for 77,000 hectares of new woodland.\\nDanny Gross, tree campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u2018We\u2019re calling on Forestry Minister Zac Goldsmith to mark National Tree Week by setting an ambitious target to boost tree cover in England.\\n\u2018Growing more trees would help us fight climate breakdown while enabling more people to access nature in their local area. We need more councils to step up and grow more trees, but it\u2019s time that ministers in Westminster offer more funding for climate action at a local level.\u2019\\nThe Trees for Climate scheme comes on the back of \u00a33.9 million of funding announced on Saturday to help increase tree cover in urban and rural settings across the UK, as well as close to waterways to reduce flood risk.\\nMore than half the funding, \u00a32.5 million, will be spent on five pilot schemes over the next two-and-a-half years, to develop tree planting programmes in different communities.\\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.\\nFor more stories like this, check our news page.\\nMORE : Ed Miliband backs Extinction Rebellion mass tree planting plan\\nPrivacy Policy", "image": [["500 hectares of trees are set to be planted from Yorkshire to Somerset (Picture: Getty Images)", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1183941728-c745.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=644%2C429"], ["The Government hopes to see 30,000 hectares of woodland planted each year by 2025 (Picture: Getty Images)", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/client-mu-plugins/metro-branding/images/fallback.png"]], "author": ["Harrison Jones"], "date": "2020-12-06"}}
