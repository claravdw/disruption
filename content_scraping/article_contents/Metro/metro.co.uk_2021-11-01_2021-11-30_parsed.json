\u2018protect the Earth\u2019", "subtitle": null, "text": "Mars says its will produce one of the first \u2018carbon neutral\u2019 chocolate bars to appear on UK shelves by 2023.\\nThe company is also promising to slash its carbon footprint by more than 20% within 14 months, in an announcement timed to coincide with the crucial Cop26 climate summit.\\nBut experts and environmental groups questioned the confectionary giant\u2019s claim, branding the updated Mars bar a \u2018sugar-coated gimmick\u2019.\\nThe company says Mars bars sold in the UK, Ireland and Canada will be certified as carbon neutral by January 1, 2023, adding that it will work with an independent auditor and use the PAS 2060 standard for carbon neutrality.\\nMars bars, more than 200 million of which are sold in the UK alone, will also be trialled in fully recyclable paper packaging next year \u2013 while the company says it will reach net zero emissions \u2018across its full value chain\u2019 by 2050.\\nYet Greenpeace and the food and environment NGO Feedback ridiculed the claim and urged the company to do more to reduce deforestation and emissions, particularly in its supply chain.\\nDairy and cocoa are key contributors to greenhouse gases and deforestation, while experts say \u2018carbon offsetting\u2019 should not be used as an excuse to continue damaging environmental practices.\\nThe company said it would be making 20% reductions in emissions, with 80% in offsetting.\\nGreenpeace forests campaigner Diana Ruiz told Metro.co.uk: \u2018Mars\u2019 so called carbon neutral chocolate bars are yet another sugar-coated gimmick.\u2019\\nShe added: \u2018The food conglomerate\u2019s business model remains tied to massive land-use and agricultural emissions.\\n\u2018After more than a decade Mars has yet to put an end to deforestation tied to its supply chains and its net zero pledge does not translate to the necessary actions that are needed now.\u2019\\nBut the company is promising to \u2018supercharge\u2019 its efforts to sustainably transform supply chain practices, including by accelerating partnerships with suppliers to produce dairy more sustainably and through using satellite data to geomap cocoa farms.\\nMars says it has an ambition of a \u2018deforestation-free supply chain for cocoa\u2019, and its satellite data has already mapped over a third in its supply chain, in an effort to better monitor and manage its suppliers..\\nIt said any emissions that it cannot eliminate will be \u2018offset by high-quality carbon removal credits\u2019, including reforestation and land restoration.\\nThe plan to make a carbon neutral bar within 14 months is forecast to be roughly equivalent to charging more than 13 billion smartphones, according to company calculations.\\nAdam Grant, Mars Wrigley UK\u2019s general manager, explained: \u201cAt Mars, we believe that actions speak louder than words and, to create a world tomorrow where our planet is healthy, we are clear that bold action must be taken today.\\nOur pledge to deliver a certified carbon neutral Mars bar\u2026 supported by significant reductions in the near term, is the kind of immediate climate protection intervention needed to deliver a sustainable tomorrow.\u2019\\nMars also pointed out that the factory it produces its bar in sources 100% renewable electricity.\\nYet that is not enough for Feedback, whose head of policy, Jessica Sinclair-Taylor, told Metro.co.uk: \u2018The appeal of a guilt-free Mars bar is easy to understand, but like many corporate climate commitments this pledge lacks sufficient detail to reassure customers that Mars can deliver on its environmental promises.\\n\u2018Mars\u2019 wider climate targets acknowledge that the company\u2019s carbon footprint is bigger than that of some countries, with the lion\u2019s share of these emissions coming from agriculture and deforestation. \u2018Fixing these supply chain problems means getting serious about reducing emissions from emissions-intensive products like dairy, by setting targets to reduce how much dairy they use in their supply chain.\u2019\\nShe added: \u2018Only reducing carbon emissions from producing their Mars bars\u00a0by 20%, and reaching for offsets to deal with the remaining 80% emissions,\u00a0simply isn\u2019t ambitious enough: offsets are too often being used as a \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card for climate problems companies just don\u2019t want to deal with, with no guarantees that emissions reductions will occur long-term.\u2019\\nFor more stories like

At this COP, the final decision must commit to phase out fossil fuels, which means reducing demand for those fuels from high-carbon industries like aviation.\\n\u2018Policy-makers and countries should ban short-haul flights wherever a viable alternative already exists, and invest in rail to create a transport system that\u2019s good for the planet while also being affordable and accessible to all.\u2019\\nClarence House has previously defended Prince Charles\u2019s use of a private jet for the G20 summit in Italy, from where he flew into Glasgow.\\nA spokesman said: \u2018His Royal Highness has personally campaigned for a shift towards Sustainable Aviation Fuel and would only undertake travel to Rome when it was agreed that sustainable fuel would be used in the plane.\u2019\\nA COP26 spokesperson told Metro.co.uk: \u2018All delegates have been encouraged to consider low-carbon travel options to attend COP26.\\n\u2018The UK will be offsetting carbon emissions associated with running the event, including international travel.\u2019\\nDo you have a story you would like to share?
