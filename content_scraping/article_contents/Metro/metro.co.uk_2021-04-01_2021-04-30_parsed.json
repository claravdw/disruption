law\u2019", "subtitle": null, "text": "Six Extinction Rebellion protesters have been cleared of causing criminal damage to Shell\u2019s London headquarters despite the judge directing jurors they had no defence in law.\\nTwo of the group\u2019s co-founders Simon Bramwell, 49, and Ian Bray, 53, were acquitted on Friday alongside Jane Augsburger, 55, Senan Clifford, 60, David Lambert, 62, and James \u2018Sid\u2019 Saunders, 41, after a trial at Southwark Crown Court.\\nThe six, who represented themselves, were also cleared of individual counts of having an article with intent to destroy or damage property, while a seventh protester, Katerina Hasapopoulous, 43, earlier pleaded guilty to criminal damage.\\nProsecutor Diana Wilson told jurors each of the defendants deliberately sprayed graffiti or smashed windows at the Shell building in Belvedere Road, central London, on April 15, 2019.\\nThe protest, which saw activists pour fake oil, glue themselves to windows and doors, break glass, climb onto a roof and spray graffiti, was part of wider Extinction Rebellion demonstrations across the capital.\\nMs Wilson said that while some protesters stood outside the building holding banners or speaking through megaphones, \u2018these defendants went further\u2019, adding: \u2018The seven involved caused significant damage.\u2019\\nAll those who stood trial explained they had targeted the Shell building because the oil giant was directly contributing to climate change, thereby causing serious injury and death, and argued it was a \u2018necessary\u2019 and \u2018proportionate\u2019 response to the harm being caused.\\nClifford quoted Sir David Attenborough and former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams in his evidence.\\nHe said: \u2018I believe if I don\u2019t do whatever I can to protect our Earth, to protect life on this Earth, to stop the death and injury that is and will be happening, I\u2019m committing a crime, a really serious crime, and I\u2019m willing to break a window, to paint a message on a wall, I\u2019m willing to break the glass on that emergency button, even if some say that\u2019s a crime.\\n\u2018Because this is a much bigger crime and I\u2019m trying to stop that crime, I\u2019m trying to protect life in the only way I feel I can.\u2019\\nJudge Gregory Perrins directed jurors that even if they thought the protesters were \u2018morally justified\u2019 it did not provide them with a lawful excuse to commit criminal damage.\\nTo get the latest news from the capital visit Metro.co.uk's London news hub.\\nWith the exception of Saunders, who claimed in his defence that he honestly believed Shell\u2019s employees and shareholders would have consented to his criminal damage, the judge said: \u2018They don\u2019t have any defence in law for the charges they face.\u2019\\nBut the jury of seven women and five men took seven hours and four minutes to acquit them of both charges.\\nSome of the defendants waved at jurors, several of whom were visibly emotional, as they left court.\\nBefore reaching their verdicts, the jury had asked to see a copy of the oath they took when they were sworn in.\\nThanking jurors for their \u2018care and attention\u2019, the judge said: \u2018This has been an unusual case.\u2019\\nAugsburger, Bramwell, Clifford, Lambert and Saunders, who are all from Stroud, Gloucestershire and Bray, from Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, were jubilant as they left court.\\nHasapopoulous, from Stroud, will be sentenced later.\\nSpeaking after the verdicts, Bramwell said Hasapopoulous had only pleaded guilty because of child care issues.\\nHe said: \u2018This is such a significant victory for the consciousness of the British people when it comes to the huge, immediate threat of climate change and the absolute failure of our Government to do anything meaningful about it.\u2019\\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us

people.\\nRiot police were sent to Westminster as a stand-off ensued.

However, organisers must carry out risk assessments and take steps to keep people safe.\\nIn a later statement, the Met said: \u2018At this stage, 26 people have been arrested for a variety of offences including assault on police and breach of the peace. In one instance, a woman was arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon after a knife was recovered.\\n\u2018The policing operation remains ongoing and this arrest total is likely to rise. Ten officers received injuries during the operation; none of these are believed to be serious.\u2019\\nCommander Ade Adelekan, who led today\u2019s policing operation, added: \u2018The vast majority of people who turned out in central London today did so while adhering to social distancing.
