But, among a ton of interesting storylines \u2013 not least a dip in fortunes for championship leader Max Verstappen and a popular return to the podium for home hero Lewis Hamilton \u2013 all memories will be fixed on Zhou Guanyu\u2019s horror crash.\\nIt took 53 minutes for the race to be restarted after he, George Russell and Alexander Albon had their races ended before the first turn. The No.24 Alfa Romeo was clipped by Russell, and sent flying down the track upside down before it flipped over the top of the tyre barrier.\\nThe roll hoop was destroyed but the Halo cockpit protection did its job. It is the fourth time the device, introduced in 2018, has saved an F1 driver from serious injury.\\nConfirmation that the Chinese driver was okay came late, with many viewers left to fear the worst. His return to the paddock before the race was over, dressed in team kit and casually letting everyone know he was fine, was almost unfathomable.\\nSunday was the first time his Shanghai-based parents have attended a grand prix to see their 23-year-old son at work. It must have been a whirlwind of emotions for them. While Zhou was released after a brief check-up at the circuit medical centre, Albon was helicoptered to Coventry Hospital before being given the all-clear. In the melee, the Williams driver had been clouted by Sebastian Vettel, hit the pitwall hard and rebounded into the paths of Esteban Ocon and Yuki Tsunoda.\\nThe accident was not the only issue officials had to deal with on lap one.\\nSeven protesters from activist group Just Stop Oil broke into the circuit and sat down on the Wellington Straight. By the time the cars reached it, the red flags were already out.\\nThe protesters were not shown on TV and were subsequently arrested. Northamptonshire Police had been tipped off the group were planning a track invasion, but they still managed to get through security. The force described the move as an \u2018incredibly dangerous decision,\u2019 which obviously put the lives of the drivers at risk as well as their own.\\nMcLaren\u2019s Lando Norris said after the race: \u2018If you\u2019ve really got to be that silly to go on to a race track with Formula 1 cars\u2026 It\u2019s a scary thing. You\u2019re putting us at risk to be involved in something that we would never ever want to be involved in.\u2019\\nVettel, who is increasingly vocal about climate change, was more sympathetic. \u2018I think these people don\u2019t act out of frustration, but they are desperate, and I very much sympathise with their fears and anxieties which I think everybody who understands the size of the problem that\u2019s drifting towards us can understand,\u2019 he said.\\nYesterday, the protest group\u2019s spokesman James Skeet was interviewed on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, so their efforts were rewarded with TV exposure in the end. It might have been worth putting it to Mr Skeet that the sport is introducing synthetic fuel in 2026 and is at the forefront of road-relevant hybrid technologies.\\nAs Lewis Hamilton says: \u2018People have the opportunity to speak out. I just don\u2019t believe jumping into a Formula 1 track is the best way to do it. I think F1 is doing a great job already to go carbon neutral by 2030.\u2019\\nShort of a British winner, Silverstone\u2019s capacity crowd couldn\u2019t have been happier for Sainz to win his first race after 150 starts. Doing so from pole position will do his confidence the world of good, and I\u2019m sure more victories are on the horizon.\\nBut it presents a problem for Ferrari. Sainz defied orders to win the race. Ferrari wanted Charles Leclerc to lead. The team did not help matters by keeping Leclerc out on old tyres during a late-race safety car.\\nBut he somehow managed to fight the cars with fresher rubber behind him \u2013 passing Hamilton around the outside of Copse no less. In the end, he had to concede the remaining two podium positions to Sergio Perez and the man who got the biggest cheers from the grandstands, Hamilton.\\nHamilton aims cheeky dig at Verstappen after Leclerc duel at British Grand Prix\\n\u2018I\u2019m ok!\u2019 \u2013 Zhou Guanyu reacts after heavy crash at British Grand Prix\\nFor more stories like this,\u00a0check our sport page.\\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on \nFacebook,\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\\n", "image": [["Zhou Guanyu\u2019s crash was one of the most terrifying Formula 1 has seen in recent years.
