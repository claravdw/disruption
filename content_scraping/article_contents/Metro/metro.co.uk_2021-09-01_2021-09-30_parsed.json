Besides, Jack is \u2018very aware\u2019 of the irony of flying across the globe to talk about climate change.\\nInstead, local crews in places such as Thailand, India and Morocco have shot their segments remotely and sent them back to Jack and his team to weave into each episode, ensuring the voices of those suffering the most will be heard by those with the power to do something about it.\\n\u2018It\u2019s called Seat At The Table because these conferences happen every year but the people who are experiencing the effects of the climate crisis first hand don\u2019t have a say, so we really wanted to platform those voices,\u2019 he says.\\nBefore we sit down to chat, Jack gets recognised on the streets of King\u2019s Cross by students from Central Saint Martins \u2014 a reminder that he only got to this point thanks to a YouTube channel that has amassed 3.75million subscribers.\\nGo back and watch Jack\u2019s earliest videos, uploaded in 2011 when he was just 18, and it\u2019s fairly standard YouTube stuff: quirky video diaries, strumming a ukulele and falling off a unicycle.\\n\u2018I had no particular desire to talk about social issues, I was just a kid d***ing around in my bedroom,\u2019 he says. \u2018But after three or four years of developing an audience, there\u2019s a moment where you sit down and you\u2019re like: do I have more of a responsibility to be talking about something that has an impact?\u2019\\nIn 2015, the WWF invited Jack to visit Greenland and see for himself how the melting glaciers were causing sea levels to rise.\\n\u2018We felt it, we heard it, we saw it,\u2019 he says. \u2018That just kind of turned my world upside down.\u2019\\nAfter taking some time out to study documentary film-making, read IPCC reports and subscribe to every environmental newsletter he could find, Jack returned to YouTube with a more singular focus: to share what he\u2019d learnt about the issues \u2018in the hope that together we can all figure out what the hell to do\u2019.\\nFour years later he was arrested at an Extinction Rebellion protest in London. While he says his days of glueing himself to things are probably behind him, he credits XR, Greta Thunberg and the school strikes for a \u2018collective awakening\u2019 on the urgency of the climate crisis.\\n\u2018It feels like the fire alarm is going off and what we need to do now is start to point people towards the exits,\u2019 he says. \u2018We need to figure out where we\u2019re going.\u2019\\nAnd that\u2019s what makes COP26 so important. When Jack interviewed David Attenborough, the naturalist called the conference, which begins on October 31, \u2018our last best chance to avoid the worst-case scenario\u2019. Jack echoes that sentiment.\\n\u2018There\u2019s a group in the United States called the Sunrise Movement, which I\u2019m really inspired by. They\u2019re collectively organising to campaign for the Green New Deal in the USA.\\n\u2018I also admire a young activist called Jerome Foster in the United States, and a girl called Leah Thomas who runs a platform called Intersectional Environmentalist \u2014 she does a lot of work around highlighting intersectionalities of climate and race and many other social issues.\\nLeah Thomas uses her platform to highlight how social and climate issues affect each other\\n\u2018Social media has transformed over the past year and a half. It\u2019s become more of a space for activism, organising and educating.\\n\u2018 That gives me hope because I think our generation faces a greater challenge than any before \u2014 but we also have more tools than ever before to tackle it.\u2019\\n\u2018It\u2019s the most important event that\u2019s ever happened when it comes to climate and the future of humanity,\u2019 he says. \u2018That sounds so grand and ridiculous but it really is. We\u2019ve entered this crucial decade where we have to halve carbon emissions so it\u2019s essential we put pressure on world leaders to make those tough policy changes because we just don\u2019t have the luxury of time any more. Yes, we all need to make individual changes, but we can only exist within the system that is around us.\u2019\\nJack lets out a long sigh when I ask him how much faith he has in the UK government to treat these issues with the urgency needed.\\n\u2018I don\u2019t see any sort of leadership there when it comes to the climate crisis,\u2019 he says. \u2018I have some hope in Sadiq Khan and some of the things he\u2019s been doing around air pollution. It\u2019s a relief to have someone in the political sphere waking up.\u2019\\nLack of faith is something Jack admits he\u2019s struggled with but he looks at how people mobilised against Covid and hopes that action can be summoned against an ecological emergency. As a \u2018green influencer\u2019, does he need to be optimistic?\\n\u2018I hate that word so much,\u2019 says Jack. \u2018It just carries so much weight, doesn\u2019t it? When I started making YouTube videos there was no such thing as an influencer, nobody made money doing it. I don\u2019t think of myself as someone who is influential in any way.\u2019\\nA combined YouTube, Twitter, Instagram and Facebook following of more than 7.5 million would suggest Jack holds more sway than he\u2019s giving himself credit for \u2014 if his contribution to COP26 has the desired effect, it would be hard to call him anything else.\\nHarries\u2019 YouTube Originals series Seat At The Table premieres on October 25 on youtube.com/JacksGap\\nMORE : Climate change is impacting more white people in the West \u2013 does that mean leaders will take action?\\nMORE : Where is this Government\u2019s action on climate change?\\nPrivacy Policy", "image": [["The activist is making a YouTube documentary to highlight effects of climate change (Picture: Daniel Lynch)", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PRI_196593639.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=644%2C429"], ["Jack felt he had a responsibility to talk about something that has an impact in his YouTube videos (Picture: Daniel Lynch)", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/client-mu-plugins/metro-branding/images/fallback.png"], ["Protests like the Global Climate Strike are helping people become aware of the climate emergency (Picture: In Pictures via Getty Images)", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/client-mu-plugins/metro-branding/images/fallback.png"], ["Leah Thomas uses her platform to highlight how social and climate issues affect each other", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/client-mu-plugins/metro-branding/images/fallback.png"]], "author": ["Tom Wiggins"], "date": "2021-09-20"}, "https://metro.co.uk/2021/09/23/this-morning-guest-appears-naked-in-fight-against-climate-change-15304398/": {"title": "This Morning viewers flummoxed as activist appears naked in fight against climate change: \u2018Is her bare bottom on that sofa?\u2019", "subtitle": null, "text": "Sorry, this video isn't available any more.\\nThis Morning viewers were left astonished when a guest appeared on the programme to raise awareness of climate change in a unique way, sitting naked on the sofa in the studio.\\nLaura Amherst, a protester for Extinction Rebellion, was invited onto Thursday\u2019s edition of This Morning to speak to Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby about why she uses her bold method to bring attention to her cause.\\nThe banner on the TV screen about Laura stated: \u2018I protest topless to help save the planet,\u2019 as the activist told Phillip and Holly that in an ideal world, people would listen to what she had to say about climate change straight away, and so she wouldn\u2019t need to go to extreme lengths to get their attention.\\nLaura was asked for her views on environmental group Insulate Britain, who have sparked controversy after shutting down the M25 several times, causing major disruption and \u2018endangering people\u2019s lives\u2019, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said.\\nSaying that she wished to stay \u2018neutral\u2019 on Insulate Britain, Laura stressed that Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain are two separate organisations, adding that while Insulate Britain are promoting an important message about damage to the environment, they \u2018should be held responsible for their actions\u2019.\\nWhile Phillip and Holly questioned Laura about her activism, some viewers watching the show expressed their shock over Laura making an appearance stark naked, with several questioning if there was any sort of blanket or cover on the couch.\\n\u2018Is she fully naked I hope they dettol the sofa afterwards,\u2019 one person tweeted, while another asked: \u2018#ThisMorning is her bare bottom on that sofa?\u2019\\n\u2018Sorry but\u2026is her hooha just nakedly sat on that couch?
