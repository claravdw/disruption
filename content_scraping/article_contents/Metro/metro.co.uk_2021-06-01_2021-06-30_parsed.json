appeared to be dressed as catering staff, glued themselves to a banner, reading: \u2018Racing to Extinction.\u2019\\nThey staged the demonstration while the Queen\u2019s horses Tactical and Light Refrain were stationary at the start line ready with the others to race in the Jersey Stakes.\\nActivists say they wanted to send a message to the monarch in a bid to get her to \u2018use her influence to tackle the climate and ecological emergency\u2019.\\nPictures show security lifting the protesters up and taking them off the Berkshire racecourse.\\nExtinction Rebellion say the protest was a tribute to suffragette, Emily Davison, who died attempting to attach a flag to the King\u2019s horse during the Epsom Derby in 1913.\\nCampaigners crossed the track 15 minutes before the race to make sure there was enough time for the alarm to be raised in order to prevent anyone getting hurt.\\nProtester Sam Smithson, 38, said: \u2018I\u2019m really sorry to be disrupting this event, but unfortunately, like suffragette Emily Davison, we have been left with no other choice, as we are running out of time in the race to tackle the climate and ecological emergency.\\n\u2018We can\u2019t negotiate with each other or nature for more time by carbon offsetting, whilst also promoting infinite growth on a finite planet and chopping down our ancient woodlands.\u2019\\nThe environmentalist group had previously sent the Queen an open letter, requesting her to make an emergency speech to Parliament \u2018urging them to tell the truth and act now on the climate and ecological emergency\u2019.\\nActivists also requested she hold face-to-face talks with Boris Johnson and tell him to respond proportionately to the issue.\\nThey also asked her to urge parliament to reconsider the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which if passed would give police greater powers to restrict peaceful protests.\\nAnother of the protesters, Sally Davidson, 33, said: \u2018The Queen has a unique position in the Commonwealth and direct access to the government and Prime Minister.\\n\u2018She can encourage them to take action on the climate and ecological emergency, rather than just pay lip service to it.\\n\u2018Two years ago, Parliament declared a climate emergency and in 2015 they signed the Paris Agreement.\\n\u2018Despite this, during the pandemic alone, they have invested more in fossil fuels than previous years.\u2019\\nThe Queen arrived for the final day of Royal Ascot this afternoon, having missed the rest of this week\u2019s races.\\nShe is well known for

null, "text": "The UK isn\u2019t doing enough to tackle global warming and meet its requirements to curb carbon emissions.\\nThat\u2019s the gist of two environmental reports published today by the advisory\u00a0Climate\u00a0Change Committee.\\nThe reports urge the government to go further with actions to stop emissions.\\nNot doing so will risk undermining Britain\u2019s position at the forthcoming Cop26 environmental summit in November.\\nSome of the 200 recommendations included in the report involve policies to make homes cosier and heated with clean heat pumps, ensure new houses are energy-efficient and can cope with heatwaves, drive the shift to electric vehicles, and encourage people to eat less meat.\\nThese latest progress reports to parliament \u2013 one on reducing emissions and one on adapting to\u00a0climate\u00a0change \u2013 show the UK is off track to meet commitments made under the global Paris\u00a0climate\u00a0deal to cut emissions by 2030 and legal carbon-cutting targets for the late 2020s and 2030s.\\nThe committee also urged the government to engage with the public on the\u00a0climate\u00a0crisis, to provide people with information and involve them in the coming changes needed to meet the targets.\\nAll policies must be judged against a \u2018net-zero\u2019 test to ensure they are compatible with\u00a0climate\u00a0targets, and the Planning Bill should be amended to make sure new developments cut emissions and are prepared for rising temperatures.\\nMinisters must also give greater priority to adapting to the already inevitable impacts of\u00a0climate\u00a0change, such as overheating in buildings, as the UK is falling behind on coping with the risks the country faces, the reports warn.\\nThe committee said meeting the UK\u2019s long-term legally-binding target to cut emissions to net-zero by 2050 will cost less than 1% of GDP a year, and could deliver a boost of 2% by 2035 as the UK builds back from the pandemic.\\nBut failing to meet the goal exposes the country to far greater costs and chaos, and risks undermining British leadership as the UK hosts the international Cop26\u00a0climate\u00a0talks which aim to drive global action to curb rising temperatures, it warns.\\nClimate\u00a0Change Committee chief executive Chris Stark said the advisory body is very concerned about where things stand, as it delivered its last reports before the talks in Glasgow in November.\\n\u2018It\u2019s been a year when the government has been willing to make genuinely historic commitments on\u00a0climate, but the targets they have set are not going to be achieved by magic, so surprisingly little has been done so far to deliver on them,\u2019 he said.\\nCommittee chairman Lord Deben said the commitments the government has made to cut emissions by 68% by 2030 under the Paris deal and by 78% by 2035 under domestic legislation are remarkable decisions which set a major example.\\n\u2018The trouble is the action, the delivery has just not been there,\u2019 he said, warning that the government needs to step up rapidly.\\nThe government is expected to publish its net-zero strategy ahead of Cop26, and Lord Deben said it is crucial to have a clear and detailed strategy before the summit takes place.\\n\u2018If we don\u2019t have that it will be very difficult for the government to make Cop26 stand up, because everyone is looking for action and delivery, not just promises.\\n\u2018At Cop we will be making that distinction as a country, we will be saying to people when you sign up for things you\u2019ve got to deliver, and if we haven\u2019t shown the way in which we\u2019re going to deliver, then we will not be able to make Cop be a success.\u2019\\n\u2018The whole concept of global Britain being a leader will be undermined,\u2019 he warned.\\nThe committee warned that strategies such as how to cut carbon from buildings have been delayed and the government has not set out its ambitions in politically difficult areas such as diet changes or curbing demand for flights.\\nWhile emissions fell by 13% last year as a result of the pandemic, there has been little in the way of underlying changes in areas such as transport, and\u00a0climate\u00a0pollution is expected to rebound as the UK recovers from Covid-19.\\nMr Stark warned that it is two years since the 2050 net-zero goal \u2013 which involves cutting emissions as close to zero as possible and offsetting remaining pollution with measures such as planting trees \u2013 became law, and every month that passes without policies makes it harder to get on track.\\nThe reports call for measures ranging from action to cut emissions from homes and transport and reduce aviation demand to efforts to encourage people to cut meat consumption by a fifth by 2030, restoring and ending burning on peatland, and helping people move from high-carbon to low-carbon jobs.\\nThe Treasury must back\u00a0climate\u00a0action, making it a priority in this year\u2019s Spending Review and ensuring departments and local authorities have the resources they need.\\nMr Stark also warned: \u2018People seem to have been lost in all of this, and the public is crying out for more information on what lies ahead.\\n\u2018There is a genuine need to engage people across the country, to bring them with us on the net-zero challenge,\u2019 he said.\\nResponding to the reports, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said they lay bare the yawning chasm between government rhetoric and reality.\\n\u2018This is the decisive decade and we cannot afford the Conservatives\u2019 complacency, inaction and lack of direction.\\n\u2018The government owes it to the country to take heed and get on with the hard yards of investment and delivery necessary to protect us from the greatest long-term threat we face and to realise the huge benefits that the transition to net-zero promises,\u2019 he said.\\nGreen campaigners accused the government of talking the talk but failing to walk the walk on\u00a0climate\u00a0action, with Greenpeace UK\u2019s Doug Parr warning: \u2018Time is running out to show true\u00a0climate\u00a0leadership ahead of November\u2019s Glasgow\u00a0climate\u00a0summit.\u2019\\nTanya Steele, the chief executive at the World Wildlife Fund, likewise wasn\u2019t impressed.\\n\u2018This assessment reveals an alarming lack of progress in meeting our net zero commitments which is not just disappointing \u2013 it\u2019s dangerous,\u2019 she said.\\n\u2018We have long backed the Climate Change Committee\u2019s recommendation of a net zero test to ensure all government spending and policy, including in the planning system, are compatible with our climate targets.\\n\u2018The government needs to do this urgently, alongside a credible strategy to reach net zero, if it is to close the gap between its ambition and its action. We won\u2019t forget the promises that have been made \u2013 and future generations won\u2019t forgive a lack of urgent action.\u2019\\nA government spokesperson said any suggestion they had been slow to deliver\u00a0climate\u00a0action \u2018is widely off the mark\u2019, and pointed to progress in recent months including record investment, a new UK emissions trading scheme, \u00a35.2 billion investment in flood and sea defences and plans to decarbonise heavy industry and North Sea oil.\\n\u2018Our forthcoming strategies on heat and buildings, hydrogen, transport and comprehensive net zero strategy this year will set out more of the very policies the\u00a0Climate\u00a0Change Committee is calling for as we redouble our efforts to end the UK\u2019s contribution to\u00a0climate\u00a0change,\u2019 the spokesperson said.\\nMORE : What we must do to protect the UK from climate catastrophe\\nMORE : World\u2019s wildlife under threat from climate change, report warns\\nPrivacy Policy", "image": [["The Climate Change Committee\u2019s progress report says not enough is being done to curb emissions (Shutterstock)", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PRI_172546845.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=644%2C430"], ["Climate change activists listen to speeches at their encampment blocking the road junction at Oxford Circus back in 2019 (AFP)", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/client-mu-plugins/metro-branding/images/fallback.png"], ["Cop26 sand art next to the 26 ice sculptures of children installed on New Brighton Beach, Wallasey in Merseyside.
