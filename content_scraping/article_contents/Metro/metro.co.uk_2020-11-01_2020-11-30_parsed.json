Each item is made from recycled cotton fibres mixed with recycled plastic.\\nDesigners Vin and Omi say that climate change and the pandemic inspired the design.\\n\u2018The planet, politics and people are going through a really rough time with pandemic, environmental crisis, and political uncertainty,\u2019 they say.\\n\u2018We wanted to enforce that we all need to have HOPE and a positive attitude to get through this.\u2019\\nVin and Omi have a legacy of making clothes without using virgin resources.\\nIn 2018, the duo made handbags and jewellery using single use bottles discarded from the menswear show at London Fashion Week. They currently have an ongoing project turning nettles into fabric using refuse from Prince Charles\u2019s Highgrove Estate.\\nThey say: \u2018All of our work is eco and sustainable.
