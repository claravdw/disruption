That\u2019s a terrible word to use, but she only agreed to appear on the Oscars if she would be in the director\u2019s chair, because she\u2019s been having back trouble,\u2019 he said on the Jess Cagle Show, explaining that she had experienced back pains beforehand.\\n\u2018She said, \u201cI don\u2019t want people to see me limping out there\u2026 You know, I want to look good. I don\u2019t want people to worry about me.\u201d\u2019\\nMichael claimed that the slap drama between Will Smith and Chris Rock sparked chaos behind-the-scenes, and the plans changed \u2018literally five minutes\u2019 before Liza was due to present.\\n\u2018I guess they were all shaken up because of everything that had happened earlier, the stage manager said, \u201cWell, she has to be in a wheelchair\u201d,\u2019 he continued.\\n\u2018Liza pleaded. She said, \u201cNo, I will not be seen in a wheelchair in front of everybody. I will not do this. I refuse to do this\u201d.\\n\u2018Then they said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s either that or nothing.\u201d\u2019\\nMichael said that he witnessed the exchange and asked his friend what she wanted to do, and she replied that she would appear \u2013 but was left \u2018shaken\u2019 from the encounter.\\n\u2018She was so shaken that she was discombobulated. She was nervous. I mean, and it made her look like she was out of it. And she was just so shaken up,\u2019 he added.\\n\u2018Can you imagine being suddenly forced to be seen by millions of people the way you don\u2019t want to be seen? That\u2019s what happened to her.\u2019\\n\u2018She was very disappointed that that happened, and it was not what was agreed to. She is really doing well and it\u2019s a shame that it turned out that way.
