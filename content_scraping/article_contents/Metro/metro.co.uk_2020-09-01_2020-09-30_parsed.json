The end\u2019 following the death of George Floyd, the actor wrote in a column for The Spectator: \u2018Righteous global outrage at a cruel and vile killing has morphed into a different agenda.\u00a0Similar things have happened with other movements; #MeToo, Extinction Rebellion, Brexit, even the Covid-19 pandemic.\\n\u2018The left rightly expose great chasms of inequality and hypocrisy in society \u2014 then proceed to throw themselves like lemmings into that void, unable to obey their own edicts.\\n\u2018Desperately important causes have been politicised to the point of meaninglessness, opportunities for action hijacked swiftly by the cynical actors.\u2019\\nHe has since used the hashtag #AllLivesMatter rather than #BlackLivesMatter.\\nToday, the 42-year-old shared a screenshot of a text conversation with Front, as well as revealing that the 56-year-old had blocked him.\\nIn the messages, Fox asked: \u2018Why would you block me? Have I said anything that could upset you? What a shame. Anyway, you are never blocked from me.\u2019\\nFront, who played Jean Innocent opposite Fox\u2019s James Hathaway in Lewis, replied: \u2018Oh Lol, I think it was the #AllLivesMatter stuff that finally tipped me over the edge It seems to me so glaringly obvious that All Lives Matter \u2013 you\u2019d have to be a psychopath to disagree \u2013 that it should be equally obvious it doesn\u2019t need a slogan.\\n\u2018Black Lives are systematically undervalued. Their work opportunities are fewer, their health outcomes far worse, the criminal justice system works against them. I think the least we can do is let them have a f***ing slogan.\\n\u2018But there are many, many things we clearly disagree on and, fond as I am of you, looking at your Twitter feed I just felt uncomfortable about the company you\u2019re keeping.\\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry. I wish you and your lovely boys well. We\u2019ll just have to agree to differ.\u2019\\nFox replied: \u2018\u201cThe least we\u2019re can do is let them have a f***ing slogan.\u201d Jesus/\\n\u2018It\u2019s ok to disagree. But it\u2019s the right thing to do to talk first before you cancel me. Especially given how racist the phrase you just wrote is. I thought we had more in common.\u2019\\nThe actor tweeted: \u2018This is the most painful cancellation I have had yet. From someone I spent 10 happy years working with, many lovely family dinners and lots and lots of laughs. Someone I thought was a friend. #AllLivesMattter [sic].\u2019\\nThe actor has been mocked for the post, with many people explaining in the replies that blocking someone or disagreeing with them doesn\u2019t mean they are cancelling you.\\nIn response to one person who tweeted: \u2018Blocking someone isn\u2019t \u2018cancelling\u2019 them. You\u2019ve made it a public issue, she hasn\u2019t\u2019, Fox wrote: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m so sorry Aaron. I should have double checked the meaning of the words I\u2019m permitted to use with you before deploying them. It won\u2019t happen again.\\n\u2018On another point. You don\u2019t own the language. Have a nice day.\u2019\\nElsewhere, other famous faces have defended Front, with Chizzy Akadolu writing: \u2018Worked with Rebecca Front on Death in Paradise. I adored her before that. Besotted afterwards. She\u2019s funny, professional and extremely caring. Please read the whole exchange with Lawrence Fox before commenting on what she said. Context is everything!!\u2019\\nThank you to my many lovely friends, old and new. An apology has been made, so let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all move on.\\nHer The Thick Of It co-star Chris Addison tweeted: \u2018For the record, Rebecca Front is \u2013 and always has been \u2013 one of the greatest humans. I love her\u2019, while Katy Brand wrote: \u2018Always loved working and chatting with Rebecca Front. Long days on set will show who someone really is (ahem), and she has never been anything less than patient, fun and totally on her game however late it gets. Total babe.\u2019\\nFox has since issued a public apology to Front, tweeting: \u2018Earlier I tweeted a private text message. It isn\u2019t true to my values to make a private conversation public just to make a point. I regret it.\\n\u2018I would like to apologise to@RebeccaFront for doing so. I\u2019m going to delete the tweet and try to build bridges rather than burn them.\u2019\\nNighty Night star Front also tweeted: \u2018Thank you to my many lovely friends, old and new.
