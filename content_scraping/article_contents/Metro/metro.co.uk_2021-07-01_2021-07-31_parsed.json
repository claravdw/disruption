She was summoned to appear before city magistrates this week and says she has been \u2018harassed\u2019 by bailiffs since she stopped paying in 2019.\\nDespite this, she says she plans to refuse to pay tax until council leaders \u2018demonstrate that they are seeking to listen to and represent Leicester people and the environment, at a real and relevant level\u2019.\\nExtinction Rebellion encourages its members to participate in an Earth Tax Strike as part of its \u2018money disobedience\u2019 campaign.\\nThe group believes the Government does not use taxes \u2018to keep us safe\u2019 and instead puts public money \u2018into fossil fuel subsidies, condition-free bailouts for polluting industries, and HS2, an aviation shuttle service that is destroying nature\u2019.\\nLeicester City Council declared a climate emergency in January 2019 but Ms Wilden said this \u2018seemed like an empty gesture\u2019.\\nShe went on: \u2018I believe that as individuals we should contribute to the welfare of the community and the wider world.\\n\u2018However, in my view, Leicester City Council is not doing either of these things to a standard or with the degree of urgency, that the planet and the public requires.\\n\u2018We are in a Climate and Ecological Emergency. Our councils need to behave accordingly.\u2019\\nShe accused the council of cutting down trees to build roads, using harmful chemicals to spray verges and shredding plastic rubbish in parks by not litter-picking before mowing.\\nBut Leicester City Council told LeicestershireLive it is one of \u2018the most progressive councils in the country when it comes to addressing the climate emergency\u2019.\\nDeputy mayor Adam Clarke said: \u2018We have had several constructive meetings with Extinction Rebellion locally and sympathise with many of their concerns about climate change.\\n\u2018But everyone has to pay their council tax, which funds vital services \u2013 including our local response to the climate emergency.\\n\u2018Our commitments include extending the city\u2019s tree canopy and tree numbers, fitting energy efficient measures to council homes and schools, and investing heavily in walking, cycling and low-carbon public transport, including our new ebike share scheme, which will be the largest of its type in the country.\\n\u2018Collecting debts such as council tax takes resources away from other services.\\n\u2018I would urge Extinction Rebellion to continue dialogue with us rather than taking this counter-productive approach\u2019.\\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.\\nFor more stories like this, check our news page.\\nPrivacy Policy", "image": [["Karen Wilden is participating in Extinction Rebellions\u2019s Earth Tax Strike (Picture: BPM Media)", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SEI_85650411.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=644%2C338"], ["Karen Wilden has been summoned to appear in front of city magistrates this week (Picture: BPM Media)", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/client-mu-plugins/metro-branding/images/fallback.png"]], "author": ["Jordan King"], "date": "2021-07-02"}}
