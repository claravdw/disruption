Ryanair for example has cut some of its summer schedule because of the delay. Wizz Air has also had to cut its summer schedule because of required engine checks for its Airbus planes. The cumulative effect of this aircraft shortage means fewer flights, more expensive fares and potentially longer delays if an aircraft is taken out of service at the last minute.", "\u2022 Boeing 737 Max: which airlines use them and how dangerous are they?", "In the Middle East, airlines have had to amend their flight routes to avoid Iranian airspace after Israel launched retaliatory strikes.

Those with a transit in the Middle East may also see an increase in the possibility of missed flight connections if there are delays.", "And if air travel wasn\u2019t already blighted with enough obstacles, there may also be further protests by Just Stop Oil on the horizon. The activist group has already targeted UK airports this summer, including Stansted, where activists sprayed two private jets were sprayed with orange paint. In July, protesters blocked a security gate at Gatwick airport\u2019s south terminal using suitcases with lock-on devices. The nature of Just Stop Oil\u2019s protests means that any further action this summer will be unexpected, but the UK\u2019s biggest and busiest airports and roads leading to them will likely be targets.", "Air traffic control strikes and those by airport staff not directly employed by an airline are considered \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d, which means you won\u2019t be due any compensation from the airline. However, airlines still have certain legal obligations and a duty of care if you\u2019re already travelling.", "If your flight is cancelled then the airline needs to either offer you a full refund for the journey, as well as for any affected return flights on the same booking, to be reimbursed within seven days, or offer you an alternative flight, including with a rival airline in some cases.", "\u2022 Everything you need to know about compensation for cancelled and delayed flights", "If your flight is delayed for an extended period, the airline needs to provide you with a reasonable amount of food and drink, a means for you to communicate, accommodation if your flight isn\u2019t until the next day, and transfers to and from the accommodation.", "In some cases, you\u2019ll be provided vouchers for these items but often you are expected to claim back reasonable expenses from the airline afterwards, so keep your receipts.", "You could still end up with out-of-pocket costs and, in this instance, a comprehensive travel insurance policy may be handy.
