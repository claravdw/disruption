Fingers of sunlight break through the patchwork-green canopy overhead, illuminating them. A cobalt-winged butterfly flits past, mesmerising in its brilliance.\\nDrying off quickly in the hot Amazon sun, the youngsters scramble up a muddy path to their village of Sawr\u00c3\u00a9 Muybu, home to about 130 indigenous Munduruku people \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one in a chain of Munduruku settlements that stretch along the Tapajos River in the northern Brazilian state of Para. One small girl wears a silvery marmoset on her head as if it were a hat. A boy clutches a pet coati with a long striped tail.\\nUnder a thatched shelter behind the chief\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house, their parents sit around a communal cooking fire. Many have fish-scale or tortoiseshell designs inked across their faces, arms and legs. A bright-green parakeet darts from shoulder to shoulder and a pet monkey chatters under a table. A few hunters with knives and bows wander in, bearing a wild boar that will be skinned, cooked and shared, eaten with yams grown in their small plantations. There are a few incongruous signs of modernity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a fridge, a satellite dish, mobile phones, a generator and a sit-on toilet \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but in other ways life for these people, existing side by side with nature, has barely changed for centuries.\\nAny sense of an idyll, however, is shattered by a droning, throbbing hum \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the unmistakable sound of a large motor. Immediately in front of the village on the river is a monstrous dredging platform, two storeys high, cobbled together Heath Robinson-style from scrap metal and parts including the landing gear of an Airbus.\\nInside, four men are sifting through silt pumped up from the riverbed, which cascades down wooden ramps. They are garimpeiros \u00e2\u0080\u0094 gold prospectors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 looking for nuggets. The residue is made into what look like black doormats that will be taken along the river to the nearby town of Itaituba to process. The men, all from the northeast of Brazil, the poorest part of the country, dredge from dawn to dusk, for 12-14 hours, and on a good day will retrieve 20g of gold: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDa para sobreviver,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they tell me \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cEnough to live on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\nThe Munduruku, who number about 14,000, have the misfortune to live in the most gold-rich region in Brazil and though mining for gold in indigenous lands is illegal, the Brazilian government has no intention, it seems, to enforce the law \u00e2\u0080\u0094 indeed, it is trying to change it.\\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese gold-dredgers are not new. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new is how brazen it is \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a free-for-all. Before, they used to hide up channels,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Mauricio Torres, a professor at the Federal University of Para who has been travelling in the area for 20 years, studying conflicts on indigenous lands. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe real villains are not these men but the owners outside,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he adds. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDredges like these cost a million reals [\u00c2\u00a3135,000] and are run by organised groups.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\nThe damage is clear to see. The dredging has turned the river, which the Munduruku consider sacred, from pale blue to muddy brown. Large sandbanks have piled up in front of the village jetty. The mercury the dredgers use to separate the gold from the sandy soil pollutes the river and contaminates their fish.\\nLast year a child died of mercury poisoning. Mercury has also been linked to birth defects and neurological disorders. A recent study by Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Fiocruz health institute in partnership with the World Wildlife Fund found that 58 per cent of Munduruku tested in the Tapajos River region had levels of mercury higher than that considered safe.\\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not all the Munduruku have to contend with. To get to Sawr\u00c3\u00a9 Muybu involved me taking two flights from Rio, an eight-hour boat trip along the Tapajos, a two-hour car journey, then two hours in a canoe. But being remote has not protected them. Illegal loggers have invaded the area. Then there is what is known locally as grilagem \u00e2\u0080\u0094 land-grabbing to grow soya or rear beef cattle for the global food industry.\\nBrazil is the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest meat exporter. In 2016 the Munduruku narrowly avoided having their lands flooded when government plans to build a vast hydroelectric dam across the Tapajos were halted by protests. Now the government wants to construct a ferrogr\u00c3\u00a3o \u00e2\u0080\u0094 grain railway \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to transport soya to the huge port in Itaituba, from where it is exported to China and Europe.\\nThe fate of the planet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest rainforest will be high on the agenda when world leaders gather in Glasgow today for the Cop26 climate change conference, which the host, Boris Johnson, has insisted must be a \u00e2\u0080\u009cturning point for humanity\u00e2\u0080\u009d. For those on the ground in the Amazon, the turning point has arrived.\\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are in a state of war,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Cacique Juarez Saw Munduruku, 61, the village chief, his lined face furrowing. This is nothing new for the Munduruku, a warrior clan who over the centuries have fought off rival tribes and Portuguese colonialists alike, and are known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cfire ants\u00e2\u0080\u009d because of their mass assaults. Their word for stranger \u00e2\u0080\u0094 pariwati \u00e2\u0080\u0094 also means enemy and they once had a reputation for placing the severed heads of their adversaries on spikes.\\nToday their main enemy is the Brazilian government. Since the end of the military dictatorship in the 1980s, no regime has been as openly hostile towards the Munduruku and other indigenous groups as that of President Jair Bolsonaro. A former army captain, he has long contested the amount of land reserved as tribal territory. As a congressman in the late 1990s, he raged: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shame the Brazilian cavalry wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as efficient as the Americans, who exterminated the Indians.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\nDuring his presidential campaign in 2018, many of Bolsonaro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backers were in agribusiness. He vowed that once elected, he would not designate \u00e2\u0080\u009ca single centimetre more\u00e2\u0080\u009d of land as indigenous territory, insisting the tribes had too much already.\\nAlthough the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constitution of 1988 guaranteed land to all Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 305 tribes and stated that indigenous territories should have all been demarcated by now, Bolsonaro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s administration has halted the process, leaving a third of indigenous land yet to be demarcated and 237 requests pending \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including that of Sawr\u00c3\u00a9 Muybu.\\nHe has also reduced Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capacity to protect existing reserves by slashing funding to the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s environmental agency, Ibama, and sacking thousands of government functionaries charged with monitoring them. This has emboldened those intent on plundering the forest, pushing deforestation to its highest level for 13 years, and has left indigenous communities even more vulnerable to encroachments and violent attacks.\\nThe Sunday Times Magazine first alerted the world to the plight of the indigenous people living in the Amazon in 1969, in a cover story by the writer Norman Lewis headlined \u00e2\u0080\u009cGenocide\u00e2\u0080\u009d. That led to an international outcry and campaign. Fiona Watson, director of advocacy for Survival International, an organisation created in response to Lewis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s article to give indigenous peoples a voice on the world stage, says the situation is desperate.\\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident Bolsonaro has launched the biggest assault on indigenous peoples since the military dictatorship,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe situation is without doubt the worst I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in 35 years working in Brazil and certainly the most dangerous time in decades to be indigenous, as violence against their communities is escalating and the destruction of their Amazon homeland has reached catastrophic proportions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\nLast year was the most violent to date, with a record 1,576 land disputes, according to Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Pastoral Land Commission, a church organisation that has been tracking land invasions since 1985. Almost half were against indigenous people. Few aggressors are ever brought to justice, and nowhere are there more attacks than in the state of Para.\\nGarimpeiros have turned particularly aggressive. In May this year, gold prospectors invaded a village in the Munduruku reserve, firing guns and setting houses on fire. One of the houses burnt to the ground belonged to the village chief and another was the home of Maria Leusa Munduruku, an indigenous leader and co-ordinator of the local women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease come, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chaos, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to burn my house \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They are shooting, please help me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried in an audio message sent to APIB, Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest indigenous organisation, just before communication with the village was cut off.\\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey arrived with petrol in soft-drink bottles, armed and shooting,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said afterwards. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe received phone messages saying we had to be killed because we were getting in the way, that we were denouncing their activities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\nMany of the Munduruku now leading the battle against the invaders are women. On my third morning staying with the community, sleeping in a hammock in their school room, I hear a commotion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe warriors are back!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The shout resounds through the village, sending parrots and chickens squawking and children with painted faces scurrying.\\nJuarez Saw Munduruku, the village chief, and a small band of men, women and teenage boys with hair dyed green or purple, have spent the past four days armed with GPS devices as well as bows and arrows and machetes, hacking their way through dense jungle to hammer wooden signs printed with the words Terra Protegida (Protected Land) onto tree trunks on the edges of their territory.\\nThe signs look official but are in fact copies. Though their land was mapped by Ibama in 2014 the authorities have never officially declared it a reserve, so the Munduruku have been forced into what they call self-demarcation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 installing signs around the edge of all 434,900 acres of their ancestral land, as a warning to those who would plunder its riches.\\nLagging behind in flip-flops, exhausted after the long hike, battling with humidity as well as the threat of venomous snakes, scorpions, spiders, even jaguars, walks a pint-sized woman dressed in a grass skirt with a headband of orange and black feathers over her long black hair. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe world talks about environment but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the ones whose feet are cut to pieces,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Alessandra Korap Munduruku, 37, a mother of two boys and the tribe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign co-ordinator, who tells me she will be travelling to Glasgow to alert the world to their plight. After a refreshing dip in the brook, she sits by a mango tree from which a monkey swings on a rope and explains how she became the Munduruku\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first female warrior.\\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI got involved in 2015 when I attended a course on the rights of indigenous people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never thought how, when they stopped us fishing by polluting our water, they were actually taking our rights. So I joined the fight with the cacique [chief] \u00e2\u0080\u0094 only I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t because I am a woman and women have to stay quiet. In our society, women are married off at 12 or 13. I was lucky, as I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t marry till 21. My own mother said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Alessandra, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak, let the cacique speak.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Why not?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I had always been a rebel and questioned everything, was always in fights. So I began to speak at meetings. To start with people were shocked but now they say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wait for Alessandra to see what she thinks.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009d\\nShe started accompanying Cacique Juarez to Brasilia, the capital, for meetings, but soon branched out on her own. Last month she addressed the senate to warn of the impact of the proposed railway.\\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI discovered many things from dealing with whites,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf they give, they always want something in return.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\nShe began studying law at the Federal University of Western Para after learning that two places were being offered for indigenous students. More than 500 applied but she was chosen. She has struggled to keep up with the course alongside her work organising resistance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a challenge to be a woman, to be in the struggle, to be a mum, to be a warrior \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it feels as if I have the world on my shoulders,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says.\\nLike Maria Leusa, she risks her life for her cause. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am threatened like mad but I refuse to stay quiet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she shrugs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is war and we must prepare for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In 2019, when she travelled to Brasilia with other indigenous leaders, her house was broken into and her bag and documents stolen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfterwards my son hugged me and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mum, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want them to kill you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009d\\nSince then she rarely stays in one place. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy should I feel fear? The people who should feel fear are those who are doing wrong. The greatest fear I have is my people being expelled from their territory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\nYet the war people like Alessandra are fighting is for the whole of humanity. The Amazon not only contains 10 per cent of the planet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biodiversity but plays a vital role in mitigating climate change by acting as a sink, absorbing and storing carbon dioxide, and is often referred to as the lungs of the world. When cut or burnt down, the forest not only ceases to fulfil this function but also releases the stored carbon back into the atmosphere.\\nUnder Bolsonaro deforestation has continued relentlessly. Between August last year and this July, 10,476 sq km of forest was wiped out \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an area nearly seven times bigger than Greater London, according to data released by Imazon, a Brazilian research institute that has been tracking Amazon deforestation since 2007.\\nSo much so that for the first time, parts of the forest are emitting more CO2 than they absorb. Scientists are warning that as much as 40 per cent of the Amazon has been so devastated that it is reaching a point of no return, at which it could switch from a rainforest to a savanna, which would have profound effects on the global climate.\\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are headed for a catastrophic temperature rise of 3-5C this century,\u00e2\u0080\u009d warned Antonio Guterres, secretary-general of the UN. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaking peace with nature is the defining task of the 21st century. It must be the top priority for everyone, everywhere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\nBolsonaro insists he agrees. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhich other country in the world has a policy of environmental protection like ours?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked in his speech at the UN general assembly last month. In a way he is correct: other countries have long ago cut down their forests, whereas international alarm at the terrifying rate of Amazonian deforestation in the 1980s led Brazil to enact conservation measures and the rate slowed. But now Bolsonaro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s administration has been trying to roll back these measures. He claimed that deforestation was down in August, but shocking photos released by Greenpeace suggested otherwise.\\nBolsonaro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s environment minister, Ricardo Salles, was forced to resign in June after the Brazilian supreme court announced an investigation into allegations that he and top officials in his ministry helped companies traffic illegally logged rainforest wood to Europe and the United States.\\nThat followed the largest seizure of illegal timber in Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history \u00e2\u0080\u0094 eight million cubic feet of wood \u00e2\u0080\u0094 on the border between Para and Amazonas states, which police claimed they had been instructed to release.\\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo one protects the forest better than indigenous people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Professor Torres at the University of Para. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMunduruku are the front line of resistance \u00e2\u0080\u0094 particularly the women. They are preserving the forest for themselves and their children, but it has an impact for the whole world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\nEarlier this year Alessandra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bravery was recognised with the Robert Kennedy Human Rights Award. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never imagined I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get a prize in my life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she laughs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy relatives always complained I was a troublemaker. But now they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re proud and want their daughters to be like us. In the past I walked alone, it was just me and Maria Leusa. Today there are a band of girls.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\nNot only are women at the forefront but they are employing very different means from warriors of the past. Among them is Beka Munduruku, just turned 18, often referred to as the Greta of the Amazon, who posts photos on Instagram of herself and her jungle habitat. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy life used to be just playing but then I saw how they were destroying our river and home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy people need to get our story out. Now we use WhatsApp, Facebook and Insta as weapons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\nBeka is part of a high-tech all-female team headed by Aldira, a former village teacher. While her husband looks after their four children, including a three-month-old baby, Aldira travels around with a drone, mapping deforestation and land invasions, then sends her videos to the authorities.\\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything, but at least we register it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says. I watch her launch the drone over an area stripped of trees, dressed in a grass skirt and feathers, arms and legs decorated with black war paint. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fight for the forest, who will?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she adds. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe forest gives us life and has life like us. To us, everything in the forest and river are sacred and this banditry will have consequences.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\nShe tells me how the Munduruku have become fearful of eating fish, once a mainstay of their diet, owing to the fear of contamination from mercury. The problem is not just the dredger.\\nOne morning Anderson Paygo, 32, wearing a graphic T-shirt printed with the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cF*** You\u00e2\u0080\u009d over his thickly muscled arms, takes us by canoe up the river to see a goldmine. The grandson of the former chief, he is co-ordinator of 11 villages on the river, representing about 1,200 people.\\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have a lot of richness in wood, gold, even diamonds \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and this government encourages people to take them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says.\\nLast year Bolsonaro introduced a draft bill in congress to allow mining and other commercial activities in indigenous territories, part of what Greenpeace has denounced as the Destruction Package. The bill is listed as one of Bolsonaro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s priorities. The National Mining Agency has received 2,899 requests to mine in indigenous territories, 1,265 in lands where there are uncontacted tribes).\\nAmong them are 86 applications from the mining giant Anglo American, including in Munduruku land, though it is believed to have withdrawn some recently after questions were raised at a shareholders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 meeting.\u00e2\u0080\u009cNeither Anglo American nor any of its subsidiaries hold any exploration permits on indigenous lands in Brazil,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the company says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have withdrawn all applications for mineral exploration in areas located within indigenous lands, but several of these applications have not yet been removed from the database of the National Mining Agency (ANM).\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\nSome communities might lose their land altogether if a case known as Marco Temporal, or the \u00e2\u0080\u009cTime Limit Trick\u00e2\u0080\u009d, is passed by the supreme court. It follows a federal regional court ruling that it would only recognise tribal lands occupied by native communities at the time Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constitution was ratified in 1988 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which saw the territory of one tribe, the Xokleng, drastically reduced on the basis they were living on only a fraction of it.\\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt feels like we are fighting grileiros [invaders] from every side,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Paygo says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if the government passes those laws it will be much worse. In the past our life here was very free, just hunting and fishing, but now we have to patrol our land and our leadership have to leave the village a lot to campaign. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just time and effort but risk \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they want the heads of me and Alessandra. But we have to do it to defend the future of our families. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have fear for we are a warrior people and have always fought.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\nPaygo points out a strange indentation in the trees like a ski slope \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the Passage of the Wild Pigs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which he says is one of the tribe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most sacred sites. According to their legend, the Munduruku were created by their god, Karosakaybu, born from the seed of a palm tree in Sawr\u00c3\u00a9 Muybu. He first created fish and the river, then pigs that came down this passage to the river.\\nShortly after passing it, we come to a small beach and climb out. Three scrawny men are waiting on the bank for the fortnightly supply boat. Ze, 57, Manuel and Guido, both 56, are garimpeiros from the goldmine a few miles inland. Tracks from heavy machinery mark the way towards large craters, like scars in the forest. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSix years ago there were as many as 2,000 people here with bars, shops and women,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ze says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow there are just a few. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much gold left.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\nThe garimpeiros tell us they had no idea this was indigenous land. They say they haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been home in two years and had no alternative but to find work here.\\nTwo are divorced, one is separated and conditions in the jungle are grim, with frequent bouts of malaria. The supply boat comes and they load up with cooking oil, frozen chickens, a sack of corn, a long coil of sausage, tobacco and a couple of bottles of cacha\u00c3\u00a7a sugarcane spirit.\\nNot all garimpeiros are outsiders. Among those who attacked Maria Leusa were Munduruku who have turned their back on their ancient culture. The government has been trying to split the tribe, Paygo says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur God taught us to share, so when our people hunt and fish they always share everything, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the strategy of this government to pit one family against another. Unfortunately some Munduruku joined our enemy and became garimpeiros. Some of our own family threaten us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\nLast year Bolsonaro posted a video on social media declaring: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Indian has changed, he is evolving and becoming more and more a human being like us. What we want is to integrate him into society so he can own his land.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\nAlessandra and Cacique Juarez are trying to counter this by finding new sources of income. The chief has been planting coffee and cacao. Alessandra has opened a craft store in Itaituba, a steamy Wild West town full of gold shops and brothels as well as hardware stores selling tree-cutting tools. One gold shop has a \u00e2\u0080\u009cBar do Garimpeiro\u00e2\u0080\u009d inside, offering prospectors free drinks as their nuggets are weighed by young women in tight T-shirts and men in suits.\\nSome 17.7 tonnes of illegal gold entered the market from the state of Para last year, according to new figures from federal prosecutors, a third of it from garimpeiros in the Munduruku and Kayapo reserves. Some of this is believed to end up in the UK, which is the third biggest buyer of Brazilian gold.\\nNext to a pecking macaw, a small group of surly teenage Munduruku boys with blue-dyed hair sit smoking and playing on their phones. The chief worries that young people are losing interest in their heritage. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe chiefs are like libraries for our tribes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the past we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have TV but they have phones and games. Our children are not interested in the old stories and are losing their language. If we lose our language and culture, what will we have? Soon the government will say these are not indigenous people, they are Brazilians like any other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\nTo protect them, he is uniting with other indigenous tribes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even old enemies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must come together or this government will do away with all of us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cToday we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re living through a period of legislative genocide,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Dario Kopenawa, a leader of the Yanomami people, who have seen 20,000 garimpeiros flood into their territory. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are killing us with a pen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\nA few days after we leave, Alessandra herds 46 Munduruku onto a bus to Brasilia, a three-day journey, to take part in the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest ever demonstration by indigenous people. More than 6,000 representatives of some 176 tribes pitch tents and build bamboo shelters in which they camp for a seven-day protest titled Luta pela Vida, or Struggle for Life.\\nThey make a striking vision dressed in their brightly coloured feathers against the gleaming white space-age buildings of congress, the supreme court and the presidential palace. Among them is Beka, live streaming to her followers.\\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA lot of people still think of indigenous people as they were back in 1500, like something in a museum,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe still have our traditions but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learnt to use modern ways \u00e2\u0080\u0094 mobile phones, social media, speaking Portuguese \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and we women are feminists. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve stopped being indigenous people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\n@christinalamb\\nBy Ben Spencer, science editor\\nWorld leaders and environmental activists from 195 countries start gathering in Glasgow today for what is billed as the \u00e2\u0080\u009clast, best chance to save the planet\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The key focus is on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but the UK, as host of Cop26, is also pushing for an ambitious deal to halt and reverse global deforestation. Brazil, the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest beef exporter, is unlikely to play ball. If the deal falters, what can the rest of us do?\\nMuch of the food we eat either comes from or is linked to cleared land that used to be South American rainforest. Efforts to clean up the food industry have been muddied by the complexity of supply chains, particularly for processed foods such as ready meals and canned meat goods. Recent Greenpeace investigations into JBS \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an international meat giant whose UK customers include several supermarkets, restaurant chains and wholesalers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 found that among its suppliers were ranchers linked to deforestation. JBS insists it does not tolerate any illegal deforestation in the Amazon.\\nBut imported meat products are only part of the problem. Soya bean, a key driver of deforestation in the Amazon, is a main source of feed for British farm animals. Three quarters of the soya imported by the UK is used as animal feed. In Europe we eat twice as much meat and three times as much dairy as the global average. The Rainforest Foundation says we can make a difference by reducing our meat intake. And when we do eat meat, we should buy from local farms with sustainable practices.\\nPalm oil \u00e2\u0080\u0094 used in food and cosmetics \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is another driver of deforestation worldwide. Read the labels on products to see if they contain palm oil and whether it comes from a sustainable source.\\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDecades of inaction by governments and companies have created the crisis, emboldening the Brazilian government to further exploit the Amazon by pushing through some of the most destructive legislation ever seen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Anna Jones, head of forests at Greenpeace UK.\\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrusted brands still buy from forest destroyers despite promises to remove deforestation from their supply chains by 2020. Immediate action is needed on all fronts. Supermarkets must immediately drop meat suppliers owned by forest destroyers and governments must close legislative loopholes to ensure deforestation-free supply chains are exactly that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\nBrazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s illegally mined gold also finds its way to Britain. A report published last month by the Federal University of Minas Gerais found that three countries \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the UK, Switzerland and Canada \u00e2\u0080\u0094 buy 72 per cent of Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gold exports. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is very likely that those countries have imported gold linked to destructive activities in the Amazon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the authors said. Buyers should source gold that comes from a verified low-impact mine, or buy recycled gold.", "image": [["A Munduruku boy cuddles his coati", "https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Fsundaytimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2F762ee004-31ca-11ec-a1f1-3deca2439cf5.jpg?crop=1070%2C1337%2C206%2C108"], ["Body painting is a traditional part of growing up", "https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Fsundaytimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2F66fb1dc0-31a0-11ec-a1f1-3deca2439cf5.jpg?crop=2250%2C1500%2C0%2C0"], ["Village chief Juarez Saw Munduruku says his people are at war", "https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Fsundaytimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2F6ef4c698-31a0-11ec-a1f1-3deca2439cf5.jpg?crop=1300%2C1625%2C0%2C0"], ["A girl with her silvery marmoset", "https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Fsundaytimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2Fa7a1dd82-31a0-11ec-a1f1-3deca2439cf5.jpg?crop=1300%2C1625%2C0%2C0"], ["Munduruku children face a bleak future as deforestation threatens their remote village", "https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Fsundaytimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2F5a82e33e-31a0-11ec-a1f1-3deca2439cf5.jpg?crop=2250%2C1500%2C0%2C0"], ["The village is at the heart of the Munduruku territory", "https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Fsundaytimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2F90fcb64c-31a0-11ec-a1f1-3deca2439cf5.jpg?crop=2250%2C1500%2C0%2C0"], ["Dredging for gold causes deadly mercury pollution", "https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Fsundaytimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2F86ac833e-31a0-11ec-a1f1-3deca2439cf5.jpg?crop=2250%2C1500%2C0%2C0"], ["Alessandra Korap has taken up the fight", "https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Fsundaytimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2F3b0fb684-31a1-11ec-a1f1-3deca2439cf5.jpg?crop=2250%2C1500%2C0%2C0"], ["Villagers erect warning signs to deter land-grabbers", "https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Fsundaytimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2F690e8704-31a1-11ec-a1f1-3deca2439cf5.jpg?crop=2250%2C1500%2C0%2C0"], ["Illegal grain farms built on protected land", "https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Fsundaytimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2F3267d6b0-31a1-11ec-a1f1-3deca2439cf5.jpg?crop=2250%2C1500%2C0%2C0"], ["Jair Bolsonaro surveys the scarred landscape in 2019", "https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Fsundaytimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2Fa121c754-31ca-11ec-a1f1-3deca2439cf5.jpg?crop=2250%2C1500%2C0%2C0"], ["Grain and soya from cleared rainforest are transported to be shipped overseas", "https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Fsundaytimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2F69d51b58-31a1-11ec-a1f1-3deca2439cf5.jpg?crop=2250%2C1500%2C0%2C0"], ["The activist Aldira uses a drone to map rainforest clearance", "https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Fsundaytimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2F44c5b214-31a1-11ec-a1f1-3deca2439cf5.jpg?crop=2250%2C1500%2C0%2C0"], ["Beka, the Greta Thunberg of the Amazon, at a mass protest in Brasilia in August against plans to remove protection for indigenous land", "https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Fsundaytimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2F5905cdcc-31a1-11ec-a1f1-3deca2439cf5.jpg?crop=1300%2C1625%2C0%2C0"], ["Munduruku villagers at the protest after travelling to Brasilia for three days by bus", "https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Fsundaytimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2F60137178-31a1-11ec-a1f1-3deca2439cf5.jpg?crop=1300%2C1625%2C0%2C0"], ["The week-long Struggle for Life protest in Brasilia highlighted Bolsonaro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0098anti-indigenous agenda\u00e2\u0080\u0099", "https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Fsundaytimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2F7bf90272-31a1-11ec-a1f1-3deca2439cf5.jpg?crop=2250%2C1500%2C0%2C0"], ["The elders worry that the younger generation in Sawr\u00c3\u00a9 Muybu are losing their cultural identity to modern technology", "https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Fsundaytimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2F727036c6-31a1-11ec-a1f1-3deca2439cf5.jpg?crop=2250%2C1500%2C0%2C0"], ["A mother and child at Sawr\u00c3\u00a9 Muybu village", "https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Fsundaytimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2Fba200332-31a3-11ec-a1f1-3deca2439cf5.jpg?crop=2667%2C1500%2C0%2C0&resize=360"]], "author": [" | Graphics by ", " and Clare Collins"], "date": "2021-10-30"}}
