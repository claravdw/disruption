And although the couple experienced the stress of moving house during the first lockdown, Stacey reveals she wouldn\u2019t change a thing.\\n\u201cHe is just an angel,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel really fortunate to have him.\u201d\\nStacey, 33, fell for 38-year-old Kevin when she was paired with him on Strictly Come Dancing in 2018. The pair went on to win the hit BBC dance series \u2013 and have been inseparable ever since.\\nAs a professional dancer, Kevin clearly doesn\u2019t have two left feet \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t until he and Stacey upgraded from a flat to a house that she discovered he has green fingers. Now, Stacey reckons her home life is a bed of roses as she can\u2019t keep him away from the garden.\\n\u201cI call him Kev Titchmarsh,\u201d she joked. \u201cHe loves the garden.\\n\u201cWhen the lockdown kicked off, we were in this tiny flat and I thought, \u2018We need a house\u2019.\\n\u201cSo we bought the house and have a garden \u2013 and Kev is never out of it.\\n\u201cI think if I\u2019d have been single [during the lockdown], I\u2019d have been so lonely. It breaks my heart, the idea that people had to go through this alone.\u201d\\nStacey, who shot to fame in 2008 after appearing on BBC Three documentary, Blood, Sweat and T-Shirts, admits that living together can sometimes be a challenge, and like all couples, she and Kevin have their ups and downs. But one particular aspect of lockdown life she is struggling to deal with involves her marble table.\\nIn an online chat with fans on event site Fane, Stacey revealed: \u201cKev keeps using it and not putting coasters down. That\u2019s stressful.\u201d\\nStacey has had the chance to experience other people\u2019s home lives as part of her new UKTV show, Stacey Dooley Sleeps Over. She stays with members of the public across the country in order to get more of an insight into modern life in Britain.\\nOne of the families featured in the Wshow were environmentalists who refused to use electricity. As part of the online chat, entitled A Night In With Stacey Dooley, the star talked about the time she spent with the family in the Scottish Hebrides.\\nShe said: \u201cRock, the father, had two girls, Blue and Savannah. They\u2019ve always been really engaged with Extinction Rebellion and loved the planet and [they] think we\u2019re running out of time. So I went to live with them on their island for the weekend.\\n\u201cIt was so cold. This room is freezing so think how cold you are now and times it by 10.\\n\u201cThere was no hot water, no electricity, because they were trying to cut right down.\u201d\\nStacey, who was made an MBE in 2018, admits it is \u201cdifficult to dislike people who are trying to save the planet\u201d, but she added: \u201cI think it rubs some people the wrong way, because it can feel very preachy.\\n\u201cSome people think, \u2018Well, it\u2019s OK for you to sit in a field and protest for months, but I have to go to work, I have to feed the kids, I have to pay the bills\u2026\u2019 so sometimes there\u2019s a bit of friction.\\n\u201cYou need to spend time with people to see where they\u2019re coming from, don\u2019t you? I mean, this family, they live completely off-grid.\u201d\\nThe Scottish family also refused to use social media \u2013 which Stacey said was \u201cliberating\u201d.\\n\u201cBlue and Savannah have had their whole lives without social media; without being exposed to so much. That must be amazing,\u201d she said.\\n\u201cThey seem so free in their presence and very free in their bodies.\\n\u201cSavannah and Blue didn\u2019t really give a sh*t about what people thought of them, and I thought it was really liberating and really refreshing. We could probably all do with a bit of that.\u201d\\nStacey, who also presented Glow Up: Britain\u2019s Next Make-Up Star on BBC Three, says that visiting the family really made her think about the environment \u2013 and all the things she could personally do to improve it.\\n\u201cI hold my hands up. I\u2019m so far from perfect,\u201d she said.\\n\u201cI fly too much, the heating is always on, the kettle is always boiling\u2026 I really need to look at how I live, for sure. When I think about sustainability, I place a real importance on fashion so I\u2019ve really tried to turn my back on fast fashion, but that alone isn\u2019t enough.\\n\u201cThere are so many things I do that are taxing to the planet. It does give you food for thought.\u201d\\nHaving travelled the world to make documentaries on serious issues such as child labour and women in developing countries, Stacey has seen it all.\\nBut she also admits there have been some uncomfortable moments \u2013 including the time she had to wee in the back of a van.\\nBranding it one of her most embarrassing professional moments, Stacey said: \u201cI was filming in Thailand. We were driving back from somewhere we had filmed quite an intense scene.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard driving in Bangkok \u2013 their dual carriageways are relentless and you can\u2019t just stop if you need the toilet so I kept saying that I needed to go. I had no alternative but to go in the van.\\n\u201cThey said, \u2018Stacey, can you not just wait?\u2019 and I said, \u2018I absolutely can\u2019t!\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m emptying this icebox, I\u2019m taking out the cans of Coke and I\u2019m just like, ferociously taking the ice box to the back of the van.\u201d", "image": null, "author": null, "date": "2021-02-20"}}
