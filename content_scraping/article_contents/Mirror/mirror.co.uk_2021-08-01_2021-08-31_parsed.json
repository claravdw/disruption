This week, when my new bath arrived, it was too short for me. It also had the distinct look of a corner bath that one of the Golden Girls might have needed help getting in and out of!\\nI\u2019m not quite ready for that yet, so I\u2019ve ordered a bespoke one, roomy enough for me to splash around in. I\u2019m a real bath girl.\\nI could spend half a day soaking in my favourite bubbles with my laptop and snacks to hand, constantly topping up the hot water. I\u2019ve treated myself to bespoke baths in the past, and the men I\u2019ve dated have loved that.\\nAs you may know, I\u2019m rather partial to tall men (over 6ft 2in), so their eyes light up when they realise that not only can they fit in without cramping their legs up like they\u2019re on a cheap flight, but if they\u2019re lucky, there\u2019s enough space for me to join them!\\nThe renovation budget has gone out the window because I\u2019ve changed my mind so many times. In fact, the builders roll their eyes the moment I walk on site, but I always win them round by ordering Deliveroos (seems builders all eat McDonald\u2019s so at least that doesn\u2019t break the bank).\\nI\u2019ve already met lots of my new neighbours and it appears that my Chelsea address is the preferred destination of bleach-bottle blondes. This week I met sexy blonde Lizzie, an edgy Aussie with a great sense of humour. She took pity on the filthy state I was in and offered the use of her bathroom.\\nI\u2019d also exchanged pleasantries with the very young blonde Estonian stunner who\u2019s moving in with her much older boyfriend, to the flat overlooking my garden. After my visit to Lizzie\u2019s powder room, I found my place empty of builders. But I had an idea where they were\u2026\\nSure enough I called one of their mobiles to discover that the young Estonian blonde had asked if they could help move all her furniture in. With her size 8 figure, waist-length hair, high boobs and perky bum clad in skintight leggings, they were very happy to oblige \u2013 all eight of them!\\nKnowing that every moment counts when you\u2019re trying to finish a renovation, I was in no mood to lend anyone my crew, so I marched over to the open front door to witness my entire team doing her bidding.\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you usually move house,\u201d I told her, \u201cbut I suggest you get a removal company quickly, because I\u2019m paying for my team to work on my house, not yours!\u201d\\nThe guys, looking a bit embarrassed, swiftly retreated, but not before I heard one talking about how hot my neighbour is. I made a mental note to forget his order on my next fast-food run.\\nOh, and remember my neighbour Lottie, who lives in the penthouse here (paid for by Daddy)? She\u2019s asked my ex out on a date (he\u2019s the head builder in charge), so I\u2019m about to find myself in a battle of the blonde bombshells.\\nStay tuned lovely readers, I think our claws are set to get sharpened as The Real Housewives Of Chelsea collide\u2026\\nDo you have any renovation woes \u2013 or nightmare neighbour stories \u2013 to share?

It was the end of the evening and we were the only people in the restaurant. No one was within earshot of us, which was important to me as The Langham is a place that I go to all the time and I did not want this to be overheard by staff who served me regularly.\\nI placed one hand on my Chanel and readied myself to leave the table, but I had one last question left.\\n\u201cYou were never stood outside the registry office at all, were you?\u201d His face told me all I needed to know. \u201cYou lying b*****d.\u201d\\nHe looked shocked and shaken. \u201cDon\u2019t go, I can explain!\u201d he said.

I came here tonight to listen to your version of events that led up to what was one of the worst days of my life. Nothing you\u2019ve said makes what you did OK or forgivable.

Join the discussion in the comment section\\nAnd for three sisters from the Welsh Valleys, recollections of those days are still very much alive - memories they hope will inspire generations of activists against the new world threat of climate change.\\n\u201cIt taught me that you take your voice and you use it whenever you can,\u201d says Susan Lamb, 68, who joined the camp with siblings Lesley Brinkworth and Christine King.\\n\u201cI was just a housewife from the Rhondda, terrified what could happen to our children. We had to stand up for what we believed in, just as groups like Extinction Rebellion are doing now.\u201d\\nThe women \u2013 whose story is told in a new BBC documentary \u2013 had little notion of the global attention they would receive, or the sacrifices that would follow.\\nThey were slung in jail, threatened by anti-protest vigilantes \u2013 and Susan and Christine, 65, were even part of a group who took US President Ronald Reagan to court.\\n\u201cI was a different person at Greenham,\u201d their sister Lesley, 63, admits. \u201cWe learned to face our fears and that if people come together we can change the world.\u201d\\nIn the early Eighties, the shadow of nuclear war loomed large, with \u201cProtect and Survive\u201d pamphlets sent out advising families to create bunkers out of doors and cushions. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t live under this threat. Or let nuclear weapons in to kill our children\u201d says Susan, then pregnant.\\nThen the sisters heard of the march from a Cardiff weapons factory to Greenham to protest against US plans to store cruise missiles at the base.\\nWhen the Women for Life on Earth\u2019s journey failed to make the impact protesters hoped for, they set up camp there, with a small group chaining themselves to a fence. Determined to spread the word, the sisters set up their own local demo, joined by friends and activists.\\n\u201cWe camped a week in the middle of Porth square, a main thoroughfare in the Rhondda Valley,\u201d says Christine, who still lives there.\\nThey expected to be evicted. \u201cWe came with two shower curtains for shelter then local builders dropped off water and a hut for us to sleep in,\u201d says Lesley, who now lives near Tonypandy in Glamorgan.\\n\u201cOn the last day we camped it was pouring down but I thought, \u2018Oh my God, this is the best night of my life\u2019.\u201d Weeks later they were at Greenham, where protestors lived in cars and tents, without electricity or running water. \u201cWe had a cr\u00e8che caravan where all the children went,\u201d says Susan. \u201cWe met people from all over the world. It didn\u2019t matter what class or politics they were \u2013 we were united to get the cruise weapons out.\u201d\\nIn 1982, the sisters were part of a group of 23 women who stormed the entrance of Greenham base. They were jailed for 14 days for breaching the peace. Christine, who was also pregnant, says: \u201cThey were planning on fighting a nuclear war, my child wouldn\u2019t have a future.\u201d\\nLesley adds: \u201cIt was outrageous to lock up housewives for protesting. My clothes were sent to my family home from prison with no note. They thought something had happened to me. My mother\u2019s hair turned white overnight.\u201d Defiant, they returned to Greenham for 10-day stretches each month.\\nIn 1983 they were among thousands of women who formed a human chain around the airfield in an \u201cEmbrace the Base\u201d demo. It marked one of Lesley\u2019s most terrifying ordeals there.\\n\u201cI remember joyous singing, but how quickly it changed,\u201d she says. \u201cA policeman grabbed my head and the next thing I\u2019m flying through the air. Had I landed differently I\u2019m sure he\u2019d have broken my neck.\u201d\\nThere were threats women who entered the base would be shot. Vigilantes even set light to woods near the camp and poured farm slurry over women. Bailiffs tore down tents up to twice a day.\\nCamp members went on night watch. Greenham ended Lesley\u2019s marriage. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like me going there. I think he thought, \u2018Someone else\u2019s wife can do that\u2019. But Greenham gave me independence.\u201d\\nIn November 1983, shortly before the missiles arrived, Christine and Susan were in a group who flew to America to lodge a case in New York\u2019s Supreme Court against Reagan. They argued the deployment was illegal since the missiles were designed to be used first in response to conventional conflict.\\nThe court said the case was outside its jurisdiction. The first missile arrived days later, flooring the sisters and their friends.\\nIn 1985, Susan had to stop protesting after Crohn\u2019s disease left her housebound. But four years later came the news all Greenham women had been waiting for. The missiles were leaving.\\n\u201cOur pressure forced the Government\u2019s arm, no doubt about it,\u201d says Susan. \u201cWe had won.\u201d Since then Lesley has worked for years with families with specialist needs.\\nSusan, now in Pembrokeshire, went on to study a masters in women\u2019s development, before working for support groups. She still attends demos, this time with her grandchildren. \u201cI brought the kids up to be interested in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I left school I didn\u2019t have a lot of self-belief.\\n\u201cGreenham changed the way I see myself.\u201d Her only regret is its legacy didn\u2019t stop the Trident programme. \u201cI thought we\u2019d have got rid of it by now,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to be re-making that case.\\n\u201cBecause of Greenham I learned I could change the world.
