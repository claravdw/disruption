As you all know, I\u2019ve downsized my house and my lifestyle, and made a decision to pretty much stay single while I recalculate and recalibrate who I am after the pandemic.\\nThose of you who\u2019ve followed my writing career will know that my last book Ruthless Women was more successful than I could ever have dreamed of. This is a book that, firstly, my English teachers at school told me I could never write and, secondly, 39 publishers turned down, saying no one would read it.  And yet, instead of focusing on the sheer joy of seeing it translated into different languages across the world and selling nearly 200,000 copies, I\u2019ve taken opportunity after opportunity to use the profile its success has given me to make digs at people who treated me horribly on the way up.\\nElizabeth Taylor once famously said, \u201cSuccess is a great deodorant\u201d \u2013 and it\u2019s true! When you find yourself in a situation where everybody wants a piece of you, you notice just how fake so many people are \u2013 doubly more so when it\u2019s people that you know have never liked you and are suddenly trying to be your best friend. I can now see I\u2019ve used it as an excuse to vent my anger against fair-weather friends who\u2019d dropped me in the past and were suddenly everywhere I turned.\\nI\u2019ve also realised that, were it not for some of the toxic experiences I had with some of the most famous women in this country during my years as a talent agent, I wouldn\u2019t have had the inspiration to create the monstrous characters that people so love reading about. But it\u2019s now reached a point where I think I need to give up on the assumption that some people will change, or at least recognise that they owe you an apology for their behaviour.\\nI can\u2019t deny that I\u2019ve taken great pleasure in giving \u201ccertain people\u201d sleepless nights via this column \u2013 knowing they were reading it each week waiting to see whether I\u2019d out them for their appalling behaviour towards me in the past. But I feel like I\u2019ve played that game now.\\nI know they\u2019re fully aware that people have started to work out who they are \u2013 and they\u2019re terrified of their past behaviour undermining their fake public image. So I\u2019ve decided to utilise another well-known phrase and believe that everyone is entitled to turn over a new leaf.\\nStill, karma has a long memory and if you\u2019ve ever treated someone really badly and you\u2019ve got any sort of conscience, somewhere along the line, on a sleepless night, that\u2019s the kind of thing that will keep you awake. After all, I\u2019ve dealt with so many more nice people than those selfish horrors. In fact, I\u2019m actually starting to feel that I\u2019m doing a disservice to all the wonderful women \u2013 on screen and off \u2013 who\u2019ve stayed loyal to me and always had my back for decades by focusing on those bitches!\\nSo, when my follow-up book Guilty Women is released next year, I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m going to shine a light on the positive parts of the entertainment world, not just the bad. Because for every rotten apple there\u2019s a basketful of good ones.\\nIt may sound shallow to be talking about \u201cshowbiz, showbiz\u201d, but in reality a great portion of the world is interested in what goes on behind the velvet curtain and how the other half live. It\u2019s part of why you\u2019re reading this column now. So, while I may be promising to pull my claws in somewhat, I can guarantee you that the next round of revelations I spill certainly won\u2019t be boring.\\nOh, and did I mention I\u2019d been asked to write my autobiography?

Was he going to jilt his new love like he did to our columnist? Here's what happened next...\\nThe night passed in a sleepless blur. After sending my ex on his way, saying I needed to think, I tossed and turned until it was morning. If I had actually slept, I might have thought I\u2019d dreamt the whole scenario \u2013 that the outcome of another woman\u2019s \u2018big day\u2019 was now in my hands.  It had taken me every ounce of self-control to ask him to leave in the early hours so that nothing happened between us. After all, despite what he was saying, he was still engaged and she was the innocent party. So, there was no way I was going to betray the girl code \u2013 even though the way he kissed me goodbye showed he certainly didn\u2019t give a damn about it.  As I lay awake, my mind whirled with confusion. There was absolutely no doubt that the chemistry we\u2019d shared was still there and it was also true that I wanted him as much as I could see he wanted me. But there was also that voice in my head reminding me what he\u2019d done to me by leaving me at the altar all those years ago.\\nNow he was giving me the choice to take him back and start our lives together again, but in return I had to cause the same pain to another woman.\\nAs I\u2019d closed the door, he\u2019d told me the kids missed me. That was another kick in the teeth. When you are a step-parent, it doesn\u2019t matter how long you\u2019ve been together or how close you are to the children you help care for, if it all goes pear-shaped, blood is all that really counts.  So, as well as the loss of the future I\u2019d expected, I experienced the sorrow of knowing it was too late to have my own children. Having invested so much time and love in his kids, who I\u2019d now lost, I felt I\u2019d never be able to date anyone with children again. At my age, 45, this means I now have a very limited selection to choose from.\\nI looked at the clock. There was only an hour to go until they were due at the registry office. Almost on autopilot, I threw on some clothes, did my hair and make-up and jumped in a cab. Twenty minutes later, I kept the meter running as I sat in the back seat and watched happy couples come and go from the town hall steps. I looked in my bag for my phone but, in my rush to leave, I realised I\u2019d left it at home. I wanted to call my best friend and tell her where I was. She\u2019s always the voice of reason.\\n\u201cDamn!\u201d I said out loud, which caused the cabbie \u2013 a kindly looking older gentleman \u2013 to ask if I was alright. Before I knew what I was doing, I\u2019d poured the whole story out to him as he sat with his mouth open. I finished by telling him that, without my phone to call him, if I wanted to stop the wedding the only way was to make my way inside where I\u2019d see them face-to-face.  \u201cDo you mind if I give you my honest opinion?\u201d the driver asked in his rich Cockney tone, as he switched off the meter and turned to face me. I nodded.\\n\u201cExcuse my French, but he sounds like an absolute arsehole. Not only has he done that to you, but now he\u2019s willing to do it again to this other poor girl and this time he wants to leave the responsibility for breaking her heart at your door. I know men like this \u2013 they never change.\u201d  As he finished his speech, another taxi arrived and I saw my ex getting out of it. \u201cIs that him?\u201d he asked. I nodded. \u201cWell, you don\u2019t have listen to me \u2013 you listen to your heart, girl. It\u2019s your life. You don\u2019t have to pay either. This journey is on me. Do you want to get out or\u2026?\u201d  Before he\u2019d finished, I cut him off. \u201cNo, drive me home please.\u201d  And at exactly the same time that the driver put his foot down, my ex spotted me in the cab and our eyes met briefly as I drove away.\\nWhat would you have done?
