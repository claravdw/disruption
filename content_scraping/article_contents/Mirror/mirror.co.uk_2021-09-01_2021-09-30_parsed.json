Brown declined an offer by a member of cabin staff to help him to his seat, telling her that he was going to climb on to the roof of the plane.  Giving evidence, he wept as he told jurors: \"I was prepared to challenge myself, to be scared, to face the fear, because the fear of climate ecological breakdown is so much greater.\"\\nIn an emotional speech, married father-of-four Brown, who runs a charity, said: \"My protest, the purpose I hope is clear, my motivation was to maximise media attention to the climate crisis, which back at that time was hardly receiving any.\"\\nTim Maloney QC, defending Brown at his sentencing hearing, said: \"He has expressed an intention not to become involved in unlawful protest again.\"  Mr Maloney said Brown has \"overcome the barriers to live a successful and inspiring life\", competing at five Paralympic games and becoming a successful businessman.  \"There is so much more to his life than sporting excellence,\" he said as he described Brown's career as a maths teacher before working for Gloucestershire County council in disabled children's services.  He also built a conference centre aimed at meeting the needs of disabled people and set up Mobiloo, a company which provides facilities for disabled people at festivals and events.", "image": null, "author": null, "date": "2021-09-24"}}
