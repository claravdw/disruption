A new start is meant to be ahead of us, and I hope it is because I really feel in need of fresh beginnings.\\nIf you\u2019ve been following my column for the past few weeks, you\u2019ll know I found myself in the sort of drama I\u2019m more used to seeing my clients act out on screen. This time it was me who left him at the altar \u2013 and I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t admit that finding myself in such a dilemma over someone I thought I\u2019d moved on from has shown me that I have a lot of work to do on myself.\\nI can tell you that he did get married, and yes, I did want him to chase after me in the car as I drove off. But he didn\u2019t, and that gave me the closure I needed. Finally, I realised this was a man who didn\u2019t just want to have his cake and eat it, he wanted to own several bakeries and still try all the different varieties on offer elsewhere. Enough is enough.\\nI promise you I will never allow him to pull on any of my heartstrings again (so many of you wrote in warning me of your own stories), so you have my word \u2013 that chapter is well and truly closed.\\nI\u2019ve had my critics for this column \u2013 or trolls as we call them \u2013 saying I reveal too much for an author, and I should just stick to promoting my books or promoting my talent. But you know what, I\u2019m not perfect and I don\u2019t pretend to be. That\u2019s the beauty of being honest and showing your vulnerable side \u2013 the amount of letters from readers supporting me, advising me and asking for my opinion during this difficult time living on my own in lockdown has really kept me going.\\nI hope that reading my weekly ups and downs has given your weekends a bit of a kick too, even if it is just to shake your head at the trouble I seem to land myself in each week.\\nToday I have a bit of sad, but also exciting news. This will be my last column until the summer \u2013 I\u2019m off back to my day job. Those of you who know my writing will remember that my first book, Ruthless Women - the book I wrote during the first lockdown, that 39 publishers told me \u201cno one would ever want to read\u201d - went on to sell 200,000 copies, was translated into seven languages (none of which I speak!) and reached number 4 in the bestseller chart. It was such a success that the publishers wanted a sequel, so this year, between columns, I\u2019ve been throwing my heart and soul into writing Guilty Women.\\nThe women in my novels are all women I\u2019ve encountered in real life, and I like to think my books are a hit because people can tell I\u2019m writing from the truth. All the bitches, bastards and two-faced backstabbers that inhabit your TV screens daily are in there \u2013 just under different names.\\nAs a working-class woman from a Stockport council estate, with no official training or qualifications \u2013 just pure passion to give you readers a great story \u2013 I\u2019d love to get on that bestseller list again. I\u2019d also like to prove to all those posh snobs who want to keep us \u201cEducating Rita types\u201d away from the prizes that it wasn\u2019t a fluke!\\nSo if reading about my disastrous love life this year has given you any pleasure, I\u2019d be thrilled if you\u2019d order my books on Amazon and then come and find me on social media and tell me what you think!\\nWish me luck, I\u2019ll miss you. It\u2019s been like therapy sharing my problems with you every week and getting your feedback. Keep in touch and, who knows, by the time Guilty Women is out in April, I might even have fallen in love again.\\nAnd when I do return, I hope my little pooch Benjie is still here with me (he\u2019s 14 and not doing great). The smile on his face, despite his pain, makes me happy to have every day I can with him, so hopefully we\u2019ll both be back in the summer. Until then, stay safe.\\nMel would love you to keep in touch while she\u2019s away.
