For a woman living on a council estate with no money, the store was the epitome of glamour \u2013 a window into a world she could only dream of.\\nShe did, however, get to visit Harrods once when she won \u00a31,000 at the local bingo (which was a fortune in the 80s). She chose to spend her winnings on a trip to London to visit the store.\\nI\u2019ve still got the little Harrods teddy bear that she brought back for me, and I can remember the expression in her eyes as she told us about her trip. You could see just how much she\u2019d loved a walk in someone else\u2019s shoes during her brief escape from our meagre lifestyle.\\nAs I reached the store and took in all the beautiful Christmas-themed windows, I wished she was still alive so that I could have FaceTimed her and shown her what it looks like these days.\\nInside it was still as posh as ever, with the staff in designer outfits and the famous food hall filled with people drinking champagne while planning what they were going to buy from the floors above. Having been out of the loop for so long, it felt a bit like I was watching a goldfish bowl.\\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, this is not my first foray into the land of expensive tastes. When I was at my height as a showbiz agent, making quite frankly a fortune every year, I would think nothing of popping into a Chanel store and spending \u00a325,000 on five bags in one go. But after the global pandemic made us all reassess our priorities and the value of people over possessions, that sort of memory of extravagance and waste makes me feel sick as it\u2019s something I would never do now.\\nBefore you write me off as some sort of self-indulgent shopaholic, let me confirm for the karma banks that I actually gave four of those five bags to friends who couldn\u2019t afford to buy them. But it still doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that I\u2019ve changed a lot over the past few years \u2013 and one of the biggest changes is that I\u2019m facing my first Christmas single in over a decade.\\nAs I watched the couples weaving around the festive-themed halls and eyed them merrily stocking up on hampers, I realised that this year it would be just me. I used to have a joke with my female friends about how every year I had a different man taking down my Christmas tree and as I watched them return it to the basement in my old home I\u2019d look at their faces knowing that they were expecting to be the one bringing it back out the following year.\\nBut with me still reeling and healing from the disastrous wedding that never was, I only ever saw all those men as temporary.\\nHistorically, nobody wants to be single at Christmas and looking back I realise that I\u2019ve fallen into that trap of making sure I was always with someone for the big day. But as I left the store to make the short trip home I realised that this year I was happy to break that tradition.\\nFor the first time I don\u2019t feel the need to couple up to avoid being alone when the sleigh bells ring. I think this is a great sign of growth and makes me excited about the future \u2013 if I change my mind and want to be with someone again, then I\u2019ll know I\u2019m doing it for the right reasons.\\nI haven\u2019t completely changed though, because I couldn\u2019t leave the store without treating myself to the most fabulous Balmain dress, which could easily cover the cost of four mortgage payments. But hey, I only bought one, so that\u2019s progress, right?\\nDo you need a partner to be happy at Christmas?

But in the past few weeks my age has suddenly come to the forefront of my mind because I\u2019ve met a younger man \u2013 about a decade younger, to be precise \u2013 and believe it or not, considering the many dating tales that I\u2019ve told you on this page, I\u2019ve never actually gone out with anyone younger than me. They were always usually three to five years older, which made me the \u201cyoung one\u201d.  I\u2019m not going to go into too much detail as it's very early days and he\u2019s probably reading this, and I\u2019m not taking it too seriously because of the age gap. But this week I\u2019m going to be asking you for advice. What do you think I should do? Should I ignore the age gap or could it only lead to trouble?\\nRight now it\u2019s casual and with my schedule being so busy finishing my new book, which is out next April, there isn\u2019t much time to meet up anyway, which is keeping things at a safe distance. But as this is my first experience of an age-gap connection, I\u2019m wondering what the general consensus is?  When we are together we don\u2019t look any different in age. He works in renovation and house restoration, something I also do in my spare time (I\u2019ve flipped more houses than I have pancakes) so we have plenty in common and I don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a difference \u2013 plus, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m 45, whatever 45 feels like.\\nYet there is a niggling feeling in the back of my head. What if by some chance it was to turn into something serious and a few years down the line I was in love (which we all know is a dangerous place to be)? He could suddenly decide he wants children and to start a family \u2013 and I\u2019ve definitely missed that window. Would the devastation be worse to get over at an older age?  Say I was then 50 \u2013 would it mean that I would no longer fancy older men if I\u2019d got used to a younger one? Would I be destined to live the life of a cougar, always searching for that younger man who you could always get but probably couldn\u2019t keep?\\nI have so many questions! Looking around, there are so few older women and younger men relationships in the media that seemed to have worked. After Demi Moore married Ashton Kutcher, who was 15 years younger, she eventually found out he was cheating on her with a woman half her age and has never seemed to be romantically linked with anyone since. That\u2019s a worry, as I can only think of a handful of successes.  They include the late, great Dame Barbara Windsor and her husband Scott, 27 years apart, and ever-fabulous Joan Collins and Percy, who is 31 years her junior.  But on a positive note, just recently, the lovely Kym Marsh married Scott Ratcliff, who is 10 years younger than her, so maybe there is hope for a \u201cMay To December\u201d relationship after all.  Like I said earlier, I\u2019d really welcome your advice this week on whether it\u2019s a wise move on my part to pursue it...

It forces you to raise your own levels to try and match him.\u201d\\nIn the new series, Daniel\u2019s character also joins an Extinction Rebellion-style protest group alongside Milton\u2019s daughter Eve (Lily Newmark).\\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t done on purpose, but Lee going into climate change activism is very relatable to what is going on now, as you\u2019ve got the whole Extinction Rebellion thing kicking off and the M25 protests at the moment,\u201d says Daniel.\\n\u201cThe great arc we have with Lee at the moment is that he does start in this pretty dark place where he\u2019s completely alone, he was told to clear the bunker out and leave no trace of himself in there, but he\u2019s pretty much welded himself in there and become a bit like Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now.\\n\u201cHe\u2019s shaving his head and doing some weird stuff, and just can\u2019t leave that place because the upstairs world represents this dangerous and unpredictable place.\\n\u201cBut the journey in the second series is Lee finding his place in the world again and what helps him do this is all the climate change actions he gets involved in.\u201d\\nThe characters of Lee and Daniel Milton are a classic \u2018odd couple\u2019, and Daniel says it works because while the characters are poles apart and from different walks of life, they are \u201ccompletely and utterly co-dependent on each other and that\u2019s why it worked.\u201d\\nIn the first episode of series two, viewers saw them meeting again for the first time since the events of last season, which culminated in a shoot-out in the bunker.\\nAnd Daniel says this was the first scene of Temple that he filmed, arriving on set six weeks after filming started, as he was shooting his part as DI John Major in Sky One police comedy Code 404 right before.\\n\u201cShooting that first scene with Mark was really brilliant, because I finished that scene and was like, \u2018right, I\u2019m back in Temple now and we can take it from there\u2019.\\n\u201cIt was really weird jumping from Code 404, which is a high-end slapstick comedy to Temple. Even though Lee is a funny character, it is a different discipline. You have to play him much more serious and straight.\u201d\\nAnd coming back to Code 404 was Daniel\u2019s first time working in seven months due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.\\nWhile he initially wanted to take a break at the start of 2020 after filming Netflix show White Lines and the Dennis Nilsen drama Des, Daniel\u2019s time off was not at all relaxing.\\n\"I\u2019d had a ridiculous run of work doing White Lines and Des and loads of other stuff before that, and knew I needed to chill out for a bit and put my feet up,\u201d says Daniel.\\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t realise that was going to become seven months... and it was very stressful as my wife Lou broke her ankle in a freak accident so I was doing all the homeschooling as well as looking after her.\u201d\\nDaniel says at one point during the pandemic he even thought TV productions and theatre might never come back and he wouldn\u2019t work again - and that adjusting to life on set has been strange.\\n\u201cI had a moment where I thought it would never come back,\u201d says Daniel.\\n\u201cThankfully it did, but it was weird adjusting. When I came back to do Code 404, my colleague Stephen Graham said it was like our first ever day on set, which was exactly what it felt like.\u201d\\nHe also admits one of the things he found hardest was going to work then just coming home every day.\\n\u201cWe had to soft isolate away from the set,\u201d says Daniel. \u201cI remember on week one of Code 404, our producer said it\u2019s all about test and trace. If you go out for a pizza and give your details, somebody sitting nearby who is a complete stranger could get Covid and it could be the reason why the whole production shuts down and that kind of blew my mind.\u201d\\nDaniel was born in Epping, Essex and trained at RADA, where he graduated in 2000.\\nHis first major role was in 2002 Mike Leigh film All or Nothing, where he starred alongside Timothy Spall and Lesley Manville.\\nSince then, he has acted in several stage plays, films including Made in Dagenham and 1917 and major TV dramas including a role in the third series of Line of Duty in 2016, where he played Danny Waldron.\\nDespite the character of Danny only being in two episodes, Daniel was nominated for a BAFTA Television Award for Supporting Actor for his role.\\nAnd Daniel is about to follow fellow Line of Duty star Adrian Dunbar, who plays Ted Hastings as he is set to appear in an upcoming episode of Inside No. 9.\\nWhile he can\u2019t reveal much about the instalment itself, he says he has been begging pals Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith to cast him in it for a while.\\nHe says: \u201cI\u2019ve worked with Steve twice and him and Reece live near me, and I kept bumping into them and being like, \u2018when are you going to get me on the show?\u2019 as I\u2019m a massive fan of it but they have stayed true to their word.\\n\u201cIt was probably the most intense week\u2019s filming I\u2019ve ever done, but it was a lot of fun and it\u2019s a brilliant one-off episode.\u201d\\nDaniel says he next has his sights set on a part in the HBO series Succession, which he has been watching, and also adds that he would love to work with Vigil\u2019s Suranne Jones, who he describes as \u201cphenomenal\u201d.\\nHe adds: \u201cFor an actor, you never know what role you\u2019re going to get next. What you\u2019re going to end up with, where you\u2019re going to be shooting it. It\u2019s completely unpredictable but completely terrifying at the same time.\u201d\\nAnd for now, Daniel would be happy for Temple to return for a third series.\\n\u201cWithout giving anything away about how it ends, the climactic end to season two is just as thrilling as the first season and it leaves all avenues open,\u201d he says.\\n\u201cYou can take this show any way you want to go with it. Some of the scenes in the new series are very exciting, and to do three series of Temple would be absolutely perfect.\u201d\\n*Temple is available on Sky Max and Streaming Service NOW on Thursdays\\nHave you got a story to sh        are?
