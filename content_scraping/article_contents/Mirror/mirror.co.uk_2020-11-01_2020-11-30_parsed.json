Tell us in the comments below.\\nPrivate Bell caught up in a car bomb blast in Northern Ireland during the Troubles.\\nHe wants to make a warning about the global climate crisis and how it may lead to more armed conflicts.\\nPrivate Bell told Mirror Online: \"This government is criminally negligent and young people today will pay the price for their failure.\\n\u201cI did four tours in Northern Ireland. I have been in conflict. I saw good friends - my comrades, who I served with - die.\\n\"Many of the people who attend the Remembrance Day Service have never seen the horrors of war. I hope they never have to.\\n\u201cHowever you feel about the action today, I want people to take this message - if we don't deal with this climate emergency, now, it will lead to war.\u201d\\nThe 64-year-old, who was badly injured in a car bomb blast in Stewartstown in 1974, urged the government to pay close attention to a report published earlier this year for the Ministry of Defence.\\nIt warned of an increase unrest and conflict as global heating causes droughts and food shortages.\\n\"I took action today knowing that I would be criticised,\" he continued.\\n\"I knew that I would be accused of being disrespectful and hated by many for speaking out in this way.\\n\"Remembrance Day is never an easy time for veterans and this was not an easy decision for me to make.\\n\u201cBut I served this country, I served the people of this country and the action I took today is about just that.\\n\"Unchecked climate change means a return to a world at war. I cannot stand by and let that happen. It is my duty to act.\"\\nHe added: \"What I saw was vile and unnecessary.\\n\"I suffer with post-traumatic stress, so many ex-servicemen can't fit back into society.
