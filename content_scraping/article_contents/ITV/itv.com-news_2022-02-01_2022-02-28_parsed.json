I completely fell into the cycle of wanting to change what I looked like.\"\nDale said that he decided to get a nose job because he \"always left insecure about the size of his nose.\"\nHowever, he went on to spent thousands of pounds on other cosmetic procedures, including a chin implant and crowns on his teeth, to achieve \"the perfect look.\"\nWhile he said he does not regret the procedures, he does regret the reasons behind them.\nHe said: \"I'm happy with what I've had done. I don't regret any of the procedures I've had. The only thing that I do regret is the reasons why I had them done.\n\"I wish I had booked the procedures for my body, for my mind. At the time, I booked it because I thought that's what you were meant to look like.\"\nDale added: \"When you scroll through Instagram, you can get sucked in by a fake reality.\"\n\"I'm not going to say don't get surgery, but do it for the right reasons.\n\"If possible, try to get to the root of any issue or problem or any insecurities in yourself before you let a surgeon work on you.\"\nHe explained that the social media pressures that men feel to get cosmetic procedures is not as openly talked about.\nDale said: \"I feel like you only hear about women feeling the pressures of social media, but men feel like that as well.\n\"You think these people have been carved by angels and think 'why don't I look like that?'\"\n", "image": null, "author": null, "date": "2022-02-25", "source": "ITV", "id": "ITV_2022-02-25_Durham-man-who"}, "https://www.itv.com/news/tyne-tees/2022-02-15/explosion-in-sunderland-blows-entire-roof-off-house": {"title": "Two taken to hospital after suspected gas explosion in Sunderland blows roof off house", "subtitle": null, "text": "Two people have been taken to hospital with 'blast injuries' after a house explosion in Sunderland, with one in a critical condition.\nPolice say it is suspected a gas explosion tore the roof off the property in Roker on Tuesday afternoon.\nPhotos of severe damage at the property in Roker show its roof and part of its front missing, with bricks and debris in the street outside and the top floor exposed.\nA Northumbria Police spokesperson said: \u201cAt 3.45pm today we received a report of a suspected gas explosion at an address on Whickham Street, Sunderland.\n\u201cEmergency services are at the scene.\n\u201cTwo men have been taken to hospital with injuries that are not deemed to be life-threatening at this time.\n\u201cOfficers remain in the area alongside Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service and anyone with concerns is asked to speak to them.\u201d\nNorth East Air Ambulance Service said earlier: \"We have taken one patient to Sunderland Hospital.\"We have taken a second patient to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle.\n\"Both were treated for blast injuries.\"\nDeputy Chief Fire Officer Peter Heath, of TWFRS, said crews would remain in the area into Tuesday evening, alongside colleagues at Northumbria Police this evening to ensure the site is safe.\nHe said: \u201cThis has been a significant explosion and there has been substantial damage caused to the property in question.\n\u201cThankfully our crews were quickly on scene alongside our other blue light partners to assist two male casualties from the area and they have since been transferred to hospital.\n\u201cWe will remain in the area alongside our partners this evening to assess the site and ensure it is structurally safe.
