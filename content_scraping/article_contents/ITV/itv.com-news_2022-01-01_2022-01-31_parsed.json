He was found guilty after a jury deliberated for less than an hour.\\nLord Burnett said, in a written ruling, that people who caused major disruption at airports and were convicted of causing a public nuisance ran \"a substantial risk\" of going to prison.\\nBut he said appeal judges had considered whether a 12-month jail term was \"manifestly excessive\" in the light of Brown\u2019s conduct, antecedents and disability.\\nHe added: \"The right to peaceful protest should not lead to tolerance of behaviour that is far removed from conveying a strongly held conviction but instead seeks to cause chaos and as much harm as possible to members of the public.\"", "image": null, "author": null, "date": "2022-01-14"}}
