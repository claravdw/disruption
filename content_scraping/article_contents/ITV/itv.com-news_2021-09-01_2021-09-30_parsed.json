Exeter, spent an hour on top of the aircraft before he was removed.\\nMr Brown had booked his flight on the morning of the stunt and smuggled a bottle of superglue in his luggage that was not detected by security, prosecutor Richard Witcombe told the jury during the trial.\\nMr Brown declined an offer by a member of cabin staff to help him to his seat, telling her that he was going to climb on to the roof of the plane.\\nProsecutors said he caused disruption to more than 300 British Airways passengers, costing the airline \u00a340,000.\\nThe former Paralympian represented Great Britain in cycling and athletics before going on to represent Ireland in cross-country skiing.\\nMr Brown, who represented himself at his trial, denied one count of causing a public nuisance, claiming he had \u201cto do something spectacular\u201d to draw attention to the climate crisis.\\nBut he was found guilty at Southwark Crown Court in July after a jury deliberated for less than an hour.\\nJudge Gregory Perrins sentenced him to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment, of which he will serve half, on Friday.\\nHe told Brown: \u201cThe right to protest does not entitle you to cause major widespread

\u201caccomplished athlete\u201d Brown: \u201cYou cynically used your disability to put your plan into action\u201d, adding: \u201cYou put your own life at risk by climbing on top of the

environment.\\nGiving evidence, Mr Brown wept as he told jurors: \u201cI was prepared to challenge myself, to be scared, to face the fear, because the fear of climate ecological breakdown is so much greater.\"\\nIn an emotional speech, married father-of-four Brown, who runs a charity, said: \"My protest, the purpose I hope is clear, my motivation was to maximise media attention to the climate

And I would strongly urge the people involved in it not to put themselves and others at harm by this continued disruption.\u201d\\n\u201cThese protesters are waking up at lunchtime and claiming credit for the sunrise.
