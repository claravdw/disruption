Similar protests have taken place at Barclays sites across the UK.\\nExtinction Rebellion says that this is an unacceptable relationship as the bank invests its profits into financing the fossil fuel industry.\\nDemonstrators say that it leaves taxpayers \"no choice but to be complicit in environmental exploitation without their consent or knowledge\".\\nA number of activists sat in the road leading up to the entrance of the HMRC building with colourful flags and placards around their necks.\\nNorthumbria Police confirmed they received a report of a small group of protestors outside HMRC, shortly before 7:40am.
