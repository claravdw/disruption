This is not to mention the catastrophic and accelerating impact decisions like this have on climate change.\\n\"On the issue of the local impact, the facts are indisputable.\u00a0 As a result of the expansion, 46,000 people will be subjected to levels of noise considered by the World Health Organisation to be bad for physical and mental health.\"\\nWith regards to noise and environmental issues, the airport say it wants to work with residents to 'mitigate these issues going forwards'.\\nNew vehicle charges to be introduced at Gatwick's south terminal\\n", "image": null, "author": null, "date": "2021-04-11"}}
