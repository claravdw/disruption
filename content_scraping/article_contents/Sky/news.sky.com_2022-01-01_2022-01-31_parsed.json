The Sue Gray report reveals minimal details about them, but does reveal which other four events are not being probed by detectives.", "text": "With Sue Gray unable to publish a \"meaningful report\" on her investigation\u00a0into alleged COVID breaches inside Downing Street, all eyes are back\u00a0on the Met Police's probe of Number 10 parties.\\nIn the report published on Monday, Ms Gray said the Met's request for \"minimal reference\" to the events they are looking at means she is currently \"extremely limited\" in what she can say about what happened.\\nThe senior civil servant did reveal, however, that she has investigated 16 gatherings over a 20-month period - and that police are looking into 12 of them.\\nProminent Tory MPs turn on Boris Johnson; follow live politics updates\\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\\n\\nThe remaining four \"are not considered to have reached the threshold for criminal investigation\".\\nAnnouncing the inquiry, Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said the force decided to investigate in light of \"deep public concern\" about the party allegations and after evidence was handed to them by the Cabinet Office.\\nWhat did the Sue Gray report say?\\nAccording to the terms of reference of the Gray inquiry, it could have been \"paused\" for potentially-criminal behaviour to be investigated by the police.\\nBut Ms Gray said that \"given the widespread public interest in, and concern about\" the allegations she decided to \"provide an update\" with some \"general findings\" now - ahead of the police probe finishing.\\nIn it she lists the 16 events she looked at, but provides very minimal details. All except four of them are also being investigated by the Met, she confirms.\\nShe says that some of the events \"should not have been allowed to take place\" or \"develop as they did\" and that they represent a \"serious failure\" on behalf of the government.\\nWhat's in the Sue Gray report?\\n\"There were failures of leadership and judgment by different parts of No 10 and the Cabinet Office at different times,\" she writes.\\nMs Gray also criticises the \"excessive consumption of alcohol\" inside Downing Street and Whitehall as \"inappropriate\" and said that some staff had felt \"unable\" to report concerns they had about behaviour inside Number 10.\\nShe says that \"fragmented\" and \"complicated\" leadership structures need to be addressed \"as a matter of priority\" as they have \"led to the blurring of lines of accountability\".\\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\\n\\nWhy is the Met now investigating?\\nThe police decided to investigate on 23 January, according to The Times, after receiving evidence from Sue Gray's Cabinet Office team of potential criminal breaches.\\nDame Cressida explained that although police guidance has been to not investigate potential COVID breaches \"long after they are said to have taken place\", three key criteria for those \"serious\" and \"most flagrant\" allegations that should be probed had been met.\\nThey are:\\n\u2022 evidence that those involved knew or ought to have known they were committing an offence\\n\u2022 that by not investigating it would significantly undermine the legitimacy of the law\\n\u2022 that there is little ambiguity over the absence of any reasonable defence\\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\\n\\nWho is leading it?\\nThe Met inquiry is being carried out by detectives from the force's Special Enquiries Team, which specialises in sensitive cases and is being overseen by senior management.\\nIt is being led by Jane Connors, the force's deputy assistant commissioner and lead for COVID enforcement.\\nA Scotland Yard source described her to the Telegraph as the \"epitome of no nonsense\".\\nShe played a key role in the strategic response to the 2017 Westminster terror attack and has been in charge of handling the Extinction Rebellion protests that have crippled parts of London.\\nHow is it different to the Gray inquiry?\\nThe police have much wider-reaching powers than Sue Gray and the Cabinet Office.\\nOn 28 January 2022 the Met revealed they had asked that \"minimal reference\" be made in the Gray report to any events it is planning to investigate.\\nThis left Ms Gray unable to provide any substantial details about specific parties or events and reduced her \"update\" to a basic list of gatherings she looked at.\\nLegal experts have questioned the police's decision, claiming there is no risk of the Gray report prejudicing their case - as any potential criminal charge would not likely be serious enough to warrant a jury trial.\\nReports have claimed that some staff were reluctant to co-operate with Sue Gray.\\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\\n\\nAlthough she said she conducted interviews with 70 people and looked at emails, WhatsApp messages, photographs, building entry logs and official records, the police can force people to submit phone records and any other relevant material in a way an internal government inquiry cannot.\\nThe Met will likely interview both potential organisers and guests of any events, although they can still answer \"no comment\".\\nDetectives already have access to CCTV footage from outside Downing Street and other government buildings and any notes or reports made by protection officers guarding them.\\nBut they could ask for further footage to track people's movements.\\nWhat could the punishment be?\\nThe Coronavirus Act 2020 meant police could issue fixed penalty notices (FPNs) to anyone breaking the rules.\\nInitially this meant a \u00a360 fine, doubling each time for repeat offences. People had 28 days to pay or they risked being arrested or summoned to court.\\nOn 13 May 2020, this was increased to \u00a3100 and in September to \u00a3200 - reduced to \u00a3100 if paid within 14 days, and doubling up to \u00a36,400 for repeat offences.\\nIn August 2020 the law also changed so that organisers of large events of 30 people or more could be fined up to \u00a310,000.\\nThose who attended gatherings of at least 15 people risked an \u00a3800 maximum fine.\\nHuman rights barrister Adam Wagner told Sky News that any potential fine will depend on what the law was at the time of an alleged offence.\\nHe added that officials could also be prosecuted for misconduct in public office - not just under the COVID act - \"if their conduct was in breach of public trust and was serious enough\".\\nBut legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg said that being a common law offence, prosecution guidance on misconduct in public office is \"terribly vague and unclear\".\\nWhat will it cover?\\nAlthough Dame Cressida refused to reveal which events are being covered in the investigation, Sue Gray's report reveals the 12 they are investigating and the four they decided \"did not reach the threshold for criminal investigation\".\\nHere we look at which events the Met investigation is covering and what the rules were at the time.\\n20 May 2020\\nAn email obtained by ITV News showed that the PM's principal private secretary Martin Reynolds emailed staff on 20 May 2020 inviting them to \"some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden\" that evening.\\nIt read: \"Hi all, after what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening. Please join us from 6pm and bring your own booze!\"\\nMr Johnson admitted he attended the drinks at around 6pm and stayed for 25 minutes to thank staff - 40 of which are believed to have been there.\\nHe later said he \"believed implicitly\" it was a work event.\\nWhat were the rules?\\nPeople were only allowed to meet one other person outside - as long as social distancing was maintained, with \u00a3100 fines doubling for repeat offences.\\nOn 20 May 2020 a man named Nuradeem Mohammad was stopped by police in Ealing Road, west London, for \"being in a gathering of over two people without reasonable excuse\", court documents reveal.\\nThe 28-year-old was fined \u00a3100 and made to pay \u00a3134 court costs, the Evening Standard reported.\\n18 June 2020\\nThe Sue Gray report listed \"a gathering in the Cabinet Office, 70 Whitehall on the departure of a No 10 private secretary\" that happened on 18 June 2020.\\nNo details have been published in the media about such a gathering.\\nThe Met has decided it meets the threshold to form part of the investigation, however, so details may be released when the force publishes its findings.\\nWhat were the rules?\\nFrom 1 June 2020 groups of six people were allowed to meet outdoors, including in private gardens, providing they maintained social distancing of two metres.\\n19 June 2020\\nThe prime minister celebrated his birthday inside the Cabinet Room at Number 10, according to ITV News.\\nHis wife Carrie Johnson is alleged to have brought him a cake and other members of staff were there to sing him happy birthday.\\nThe broadcaster also claims family friends of the PM were hosted upstairs at Downing Street.\\nNumber 10 has said the reports are \"totally untrue\" and that staff gathered for 10 minutes to wish the PM a happy birthday in the afternoon and in the evening a small number of friends were hosted in the garden \"in line with the rules\".\\nWhat were the rules?\\nThe same rules on groups of six only being allowed to meet outside and socially-distanced applied on this date.\\n13 November 2020\\nAfter Mr Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings was seen leaving Downing Street with a box of his belongings, he said a party was held inside the Downing Street flat where the PM and his wife Carrie live.\\nNumber 10 denied this.\\nThe Times reported separately that Mr Johnson gave a leaving speech for his outgoing head of communications Lee Cain. The Met is reporting both incidents.\\nWhat were the rules?\\nEngland was in its second national lockdown between 5 November and 2 December.\\nPeople were not allowed to leave home unless for essential reasons - and they were only allowed to meet one other person from outside their household to socialise - as long as it was outdoors and not in a private garden.\\nOn 31 August, rules were brought in that could see people fined \u00a310,000 for organising or facilitating large gatherings of more than 30 people.\\nParticipating in a gathering of more than 15 people also carried maximum fines of \u00a3800.\\nOn 24 September the on-the-spot fine for single COVID breaches was also increased to \u00a3200, decreasing to \u00a3100 if paid within 14 days.\\nIn November in Rubery, Worcestershire, a woman called Andrea Lloyd was fined \u00a3200 by West Mercia Police when her ex-partner dropped off their son at her home.\\nShe was taken to court for refusing to pay the fine, but the case was later dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service.\\n17 December 2020\\nA virtual quiz was held in the private office of Cabinet Secretary Simon Case. He did not take part but is thought to have walked in at one point, so knew it was happening.\\nSky News understands the event was referred to as \"Christmas Party\" in e-calendars and involved six people on the rota in the office and six at home. It allegedly lasted an hour and included drinks and snacks.\\nSimon Case had to be replaced by Sue Gray in leading the inquiry into Downing Street parties after the story emerged.\\nSeparately that evening then director-general of the COVID Taskforce Kate Josephs admitted to hosting \"drinks in our office in the Cabinet Office to mark my leaving the civil service\".\\nIt was also reported that the prime minister made a speech at some leaving drinks for his defence aide Captain Steve Higham at some point in December 2020.\\nThe date of the event was never confirmed and the Ministry of Defence declined to comment, but it could have taken place on 17 December as Sue Gray's report said the Met is investigating \"a gathering in No 10 Downing Street on the departure of a No 10 official\" on that day.\\nAll three incidents are being probed separately by detectives.\\nWhat were the rules?\\nOn 17 December, London moved into Tier 3 COVID restrictions.\\nThis meant all pubs, bars and restaurants being closed except for takeaways, drive-throughs or deliveries.\\nGroups of six could meet outside - but not in private gardens - and all indoor mixing of households was banned.\\n18 December 2020\\nAround 40 staff are reported to have had a cheese and wine evening inside Downing Street, with Secret Santa gifts exchanged and awards handed out by director of communications Jack Doyle.\\nPeople stayed until 2am, Sky News understands.\\nFormer adviser to Boris Johnson Allegra Stratton was forced to resign after being caught on camera joking about the event at a fake press conference.\\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\\n\\nWhat were the rules?\\nLondon was still in Tier 3 restrictions.\\n14 January 2021\\nThe Sue Gray report refers to a \"gathering in No 10 Downing Street on the departure of two No 10 private secretaries\".\\nBoth she and the Met are investigating that event, but no details of it have appeared so far.\\nThey are likely to be published when the Met reveals its findings.\\nWhat were the rules?\\nEngland was in its third national lockdown from 4 January 2021.\\nPeople were expected to stay at home apart from to shop, exercise, attend medical appointments or provide care for someone.\\nThey were allowed to meet one person from outside their household if it was for exercise.\\nThat month Derbyshire Police were criticised for fining two women \u00a3200 each for travelling to a beauty spot for a walk around five miles from their home.\\n16 April 2021\\nTwo gatherings were held inside Downing Street on the eve of Prince Philip's funeral, the Daily Telegraph reported.\\nThey were held in different parts of the complex, but joined up later in the evening, each with around 30 guests, sources said.\\nThe first was a leaving party for the PM's outgoing director of communications James Slack.\\nAnd the second was reportedly for a departing Downing Street photographer, attended mainly by younger members of staff in the basement.\\nThe newspaper said that drinking and dancing went on until at least midnight, with one person sent to the Co-op on the Strand with a suitcase to fill with alcohol.\\nFollowing the reports, an apology was made to the Queen and a Number 10 spokesman said the PM was not in Downing Street on the day of the events.\\n\"It is deeply regrettable that this took place at a time of national mourning and Number 10 has apologised to the Palace,\" the PM's spokesperson said.\\nWhat were the rules?\\nIndoor socialising with other households was banned.\\nPeople were allowed to meet with a group of six people or two households outside.\\nPubs and restaurants were open but could only serve customers outdoors.\\nFines of up to \u00a310,000 for large gatherings of more than 30 people were still being imposed.\\nOn the Isle of Man on 25 April 2021, a man named Sam Culshaw was arrested and fined \u00a31,000 for being in a car with someone not in his household.\\nThe 21-year-old told a court he had picked up his girlfriend so they could go for a dog walk.\\nWhich events aren't the Met investigating?\\nThe following events \"are not considered to have reached the threshold for criminal investigation\":\\n15 May 2020\\nA photo published by The Guardian showed Boris Johnson, his wife Carrie, principal private secretary Martin Reynolds and then-special adviser Dominic Cummings in the Downing Street garden.\\nFormer health secretary Matt Hancock was also reported to be there, alongside around 20 other staff.\\nSources claim they drank wine and ate food and the prime minister was there for 15 minutes when he said his colleagues deserved a drink for \"beating back coronavirus\".\\n27 November 2020\\nDuring the second national lockdown, a leaving party was reported to have taken place for Cleo Watson, a former aide of Dominic Cummings.\\nThe prime minister is said to have made a speech.\\n10 December 2020\\nPermanent Secretary at the Department for Education Susan Acland-Hood confirmed to MPs that a Christmas party was held there which was also attended by then-education secretary Gavin Williamson.\\nThe story was first reported by the Daily Mirror.\\n15 December 2020\\nA photo published by the Sunday Mirror showed Boris Johnson taking part in an online Downing Street Christmas Zoom quiz.\\nHe was flanked by colleagues and staff were reported to have huddled around computers in various groups around Downing Street.\\nThe newspaper claimed alcohol was consumed during the quiz, which was hosted by the PM for between 10 and 15 minutes.", "image": [[null, "https://e3.365dm.com/22/01/768x432/skynews-covid-graphic-graphic_5652092.jpg?20220125124756"], ["Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Jane Connors\n        ", "https://e3.365dm.com/22/01/768x432/skynews-jane-connors-met-police_5652963.jpg?20220126103815"], ["A police officer reminds people of COVID rules in Brighton in May 2020\n        ", "https://e3.365dm.com/22/01/768x432/skynews-covid-coronavirus-covid_5652249.jpg?20220125151153"], ["Principal Private Secretary to Boris Johnson, Martin Reynolds.
