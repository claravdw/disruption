Here Sky News looks at six of them.\\nThe average carnivore diet produces 7.2kg of carbon dioxide a day, almost twice as much as a vegan diet.\\nLivestock is responsible for around 15% of world emissions and, according to researchers at the University of Oxford, adopting a vegan diet is one of the best ways to reduce your impact on the environment.\\nResearcher Joseph Poore says that by freeing up farmland to grow more trees, worldwide veganism would reduce greenhouse gases by 13 million tonnes over 20 years, which would amount to a 25% cut in global emissions.\\nProfessor Bill Collins, one of the lead authors of the UN report, told Sky News that 0.5C of the warming we have seen in recent years is caused by methane from cows.\\n\"That's really difficult to reduce without changing our diets,\" he said.\\nBut by lowering methane levels we can not only stop the planet getting hotter, we can actively lower global temperatures, he added.\\nIf you are not able to cut out meat completely, chicken production produces around a third of the CO2 per kilogram of protein than beef and lamb.\\nSo swapping red meat for poultry or cutting out dairy products will still make a difference.\\nThe coronavirus pandemic proved just how much vehicle pollution adds to our carbon footprint.\\nDuring various lockdowns in 2020, UK greenhouse gas emissions fell by 8.9% - from 454.8 million tonnes in 2019 to 414.1 million - the biggest drop since records began in 1990.\\nTransport accounts for around a third of total emissions in Britain and toxic fumes from cars, vans and lorries cause thousands of premature deaths every year.\\nSo opting for public transport or car-sharing to get around will help lower your carbon footprint considerably.\\nThe government is banning any new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, but before then, if you're able to travel by electric bus or tram - or have your own electric car - this is the best option for the planet.\\nOverall greenhouse gases also fell as a result of air travel being ground to a halt during the pandemic.\\nThe aviation industry is responsible for 2% of all human-induced CO2 emissions, according to the Air Transport Action Group.\\nBut while reducing unnecessary air travel will make a difference, climate campaign group Possible claims that a small minority of frequent flyers are the ones causing the real damage.\\nThey say 70% of all flights in the UK are taken up by the same 15% of people, with the vast majority on higher incomes.\\nAs a result, they want a frequent flyer levy introduced to deter people who can afford to fly more often from doing so.\\nProfessor Collins explains that while you can electrify cars, you can't do the same with planes. So the only way to reduce emissions from air travel is to fly less often.\\nFrom Greta Thunberg to Extinction Rebellion, climate change activists have used social media to make their campaigns go global.\\nBut you don't need to be part of a group to advocate for climate change.\\nIn terms of what to share on your social media channels, Professor Collins told Sky News: \"It's helpful to point out the consequences of climate change.\\n\"The fires that we're seeing in Greece, the floods in Germany.\\n\"It's important to show people that climate change isn't just some abstract notion, these extreme weather events are literally killing people.\"\\nOur taste for fast, cheap and disposable fashion is hurting the environment.\\nThe textile industry requires a huge quantity of water and dozens of toxic chemicals, resulting in vast amounts of water and air pollution.\\nThis year it was revealed that the UK buys more clothes than any other country in Europe.\\nAnd campaigners Fashion Revolution have also criticised big brands for failing to declare their carbon footprints, meaning many are going unchecked.\\nWhile that is up to them, there are a number of things you can do to limit the impact of your fashion choices.\\nBuying clothes second hand, selling or repurposing those you no longer want, and limiting how often you buy new items will all help.\\nAvoiding fast-delivery options will also help reduce the clothing company's carbon footprint and doing your research on which brands are more sustainable - for example ones that use electric delivery vans or produce their clothes in the UK - is another way to take action.\\nAlthough it is often pushed as the best thing you can do to help the planet, recycling has its own environmental implications.\\nTransporting and processing waste for recycling requires a lot of energy, which means higher CO2 emissions.\\nA previous Sky News Dirty Business report found thousands of tonnes of British recycling is shipped around the world only to end up in landfill.\\nSo before you recycle, look to see if you can reduce and reuse first.\\nThis means, reducing the amount of single-use plastic products you buy and focusing on items that you can reuse before you put them in the recycling bin.\\nReusable coffee cups, water bottles and carrier bags are all good examples, as well as \"upcycling\" unwanted goods.\\nAccording to Greenpeace UK just 20 fossil fuels companies are responsible for a third of all our greenhouse gas emissions put together.\\nSo while cutting out meat and single-use plastic helps on an individual level, the government and big businesses are the ones that can make bigger changes faster.\\nHead of climate at Greenpeace UK Kate Blagojevic told Sky News: \"As well as cutting down on meat and flying, anyone wishing to make a difference might want to consider getting involved in campaigns that put pressure on governments and big polluters to act.\\n\"Small steps from individuals are all well and good, but what we desperately need right now are big steps from business and political leaders.\"\\nJoining environmental campaign groups, charities and protests will remind those in power of their responsibilities for the climate.\\nOn top of the government's pledge to get to zero net emissions by 2050, around three quarters of local councils in the UK have \"declared a climate emergency\".\\nThis commits their areas to making environmental changes at local level and lobbying the government to honour their promise.\\nYou can write

refinery in Hampshire, the group has said.\\nExtinction Rebellion used their pink boat - the Beverly Geronimo - to blockade the main entrance to the Fawley ExxonMobil refinery, while other protesters cut through the site's electric fence and climbed two 50ft oil silos, the group said in a statement.\\nThe protesters, who include Olympic sailor Laura Baldwin and gold medal-winning canoeist Etienne Stott, are demanding the government stops all fossil fuel investments and are also calling for ExxonMobil to stop its expansion plans for the Fawley refinery.\\nExxonMobil is a subsidiary of oil giant Esso and its Fawley site is the largest in the UK, supplying 20% of UK fossil fuels, according to XR.\\nExtinction Rebellion said 15 activists had gained access to the site early this morning and had \"locked on\" to structures.\\nSeven of them has climbed the silos and unfurled two banners, one saying \"climate emergency\" and the other \"no future in fossil fuels\".\\nThe two Olympians are chained to the boat, with Ms Baldwin saying she is a \"deeply protective mother, moved to direct action in a desperate bid to force this suicidal system to change\".\\n\"Watching the news this summer was horrifying and heartbreaking, witnessing catastrophic climate impacts killing people on every continent of the globe,\" she added.\\nMr Scott said: \"I think it's totally wrong that oil companies continue to put their profits ahead of everyone's right to a future on a living planet.\"\\nThe protests come three days ahead of the COP26 UN climate conference in Glasgow, where members of XR offshoot group Ocean Rebellion staged another protest yesterday.\\nA campaigner dressed as Prime Minister Boris Johnson set fire to a prop boat with the words 'your children's future' written on it outside the conference venue on Wednesday.\\nOR members, including an 'oilhead' character with a petrol can mask, also burned stacks of fake money during the protest on the banks of the River Clyde.\\nPolice announced today they have charged four Animal Rebellion activists - a separate offshoot of XR - with aggravated trespass after they scaled the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs building in London on Tuesday.\\nOrla Coghlan, 26, Jamie Ozden, 25, of Tottenham, north London, were bailed to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on 15 November, alongside Liam
