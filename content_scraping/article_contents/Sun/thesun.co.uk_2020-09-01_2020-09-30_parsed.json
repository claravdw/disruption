remain kind of sane. Or at least no more insane than usual.\\nA whole bunch of new restrictions have been wheeled in.\\n\u26a0\ufe0f Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news & updates\\nThey seem to have been dreamed up by people who can\u2019t tell their ar*e from their elbow.\\nSo I can still go to the pub with my mates. But only until ten o\u2019clock.\\nThat\u2019s because before ten o\u2019clock the Covid virus is entirely harmless. It\u2019s like a pet hamster. You can pet it, feed it bits of carrot, and it won\u2019t do you any harm.\\nBut after ten o\u2019clock it apparently turns into a snarling, rampaging beast which will kill everybody. Just like a mogwai in that film Gremlins.\\nWhen I\u2019m down the pub I can mingle with the other 120 people who are also down the pub.\\nBut with the wife and kid at home I can have only a maximum of three people over to my house in case we spread the virus.\\nI must wear a mask on public transport and maybe in future in restaurants. I suppose you can suck up the soup through the material.\\nThis is despite the fact that we were told, at the height of the pandemic, that masks were useless.\\nI don\u2019t have to wear a mask in the supermarket queue outside, where I\u2019m standing with 30 other people. But I do have to wear one in the shop itself, when I\u2019m by myself in the aisle marked \u201ccheap alcohol\u201d.\\nIf I want to protest with the Black Lives Matter crew I can do so without being arrested. Same thing with the Extinction Rebellion mob.\\nBut if I want to protest about these patently stupid new restrictions I\u2019ll get hammered with a massive fine.\\nA couple of months ago we were told to go out. To pubs, restaurants and the like.\\nWe were even bribed by the \u00adGovernment to do this. Go on, they said, fill yer boots. Now we\u2019re being told to stay in.\\nA couple of months ago we were told to get back to work.\\nNo more home-working. Now we\u2019re being told to work from home again. And not to use public transport.\\nWe\u2019re over the worst of it, the Prime Minister said at the end of June. Way too early, Boris, way too early.\\nAnd telling us all to go out and buy stuff was seriously stupid.\\nNow we\u2019re likely to have troops on the streets. As if we were a banana republic or some old communist-bloc country.\\nNone of this works. The rules lack logic and rationality. The public is confused, and has every right to be confused.\\nThere is no consistent message coming from our Government.\\nAnd that, I suspect, is because the \u00adGovernment doesn\u2019t have the slightest clue what it is doing.\\nAs ever with Boris, he wants his cake and to eat it too. An economic recovery but no more Covid. You can\u2019t have both, mate.\\nAnd treading a middle way between economic recovery and reducing the spread of the infection will not work.\\nWe\u2019ll have a new lockdown as a consequence very soon.\\nThe sensible thing would be to protect the elderly and \u00advulnerable. And let \u00adeveryone else go about their business as normal.\\nBut the words \u201csensible\u201d and \u201cBoris\u201d no longer belong on the same page.\\nA BUNCH of slebs decided to boycott social media site Instagram.\\nThey insist it isn\u2019t doing enough to combat \u201chate speech\u201d.\\nThe gang included model Cara Delevingne and the reliably doolally actress Gwyneth Paltrow.\\nBut they were back on Instagram the next day.\\nFlogging their products and bigging themselves up. There\u2019s hypocrisy, and then there\u2019s Celebrity Hypocrisy.\\nDRUG-using maniac Adam Russell decided to murder as many people as possible at Gatwick airport.\\nHe was intent on a \u201cmassacre\u201d. He set off with a big knife. Only eagle-eyed security staff stopped the bloodshed.\\nRussell was eventually Tasered by the cops. What was his sentence? A 15-month suspended sentence.\\nPlus more treatment for his schizophrenia. And a gentle warning not to do it again.\\nJIM Murray is a writer and a whisky expert.\\nEvery year he compiles The Whisky Bible, easily the trade\u2019s most popular and important guide to tasting Scotch.\\nBut now he\u2019s fallen foul of the woke brigade.\\nAnother whisky writer, Becky Paskin, has complained about Murray\u2019s language. She says he is sexist.\\nThis is because Murray sometimes jokingly compares drinking whisky to making love.\\nAs someone who couldn\u2019t tell a Glenmorangie from a bowl of oxtail soup, I can\u2019t comment on the specifics.\\nAll I can say is that whisky leaves me with a bad headache and a weird taste in the mouth.\\nSo not that dissimilar to love-making, so far as I can remember. But, anyway, Paskin whipped up a campaign.\\nAnd now leading brands, scared of the onslaught, have decided to have nothing more to do with Jim.\\nThe grim and humourless Paskin is triumphant. Doubly triumphant, as she is reportedly preparing to launch her own whisky bible. And Murray will be left without a business.\\nThis is the way the woke legions work. Scaring weak-minded companies, and bullying people. And destroying their lives.\\nTHE quiet Bedfordshire town has been hit by four earthquakes in two weeks. Including two in ONE DAY.\\nOK, at the moment they\u2019re not quite the sort of earthquakes you get in San Francisco.\\nBut still, who knows what might happen next? A huge, fiery fissure might appear in the earth on the High Street.\\nAnd out of it will then pour Satan\u2019s infernal imps, cackling and being evil.\\nI suspect it is the strain of being situated halfway between Milton Keynes and Luton. The town secretly wishes to be swallowed up.\\nSEEMINGLY every day President Donald Trump is handed a magnificent gift by his political opponents.\\nThe latest is Prince Harry and Meghan telling everyone they\u2019ve got to vote Democrat. In not so many words.\\nYou can imagine how that\u2019s going to go down in the blue-collar swing states? Places like Ohio and Wisconsin.\\n\u201cHey Bubba\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Prince Harry says we ought to ditch Trump.\u201d\\n\u201cWho the hell is Prince Harry?\u201d\\n\u201cBearded ginger halfwit from limeyland.

This is the greatest gift to Trump and the Republicans since the Guardian got famous liberal British tossers to write to US voters, urging them to vote Democrat.\\nUS cities are still burning on account of those \u201clargely peaceful\u201d Black Lives Matter protests.\\nIn Minneapolis, violent crime surged when the city decided to stop funding the police.\\nSurprise, huh?\\nNow there\u2019s vigilantes armed with rifles patrolling the city.\\nOrdinary Americans look at this with horror. And will vote for Trump.\\nI WENT to my local Sainsbury\u2019s. Nobody queuing to get in.\\nSo I stood three metres from the entrance, masked up and waited to be allowed in by the bloke in charge of admission.\\n\u201cGet behind the line,\u201d he shouted at me. I looked. There was indeed a sticky-tape line four inches behind where I was standing. \u201cBut there\u2019s nobody else here,\u201d I protested.\\n\u201cStop whingeing and get behind the bloody line NOW,\u201d he barked.\\n\\nCovid.
