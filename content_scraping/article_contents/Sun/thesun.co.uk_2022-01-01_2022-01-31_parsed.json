He has taken some knocks.\\nBut the thing about this Prime Minister is that he never stays on the ropes for long.\\nThe pandemic knocked us all for six.\\nBut thanks to the decisions this PM made, we were the first nation in the world to deliver a vaccine \u2014 and the fastest in Europe to roll it out.\\nWe are now the most tested country in Europe and we have secured more antiviral drugs than any country in Europe too, saving lives with our investment in cutting-edge treatments.\\nBecause our vaccine success has now charted a path out of Covid, we have also been able to open our economy more quickly than anywhere else on the Continent.\\nSo much so, we have the fastest-growing economy in the G7.\\nSo let\u2019s get some perspective.\\nIf Sir Keir Starmer had been in charge, we would still be cowering in the corner, too afraid to lift lockdown restrictions and too scared to resume normal life.\\nWe would have been poorer and less free.\\nAnd if the Liberal Democrats were in charge, they would have had us stuck in the European Union with our hands pinned to our sides, blocked from getting our own supply of vaccines.\\nThe last people you want in charge of our precious country is that bunch of lightweights.\\nIn taking the big decisions \u2014 on the pandemic and on Brexit \u2014 the PM showed he is a heavyweight who will stand up for Britain.\\nHe is taking the fight to criminals too.\\nAs part of our crime-fighting package we are hiring 20,000 more police officers, passing into law longer jail times for dangerous sexual and violent offenders and those evil enough to abuse children.\\nWe are increasing the sentences for those who harm our brave police officers and paramedics on the front line because we feel duty bound to stand up for those who work tirelessly to keep us safe.\\nLabour, meanwhile, opposed our tougher sentences and our plans to hire more cops.\\nUltimately, this comes down to strength of character and leadership.\\nWe have a proud tradition of freedom and peaceful protest in Britain.\\nBut those clogging up our motorways, such as Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion, are engaged in outright sabotage, stopping people getting to work, preventing ambulances getting to the injured and sick.\\nThe PM has proposed legislation to stop these guerrilla tactics because he is on the side of the law-abiding majority.\\nKeir Starmer and the Lib Dems caved into the lobby groups and voted to keep the ambulance-blockers blighting our roads.\\nThey are weak on crime and lack the backbone to stand up for the British people, who don\u2019t want militants putting lives and livelihoods at risk.\\nSo, no, it has not been an easy few weeks.\\nThe culture in No\u200a10 needs to be addressed to meet the standards the public rightly expect.\\nBut never forget this Prime Minister is in your corner and will always stand up for the people.\\nFrom recruiting more police to busting the NHS backlog; from fixing social care to securing higher-paid jobs; from creating more prison places to seizing the benefits of Brexit; this Government is going hell for leather to deliver on the people\u2019s priorities.\\nThe PM made the tough decisions to get us through the pandemic.\\nThe economy is firing on all cylinders and violent crime has fallen 44 per cent since Labour was in office.\\nNo one doubts he has gone through some tough rounds lately.\\n\\nYet, like a seasoned prize-fighter, every time the bell rings, this Prime Minister comes out swinging.", "image": [["Boris Johnson never stays on the ropes for long - here we imagine the PM in the boxing ring", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ROB-GRAPHIC-P12-BORIS.jpg?strip=all&w=915"], ["Dominic Raab is Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/e06004f8-9fc1-4794-bda3-f1fdff15f8c3.jpg?strip=all&w=960"]], "author": ["Dominic Raab, Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary"], "date": "2022-01-22"}}
