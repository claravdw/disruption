Protest yes but don\u2019t destroy our heritage. You\u2019ll just lose support.\"\\nAnother added: \"Can you protest in a less selfish way? Disrupting and annoying the general public is at best foolish.\"\\nWhile a third fumed: \"Unbelievably reckless. The wrong target. ART is not the target. It\u2019s so poorly judged. It sets back the net zero and climate debate by alienating the public. Art is not a legitimate target. This is childish, destructive and naive.\"\\nIn a statement, Hunt later said \"the disruption will end when the UK Government makes a meaningful statement that it will end new oil and gas licences\".\\nIt comes as five men, aged between 21 and 46, and two women, aged 20 and 44, were arrested after a track invasion on the opening lap of the race at Silverstone.\\nThe incident was not shown on F1's global television feed, but eyewitness footage emerged of five people - understood to be representing JSO - entering the circuit at the high-speed Wellington Straight.\\nThey then sat down on the tarmac.\\nFive JSO members are also said to have attached themselves to a 19th-century landscape by Horatio McCulloch called My Heart's In The Highlands which hangs in Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum.\\nThey are also alleged to have sprayed the group's logo on the walls and floor of the renowned gallery in orange paint.", "image": [["Protesters from Just Stop Oil climate protest group, glue their hands to the frame of John Constable\u2019s The Hay Wain", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000744908403.jpg?strip=all&w=960"], ["They first covered the painting with their own picture inside the National Gallery, London", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000744907235.jpg?strip=all&w=960"], ["Eben Lazarus, 22, and Hannah Hunt, 23, were both arrested", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000744908426.jpg?strip=all&w=960"]], "author": ["Sarah Grealish"], "date": "2022-07-04"}}
