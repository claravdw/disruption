And so you've taken away the things that might keep people on the straight and narrow.\u201d\\nDomestic killings have also been on the rise during lockdown, as figures \u00a0from the Met show there were 22 domestic homicides in 2020, up from 16 in 2019, with 12 children being killed in 2020 and seven in 2019.\\nCops last night were also investigating two separate stabbings which left two teenagers fighting for their lives \u00a0within an hour of the separate incidents.\\nA 16-year-old boy was rushed to hospital, where he remains in a serious but stable condition, after being attacked in broad daylight in Brixton.\\nA second incident in Newham forty minutes later left a 19-year-old also in a critical condition after being stabbed.\\nRomario Opia, 15, \u00a0became the capital's youngest victim after he was knifed to death on the way to a fish and chips shop on January 25.\\nDrekwon Patterson, 16, \u00a0is this year\u2019s second youngest victim and was stabbed to death after thugs drove a car at him in Wembley, North West London, at 11.30pm on February 18.\\nMayor of London Sadiq Khan has announced plans to have officers stationed outside of London schools in an attempt to curb the violence.\\nCommander Jane Connors, the Met\u2019s Violence Lead, said: \u201cWe are ready and prepared to deal with any potential violence that may become apparent as the lockdown restrictions ease.\\n\u201cThis operational activity already places us on the front foot to prevent any emerging incidents of violence.\\n\u201cThis surge activity gives officers the ability to assess intelligence and identify certain areas where there is a risk for these crimes to occur.\\n\u201cOfficers will then be deployed to these locations to focus on deterring these crimes and making communities feel safer.\\n\u201cOur presence will be noticed, you will see officers on the streets carrying out a range of activity.

Everybody's been confined to their flats or space. It\u2019s built up frustration.\\n\u201cLockdown is going to finish, everyone will be going out enjoying the sun, having a drink and letting their hair down.\\n\u201cTo top that off, at the moment you\u2019re stuck inside with everyone on social media sending messages, sending verbal abuse to wind people up.\\n\u201cWhen you do get let out of lockdown, you\u2019re going to see oh that's the person who made the comment about my mate, social media is too wide open and people need to be held responsible for their actions.\\n\u201cI can see it happening, people are going to be finding out where people are and you\u2019re going to be seeing revenge attacks. I do think that it could have been prevented a lot more.\u201d\\nOfficers have previously praised the spring time restrictions for helping to curb gang activity, \u00a0as less people were on the street, but are now fearing a backlash as the country looks to remove them.\\nIt comes as the Metropolitan Police have pledged to have more officers on the streets as lockdown eases in an attempt to reassure residents.\\nCommander Dave McLaren\u00a0said: \u201cAny life which is lost through violence in London is a tragedy and simply one too many.\\n\"We know the traumatic and devastating impact these crimes have on victim\u2019s families and friends and that remains at the very centre of why we do, what we do.\\n\u201cWe must remember that homicide is at the most extreme end of the violence scale and this year violent crime levels remain low.\\n\"Homicide numbers fluctuate from month-to-month and for this reason we must look at much wider timeframes to identify and better understand trends.\\n\"Last year the number of homicides significantly reduced by 16 per cent compared to 2019 as did the wider violence picture across London by\u00a026 per cent.\\n\u201cOur top priority in 2021 continues to be reducing violent crime\u00a0and\u00a0Londoners can expect to see more officers on the streets to prevent and respond to violence in all its forms.\\n\\n\"These officers will be deployed to high risk locations to carry out a range of activity \u2013 all aimed at keeping communities safe.\\n\u201cI urge anyone to share any piece of information about violent crime they may have.

Everybody is so reliant on somebody else providing everything for them that when things did get a little bit tense the results were scary.\\n\u201cAnd when we saw that, we were extremely glad we\u2019d come here.\u201d\\nMatthew and Charis\u2019 way of life has become the new frontier for many as the coronavirus pandemic has sparked a huge rise in people seeking advice on how to prepare for the possibility that civilisation could collapse.\\nWhile the idea is far from a new one - just ask the Mayans or the Romans - France witnessed an explosion in students of la collapsologie, or collapsology, in the wake of the virus last year.\\nIn the UK, retailers selling basic survival goods saw sales rocket up to 5,000 per cent, while others want those who live self-sufficiently like Matthew and Charis to teach them how to not depend on others to survive.\\nHere, Sun Online explores the collapsology movement...\\nDoomsdayers. Survivalists. Preppers. There are countless names and variations for those who believe the end is nigh.\\nMany are dismissed as conspiracy theorists. But while collapsology has its roots in the same idea, the reaction on how to cope is different.\\nRather than bunkering down alone in an abandoned nuclear facility and preparing to weather the storm alone, the movement aims to save society as a society - starting rural, communal lifestyles while welcoming communication with the wider world.\\nOne collapsology Facebook group in France saw its numbers reach 30,000 members during the first lockdown and the idea is turning mainstream thanks to support from senior politicians, respected authors and a popular Black Mirror-style drama series.\\nCollapsology warns of the possible fall of society as we know it as problems like climate change expose our unsustainable lifestyles.\\nThe movement was born on the back of Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jared Diamond\u2019s celebrated book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed in 2005.\\nThe work focuses on the effect environmental impacts - such as droughts, dwindling crop yields and swings in temperature - had on ancient civilisations.\\nHowever, Diamond also looks at the similarities those societies faced with today\u2019s world - including environmental changes, the impact of climate change, hostile neighbours and trade partners.\\nThe theory was further popularised by a 2015 book, How Everything Can Collapse, by Pablo Servigne and Rapha\u00ebl Stevens.\\nSome of its supporters, like former French environment minister Yves Cochet, believe the coronavirus crisis is just a further sign of impending catastrophe.\\nPeople who follow the collapsology movement aren\u2019t waiting for the apocalypse, nor believe the end of the world is fast-approaching.\\nMore, they are expecting and preparing for the fall of our current civilised society.\\nUnlike doomsday preppers and other survivalist movements, collapsologists live among us in mainstream society and don\u2019t intend to frighten people.\\nRather, they work to prove the number of potential crises that could burst one day and explore what we can do to ease this.\\nPeople in the collapsology movement think about how we can prepare the new world to be built quickly and in the best way.\\nWhile the term is yet to truly take hold in the UK, thousands have been looking at becoming more independent since coronavirus hit.\\n\u201cOur sales have gone through the roof, as high as a 5,000 per cent increase,\" Lincoln Miles, 27, owner of Preppers Shop UK in Newquay, Cornwall, said last year.\\n\u201cThe supermarket panic buying in March definitely showed us how fragile it all is and how quickly everything can change.\\n\u201cI think we only just avoided what could have been a real crisis, but the fact that it got so close to it made people wake up and realise we can\u2019t rely on this because this could happen again.\\n\"The fragility of the whole system was exposed.\u201d\\nMany followers of collapsology are keen to stress it isn\u2019t just another Facebook conspiracy video, nor is it the prediction of the sudden and apocalyptic end of the world.\\nIt\u2019s about uniting to act upon scientists\u2019 warnings on the effects of climate change, as well as archaeologists' study of how whole empires can fail.\\nLo\u00efc Steffan, a French economist and author of Don\u2019t Be Scared of Collapse, says Covid-19 \u201cwas a stress-test that has allowed us to see what works and what doesn\u2019t\u201d.\\nThe collapsologist wants to save society. The survivalist is an individualist\\nThe self-declared optimist, who is a prominent figure in the French movement, adds: \u201cThe collapsologist wants to save society. The survivalist is an individualist.\u201d\\nFor others, it\u2019s a commitment to sustainability, while helping others to do the same.\\nThe movement, which sprung from Jared Diamond's 2005 book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, struck a chord with many, including Essex vets Matthew and Charis.\\n\u201cI had read a few collapsology books, including Jared Diamond\u2019s, and found that I myself had had a collapse in faith in the stories of our culture and societies,\u201d reveals Matthew.\\nThe scientists\u2019 warnings are pretty stark, and often not stark enough.\\n\u201cThe scientists\u2019 warnings are pretty stark, and often not stark enough.\\n\u201cI just started to think: \u2018You know, I\u2019d be more comfortable with a little patch of land where I could learn to provide our needs for ourselves rather than relying on mortgages from banks and food from supermarkets,\u2019 so that\u2019s what we did.\u201d\\n\\nMatthew and Charis, 35, bought three acres of land in Pembrokeshire for \u00a335,000 and spent a further \u00a325,000 on building a house, chicken coops, greenhouses, a horse poo-powered gas cooker and even a hot tub.\\nThey are entirely self-sufficient, installing solar panels, growing their own fruit and veg, building beehives, rearing up to 140 chickens and converting lorries and flatbed hay trailers into zero-carbon living quarters.\\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t gone full hippy though,\u201d Matthew says. \u201cWe still have Netflix and Disney+. We aren\u2019t cut off from life entirely - but we are entirely dependent on ourselves now.\"\\nSince buying the land in 2011 and making the full-time move a year later, Matthew and Charis have had daughter Elsa and son Billy.\\nAs their lives on Beeview Farm have grown, so has the buzz about it from others.\\nAfter years of mistakes and learning on the job, Matthew and Charis are now running farm tours and even classes so others can follow.\\n\u201cWe\u2019ve only been running the tours and courses for about a year and the interest has been growing,\" Matthew adds.\\n\u201cPeople are desperate to come but we\u2019ve had to postpone visits because of the virus.\\n\u201cThere are people who want to do it and our message is: \u2018Go. Just do it, do it.\u2019\\n\u201cIf you trust what the scientists are saying in any way then you don\u2019t have time to waste waiting for it to be proved.\u201d\\nIs it the beginning of the end? It all depends on who you ask.\\nIn France, Yves Cochet, a former environment minister for the government, predicted the start of the end by 2030 as a result of a petrol crisis or environmental change.\\nHowever, after coronavirus, he now says: \u201cIt\u2019s happening even faster than we thought.\u201d\\nI tend to think that humanity will stagger on until it absolutely can\u2019t.\\nIn the UK, one of the country\u2019s few academic \u201ccollapsologists\u201d Dr Guy Middleton remains wary of making total apocalyptic predictions.\\nThe Newcastle University lecturer, whose published books include Understanding Collapse: Ancient History and Modern Myths, says: \u201cPutting it in terms of Extinction Rebellion or Greta Thunberg, the idea that action is necessary now, is really important - but without the survivalist mentality.\\n\u201cOur society now sits on a scale that is absolutely unprecedented including the rate of extinction of marine and land species, pollution of oceans, plastic pollution and so on.\\n\\n\u201cBut I tend to think that humanity will stagger on until it absolutely can\u2019t. It might lose a lot of people but it\u2019s probably not going to be in the next 50 years.\\n\u201cWe are a resilient and adaptable species.\u201d\\nWords like \u201cscary\u201d, \u201ccollapse\u201d and \u201ccatastrophe\u201d are often used when describing the reasons people decide to quit \u201cnormal life\u201d.\\nHowever, Matthew insists the two biggest factors others should follow suit are entirely positive.\\nHe says: \u201cOne, it is terrific fun. And two, it just makes complete financial sense.\\n\u201cThe difficulty of doing it sometimes stems from the \u2018prepper movement\u2019, I would never describe us as preppers. But it is often seen as revolving around conspiracy theories.\\n\u201cWe\u2019re going with the scientists - it\u2019s a good idea to prep, but we\u2019re not prepping for the Millennium Bug or anything like that.\\nWe don\u2019t owe anybody any money and we don\u2019t have any bills - why aren\u2019t more people doing this?\\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a farm for a lot less than \u00a3100,000 and it\u2019s all ours.\\n\u201cWe don\u2019t owe anybody any money and we don\u2019t have any bills - why aren\u2019t more people doing this?\u201d\\nLincoln, who has run the UK\u2019s biggest prepper shop, for almost seven years, believes people are keen to strike a balance between convenience and independence.\\nHe adds: \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether people are necessarily moving off grid due to it but there\u2019s definitely a huge resurgence in people going back to the old ways of doing it themselves, like making their own bread or learning actual skills rather than relying on products from a shop.\\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of going back to basics and learning to do it from scratch.\\n\\n\u201cPeople are thinking how they can filter water rather than buy water or provide their homes with energy if there was no electricity, changing their houses to be a bit more off-grid without living in the wild.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth being ready. There seems to be a big mindset change over the last couple of years and coronavirus is going to be a real catalyst to make people really think: \u2018We\u2019ve got to do something, we\u2019ve got to get something ready\u2019.\"", "image": [["The Watkinsons' wooden house in the Welsh countryside", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/House-2.jpg?strip=all&w=960"], ["Vets Matthew

statues made a video questioning the effectiveness of the Covid vaccine.\\nToyin Agbetu, 53, was signed up by Sadiq Khan this week to join his new racism commission.\\nThe activist would be a key figure in Labour's plan to remove statues and road names of historical figures connected to the slave trade.\\nIt has now emerged Agbetu made comments about the Pfizer Covid vaccine in November before it was approved, The Times reports.\\nHe posted a video alongside a message that read: \u201cApparently a magical vaccine is around the corner from the Viagra specialists.\\n\"There\u2019s a lot of nonsense out there and it\u2019s coming from the clowns in No 10.\u201d\\nIn the clip, he suggested politicians should get the jab on live TV with their grandparents and \"allow us to monitor them for nine months Big Brother style\".\\nAgbetu added: \"As a scientific breakthrough yes it looks promising but using it now, when there are so many questions unanswered because of a \u2018profit over people\u2019 government that wants to privatise speed over safety and effectiveness is ethically unsound.\"\\nThe teaching assistant has now crowed back on his comments and praised the life-saving jab.\\nHe told the newspaper: \"My position on this important matter is not to dismiss the legitimate concerns of people who were let down by the government who denied ethnic disproportionality was a factor leading to unnecessary deaths in our community during the pandemic.\\n\"Vaccines are an important part of the solution to help resolve the global crises we all face due to coronavirus.\u201d\\nAgbetu famously confronted the Queen in 2007 at Westminster Abbey during a service to mark the abolition of slavery.\\nMore recently, he has been pivotal in the campaign to remove a monument to slave trader Sir Robert Geffrye outside the Museum of the Home, in Hackney, East London.\\nThe museum consulted with the public after the Black Lives Matter protests and decided to keep the statue.\\nIt is now reviewing that choice after the statue\u2019s hands were daubed with red paint and protests were held by Stand Up To Racism Hackney.\\nAgbetu has featured in a video of a protest posted Momentum Hackney\u2019s Facebook group clutching a megaphone.\\nHe can be heard yelling \"The passage of time, doesn\u2019t wipe out the crime\u201d and \u201cGeffrye must fall\u201d.\\nThere are currently 130 Labour-led councils reviewing statues and road names.\\nOther statues under threat include a monument to former prime minister and founder of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Robert Peel, in Manchester.\\nThe City of London Corporation last month confirmed it would remove two sculptures of ex-Lord Mayor William Beckford and philanthropist MP Sir John Cass over their historic links to the slave trade.\\nSix schools have also been renamed and eight others have renamed buildings to avoid problematic links to slavery.\\nBut campaign group Save Our Statues fears erasing history if the monuments are removed.\\nThey said: \"During the past year we have witnessed an unprecedented array of attacks and vandalism upon our precious physical heritage in the UK, seemingly with no due diligence whatsoever.\u201d\\nBoris Johnson has now ordered a review into both hard-Left and hard-Right extremists hijacking movements - including BLM and Extinction Rebellion.\\nMr Khan's office has defended hiring Agbetu for its diversity commission.\\nA spokesperson said: \u201cAll panel members were assessed for the role by a review panel and a decision made based on what they could bring to the role.\\n\\n\"Toyin Agbetu was appointed for his significant expertise, knowledge and experience as a social rights activist and in setting up Ligali, which challenges the misrepresentation of African people and culture in the media.\\n\"His vast experience will provide a valuable contribution to the commission.\u201d", "image": [["Toyin Agbetu, pictured
