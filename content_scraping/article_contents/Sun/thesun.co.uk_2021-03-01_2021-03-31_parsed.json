They won't protect us, they'll attack us.\"\\nThe organisers of the vigil yesterday, Sisters Uncut, said: \"No more police powers. We will not be silenced.\"\\nThey added: \"Let's demand safety for all women. If the government is serious about ending violence against women, they will halt the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. They will fund domestic violence services instead.\"\\nOn Saturday, cops were filmed dragging women away from a bandstand\u00a0as thousands gathered in Clapham, South London, to remember Sarah Everard.\\nReclaim These Streets, who lost a High Court battle to hold the event, said in a letter to Met Police Chief Commissioner Cressida Dick they had \u201creached out proactively\u201d to the Met Police to try and hold a Covid-safe event.\\nThey said: \u201cWe find it particularly extraordinary that you said you would have attended the vigil yourself had it been lawful.\\n\u201cThe only reason parts what ultimately took place, without our involvement, may have been not lawful (though whether it was or not is unclear) is your Metropolitan Police Force failing to work with the women leading Reclaim These Streets to develop a lawful, proportionate and safe event.\u201d\\nThey also claimed that the Force had \u201cput people at a serious health risk through a lack of Covid-safe marshalling and at risk of being manhandled, fined and arrested by your officers\u201d.\\nA women photographed as she was arrested at a vigil for Sarah Everard wept as she told of her terror saying: \"I was more scared than I've ever been.\"\\nStudent Patsy Stevenson was pinned down and cuffed on Saturday night.\\nShe said: \"To be honest, I still\u00a0don't know why I was pushed to ground so forcefully.\\n\"I'm quite small, and it was two very large male officers who pulled me back quickly and I hit the ground.\\n\"From start to finish it was a whirlwind. It happened very quickly - I was only there to lay candle down. I didn't expect that to happen.\"\\nPatsy says she was freed just 20 minutes after being taken into custody and ordered to pay a \u00a3200 fine.\\nSarah Everard, 33, was allegedly kidnapped and murdered after vanishing in Clapham, south London, on March 3.\\nWayne Couzens, a serving Metropolitan Police officer,\u00a0has been charged with Sarah's murder and kidnap.\\nThe 48-year-old was remanded in custody after a short hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Saturday.\\nHe will appear at the Old Bailey in London today.\\nFormer Prime Minister Theresa May has insisted young men and boys must be taught about respect for women and what is acceptable in a relationship.\\n\\nSpeaking in the Commons as MPs considered the police response to the vigil in memory of\u00a0Sarah\u00a0Everard, she described the 33-year-old marketing executive as a \"bright young woman\" who was \"dearly loved\" by her family.\\nShe added: \"We want justice for\u00a0Sarah.
