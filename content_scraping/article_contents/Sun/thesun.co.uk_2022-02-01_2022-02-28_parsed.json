I\u2019ve spoken to her and she\u2019s a pleasant woman.\\nBut under her command the Met has become far too woke and not focused enough on what should be its primary concern \u2014 fighting crime.\\nI wish more effort was put into aiding the victims of burglaries and violence than box-ticking politically correct initiatives.\\nOn Dame Cressida\u2019s watch, the force has played politics while the public lost faith that the Met were arresting the bad guys.\\nThe crime statistics speak for themselves.\\nBetween January and December last year, the Met had what\u2019s called a sanction detection rate of just 3.8 per cent for house burglaries.\\nJust over 1,500 of the capital\u2019s 40,000 burglaries resulted in criminals being charged, receiving a summons or a community penalty.\\nThat\u2019s pathetic. Taxpayers deserve far better.\\nLast year was the worst on record for teenage killings in London.\\nDisgracefully, 30 teenagers were murdered in the capital \u2014 the highest figure since records began in 2003.\\nWith the streets of London becoming a bloodbath, the Commissioner was presiding over scandal after scandal.\\nLast month it emerged officers at Charing Cross police station had exchanged disgusting messages.\\nA male officer told a female officer that he would \u201chappily rape\u201d her.\\nThen there were the two PCs stationed at the crime scene of murdered sisters Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman in a North London park in June 2020.\\nThey were jailed after taking photos of their bodies and sharing them with friends and colleagues on WhatsApp.\\nPerhaps the biggest scandal during her tenure was when an official report described her force as \u201cinstitutionally corrupt\u201d last June.\\nThe report said Dick had personally placed \u201churdles\u201d in the way of a search for the truth about the murder of private investigator Daniel Morgan in 1987.\\nShe messed the inquiry around. That was awful leadership for the boss of the Met.\\nWhen I was a police officer, it was a bit like the BBC TV series Life On Mars, which showed rough and tumble, old-school policing.\\nFor me, policing wasn\u2019t a job, it was a mission. Being a police officer should be like being a nurse or vicar.\\nIt should be a way of life, not just a means to pay the mortgage.\\nBack then it was a hard-talking and hard-drinking culture, but we wanted to solve crimes and help victims.\\nWe certainly wouldn\u2019t take photographs of murder victims then pass them around for a laugh or talk about raping WPCs.\\nBut today\u2019s police say all the right things yet do all the wrong things.\\nThe paradox seems to be that the more politically correct the force has got, the worse the behaviour of its officers has been.\\nPeople used to be proud of the police.\\nPeople looking in from other countries thought we had the best police in the world.\\nThat\u2019s clearly no longer the case.\\nSo what went wrong? And who can come in to clean up the mess?\\nA working class lad from Bolton, I spent 28 years in the police force rising to the rank of Detective Chief Inspector before retiring in 2017.\\nMy route into the police service was \u2014 like many in my day \u2014 via the Armed Forces. I served five years in the Royal Military Police.\\nWhen I was at Hendon police training college, something like half the recruits at the passing out parade had medals on their chests because they\u2019d been soldiers, sailors or airmen.\\nWhen I went back before I retired, I saw just one military medal among some 60 recruits.\\nThe ex-Armed Forces recruits have been replaced by university graduates.\\nIf you\u2019re walking down a dark alleyway and you get attacked, who would you want to help you?\\nA copper who\u2019s seen service in Afghanistan or one who\u2019s got a degree in sociology?\\nI don\u2019t believe the public shares the Met\u2019s politically correct obsessions.\\nPeople don\u2019t complain that an officer who has turned up to investigate a break-in is a particular colour, gender, sexuality or class.\\nThey just want an officer who will investigate and catch the burglar.\\nI believe the reason Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion protestors were treated with kid gloves when they blocked roads to ambulances and other workers was because ex-university student police officers empathised with them.\\nI think it\u2019s time we looked beyond the ranks of the police force for a new Commissioner.\\nThey\u2019ve got to be radical and a crime-buster.\\nIf it\u2019s the same type of character as Dame Cressida, then things won\u2019t change.\\nSomeone from outside needs to come in.\\nSo I propose Home Secretary Priti Patel should bring in a former senior member of the Armed Forces.\\nWe need that military ethos for a policing culture change that will be for the good of society.\\n\\nAnd the first item in their in-tray? Stop focusing on the fluffy woke stuff and get on with solving crimes.", "image": [["Cressida Dick is the epitome of everything that is wrong with policing today and has presided over scandal after scandal", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NINTCHDBPICT000683579864.jpg?strip=all&w=960"], ["Rising star Cressida Dick pictured in 1997", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/6f55d5a3-43aa-4b4b-99f3-b5149600e191.jpg?strip=all&w=613"], ["Mick Neville is a former Metropolitan Police Detective Chief Inspector", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NINTCHDBPICT000231139812.jpg?strip=all&w=762"]], "author": ["Mick Neville, Former Met Det Ch Inspector"], "date": "2022-02-11"}}
