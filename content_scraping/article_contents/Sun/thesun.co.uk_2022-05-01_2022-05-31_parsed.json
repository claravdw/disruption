The highly-symbolic moment is his closest role yet to that of a king.\\nThe Queen's dramatic withdrawal sparked fresh fears for her health a month before\u00a0her Platinum Jubilee party.\\nIt's the first time since 1963 she has failed to attend the State Opening, and only the second time ever.\\nPalace sources have repeatedly reassured Brits that she is not ill, and is suffering \"episodic mobility problems\".\\nHowever, there are now fears over whether she will appear at all at her\u00a0four-day Platinum Jubilee\u00a0from Thursday, June 2.\\nIn her absence, Charles took on the head of state's major constitutional duty. It's a move that will be seen by many as a significant shift in his responsibilities as king-in-waiting.\\nIt's also the first time William, who wore a morning suit, has attended the State Opening.\\nThe Duke of Cambridge travelled separately, and arrived ahead of his father and stepmother, pausing to meet dignitaries.\\nNeither of the royals sat on the throne, which was instead kept empty.\\nCharles also chose not to wear a crown, and took his seat in his naval uniform beside future queen consort\u00a0Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.\\nThe Queen will have her weekly phone audience with the Prime Minister on Wednesday. Her Imperial State Crown, the Cap of Maintenance and the Sword of State were transported to the Palace of Westminster in three state limousines ahead of the service.\\nIt's also a big day for Boris Johnson, who is trying to pull his embattled premiership back on track with a slew of promises delivered in the nine-minute speech.\\nThe PM used the ceremony to light a bonfire of Brexit red tape and drive forward his levelling up agenda after months of distraction.\\nKey promises include:\\nHowever, he warned the Government could not \"completely shield\" people from the rising cost of living.\\nThe PM said the \"aftershocks of Covid-19 and the biggest war in Europe since 1945\" were causing disruption around the world, with all major economies facing pressures.\\n\"No country is immune and no government can realistically shield everyone from the impact,\" Mr Johnson said.\\nIn all, the speech featured 38 Bills, including seven measures scrapping EU regulation - covering areas from data reform to gene-editing to financial services - as ministers seek to capitalise on the benefits of Brexit.\\nIt included a new crackdown on \"guerrilla protests\" with jail sentences of up to six months and unlimited fines for those who glue themselves to roads or \"lock on\" to public transport infrastructure.\\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said the measures were necessary to prevent protest groups like Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion from bringing the country to \"a grinding halt\".\\nIn a sign of the Government's determination to drive them through now, officials said the legislation could be introduced in Parliament as early as Wednesday.\\nMr Johnson said all of the measures are part of a wider programme to get the country \"back on track\" after the pandemic while addressing the cost-of-living challenges.\\nIn a tweet ahead of the Speech, the Prime Minister said the Government is \"focused like a laser\" on the issues that matter most to the public.\\nHe wrote: \"In these challenging times, this Government will provide the leadership needed to deliver for you. Your priorities are our priorities and we are focused like a laser on the issues that matter to you most.\"\\n\\nA Schools Bill for England was also announced. It will crack down on truancy, beef up the powers of education watchdogs and reform the funding system.\\nA Media Bill will enable the privatisation of Channel 4, and a Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill will give local leaders powers to rejuvenate high streets, by forcing landlords to rent out empty shop units.", "image": [["Charles sat beside the Queen's crown this morning as he delivered her speech", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000731928571.jpg?strip=all&w=960"], ["He was joined by William and Camilla for the service", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000731929047.jpg?strip=all&w=960"], ["The Queen 'reluctantly' decided not to attend the State Opening of Parliament today for the first time since 1963.
