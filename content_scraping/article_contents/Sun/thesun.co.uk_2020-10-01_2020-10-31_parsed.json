If I remember rightly, the theme that year was \u2018Horrible Histories\u2019. Carrie did Theatre Studies and was lovely.\\n\"Very committed, passionate and involved. I\u2019m not surprised to see where she is now.\\n\"I knew she moved in those circles and I heard she\u2019d got a job with the Conservatives.\\n\u201cA lot of people in the society have gone on to work in the theatre and arts.\u201d\\nThe drama bash was held at the luxury Wroxall Abbey Hotel in Warwickshire.\\nOne onlooker said: \u201cThe students were all letting their hair down and enjoying themselves.\\n\u201cThe annual ball is a big event in the theatre calendar at the university and everybody would down their fair share of alcohol. Carrie in particular got a lot of attention from the male students.\\n\u201cBut so did the friends she was with. They were the \u2018It crowd\u2019. All strong, independent women who knew what they wanted out of life.\\n\u201cThey were glamorous and it was obvious they would make a success of themselves.\\n\u201cCarrie and the others were fairly down-to-earth though. They worked hard and played hard and this night proved it.\\n\u201cAll were having an enjoyable yet respectful time. Nothing got out of hand.\\n\"It was harmonious and joyful. Carrie was a party girl and was well-liked.\\nCarrie was very committed, passionate and involved. I\u2019m not surprised to see where she is now.\\n\"They\u2019ve all enjoyed great career success \u2014 just in places you could say they were 180 degrees apart.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating to think Carrie goes off to have a relationship with someone some of the others are clearly not a fan of.\u201d\\nOne, Jo Duncombe, 32, now works for the British Council as a film programmer and curator.\\nShe tweeted: \u201cPlease not Boris\u201d when David Cameron announced his resignation the day after the EU referendum in 2016.\\nA few months later Carrie visited The Quarter Club, a networking event organised by Jo and another pal in the snaps, Saskia Roddick.\\nCarrie described it as an \u201cincredible night\u201d and said her two university pals were \u201camazing women\u201d.\\nBy David Wooding, Assistant Editor\\nWHETHER at a toga party or inside the Tory party, Carrie Symonds is always great fun.\\nAs our pictures show, the PM\u2019s fiancee was as popular as a student as she is with the political elite today.\\nShe has a real spark about her. She\u2019s got a wonderful sense of humour, but is professional and mature beyond her 32 years.\\nIn her time as a special adviser and communications boss, she would brief ministers almost twice her age.\\nCarrie also had a knack of dealing with awkward journalists \u2014 yours truly included \u2014 with respect and without losing her cool. Her friends describe her as warm, kind and loyal.\\nHer love for animals and protecting the environment shows her natural empathy.\\nShe knows when to work and when to relax.

The audience was masked up like the Hole In The Wall Gang. Tess Daly\u2019s eyes were the regulation two metres apart.\\nThen some maniac let Anton du Beke sing during the professionals\u2019 group dance, without a thought for the public\u2019s well-being or a possible follow-up to his From The Top album.\\nSo it\u2019s probably just as well I\u2019m in the mood to cut Strictly Come Dancing some slack this year, on the grounds that it\u2019s not one of those shows which can simply brush off social-distancing.\\nIndeed, the fact it\u2019s on at all is a bit of a production miracle, but it still looked slightly bereft, at the weekend.\\nThe audience is now threadbare, Tess and Claudia are hardly in the same postcode and Craig Revel Horwood\u2019s stuck behind a squat little rotunda looking like a camp Davros.\\n\u201cWe are of course also missing Bruno Tonioli due to travel restrictions,\u201d Claudia announced very solemnly, at the start. So it\u2019s not all bad news.\\nIf the hosts were expecting the bookers to dig them out of a hole, none of the early signs looked good, as Caroline Quentin, an American Football player, Ranvir Singh and Clara Amfo all came, went and told us their partner was: \u201cThe one I was hoping for blah blah blah.\u201d\\nA nice enough bunch, clearly, but if Strictly is really to take personal hold, one of the things it needs is a chirpy young nuisance to get under my skin.\\nAs luck would have it, then, the next contestant was christened Harvey Cantwell but developed irritable vowel syndrome at the age of 17 and renamed himself HRVY on the grounds that: \u201cI needed to be a lot cooler so I thought, \u2018Why not lose two vowels out of my name?\u2019.\u201d\\nWhy? \u2019Cos it\u2019ll make you look like a mssve dckhd, obviously.\\nIrritants like HRVY and Jamie Laing may be a help, but what any series of Strictly really needs to thrive is comedy input, and it\u2019s here that bookers might just have unearthed a couple of gems.\\nThe most obvious is Bill Bailey, who is that rarest of things for a modern comedian. He\u2019s both funny and likeable.\\nHe\u2019s also pretty nimble on his feet and a fast learner, so I don\u2019t think, after Saturday night\u2019s experience, he will ever attempt to bounce jokes off the glass facade of Tess Daly again.\\nYou would hope the BBC understands Bill\u2019s comedy potential. I worry, though, that the only pairing it really cares about is Nicola Adams and Katya Jones, the show\u2019s first same-sex couple.\\nPersonally, I think it\u2019s a minor tragedy Strictly didn\u2019t do this back in 2009, with Joe Calzaghe and Anton du Beke, as Dancing On Ice has already stolen their thunder here and all it does now is unbalance the voting process and allow a lot of applause chasers the opportunity to try to bask in the show\u2019s reflected PC \u201cglory\u201d.\\nThe great thing about Strictly, though, is that it takes just one thing to sideline all its worthy intentions.\\nSometimes it\u2019s a scandal. On Saturday it was the group dance, where the real comedy genius of the piece revealed herself, flapping around like one of those megaflatables at the Cup Final, during the Phil Collins number.\\nIt\u2019s former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, who can\u2019t even point in tune, and at a stroke has mothballed partner Anton du Beke\u2019s singing career and answered her own question: \u201cHave I got any natural dance ability?\u201d\\nNo, you haven\u2019t, Jacqui. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\\nThe Chase, Bradley Walsh: \u201c\u2018Remember, all you can win is a brand new dustbin\u2019 was a catchphrase on what game show?\u201d\\nAbrar: \u201cOnly Fools And Horses.\u201d\\nTipping Point, Ben Shephard: \u201cWhich shipping forecast area in the North Sea shares its name with a Nordic invader?\u201d\\nTom: \u201cChristopher Columbus.\u201d\\nBradley Walsh: \u201cThe term Public Service Announcement is often abbreviated to what three letters?\u201d\\nPhilip: \u201cTHO.\u201d\\nBen Shephard: \u201cPapillon is the French word for which flying insect?\u201d\\nSharron: \u201cDog.\u201d\\nBBC1\u2019S latest piece of left-wing propaganda dressed-up as drama is called Roadkill, and it\u2019s about as subtle and balanced as hedgehog entrails on a set of Pirellis.\\nNo surprise, really, as it\u2019s written by champagne socialist David Hare, who\u2019s thrown all the prejudice, anger and snobbery he\u2019s got at this political \u201cthriller\u201d (A LOT), so there\u2019s a surfeit of gormless proles asking for selfies from the word go.\\nEvery single character adheres to the BBC\u2019s strict gender/race guidelines as well, of course (all white men are evil).\\nBut most of Hare\u2019s public school condescension is reserved for a working-class version of Boris called Peter Laurence, who\u2019s got a mistress, an illegitimate child, only the vaguest of Tory principles and a habit of telling people: \u201cThe voters think of me as a character.\u201d\\nWhich is just as well, really, as you\u2019d never have guessed it from the rest of the script or Hugh Laurie\u2019s performance.\\nThe real void at the heart of this angry mess, though, is the plot.\\nBecause the only crime Laurence seems to have committed is trying to \u201csell off the NHS to a right-wing American think tank\u201d. An idea that I know will give luvvies a fit of the vapours and I\u2019m surprised the BBC sound department didn\u2019t add a clap of thunder every time it\u2019s mentioned by one of the cast.\\nBut come on, Pete. Next week I want you and your think tank: Abolishing the licence fee, reintroducing the death penalty, for everyone from murderers to noisy neighbours, deploying the SAS to deal with fly-tippers, raising the voting age to 47 and forcing the compulsory sterilisation of all Extinction Rebellion activists who, for the sake of the planet, can start putting their reproductive organs in the same place as their noisy, disruptive, pain-in-the-a*** principles.\\nThen, episode three, we start on the right-wing stuff, or I\u2019m done with Roadkill.\\nWhat caption reason was used to justify the appearance of Love Island\u2019s Olivia Bowen on Steph\u2019s Packed Lunch earlier this month?\\nA) \u201cLiving with an underactive thyroid.\u201d\\nB) \u201cLiving with an overactive publicist.\u201d\\nTHAT poor woman who claimed she was engaged to a ghost called Ray was back on This Morning last week, with some bad news.\\nThe worst possible, in fact.\\n\u201cThe wedding to my ghost lover is off,\u201d read the caption.\\nThis, of course, is the ongoing fantasy world of a woman called \u201cAmethyst Realm\u201d, who\u2019s spared us no details in four previous visits to the ITV studio, where she\u2019s told viewers, among other things, that her spirit partner asked her to marry him at Wookey Hole and they once had sex in an aeroplane toilet, on the way to Thailand, which is technically Spooky Hole.\\nYou know how it is, though, girls.\\n\u201cHe got in with the wrong crowd,\u201d Amethyst explained.\\n\u201cHe\u2019d disappear for days and started bringing other spirits home, who\u2019d stay for days.\u201d Ollie Reed? Hurricane Higgins? Keith Moon\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009?\\nWe may never know.\\nBecause, before she could get into the nitty-gritty, there was a ghostly crashing noise from the other side of the studio, which could\u2019ve been Ray, or could\u2019ve been Errol Flynn staking his claim, but turned out to be Alison Hammond, whose a*** had just dislodged an ornamental cactus, in the competition area.\\nBy the time spiritual calm had been restored, Amethyst was telling viewers: \u201cI\u2019m happy, free and single\u201d (form an orderly queue, fellas) and Phillip Schofield was begging her to: \u201cKeep us updated.\u201d\\nWhich I hope she does.\\nIn the meantime, though, This Morning\u2019s presenters will never stop reminding us just how much they care about mental health.\\nJamie Redknapp: \u201cI\u2019m not trying to stick up for the referee, but he was useless.\u201d\\nIain Dowie: \u201cThe striker was arm-stronged out of it.\u201d\\nBill Leslie: \u201cThe rivalry was built in the 70s with those FA Cup meetings in \u201996 and \u201997.\u201d\\nTHIS week\u2019s winner is Whitey, the albino rat from Flushed Away, and GMB\u2019s host Piers \u201cAlligator Arms\u201d Morgan.\\nSent in by James McGuire.
