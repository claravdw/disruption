Josh Widdicombe. An episode dedicated to the Last Leg co-presenter which I hoped might clear up exactly when Zippy from Rainbow and a Cabbage Patch Doll mated their way into his gene pool.\\nIt didn\u2019t, sadly, but what we got was almost as good, even if the show took a little while to get going.\\nIndeed, there were nearly 15 minutes of dead ends and false dawns before viewers were introduced to Josh\u2019s great grandfather times ten, Henry Rich, who owned London\u2019s Holland Park and was such a thorough-going royal creep Charles\u2009I made him his \u201cGroom to the stool\u201d.\\nA position lost in so much indignity and flowery language it required Hampton Court historian Tracy Borman to explain: \u201cYour ancestor accompanied King Charles I to the toilet.\\n\u201cAnd would make sure he was in a fit state to be presented to the public court.\u201d\\n(Nervous laughter)\\n\u201cDoes that mean wiping\u2009.\u2009.\u2009?\u201d\\n\u201cIt does.\u201d\\nJosh Widdicombe\u2019s forebear, later executed by Parlia\u00admentarians for his sycophancy, was Royal A*** Wiper to the House of Stuart.\\nAn official position that still exists today, I believe, and is currently occupied by Gyles Brandreth, although Josh thought: \u201cIt sounded like the worst job in history.\u201d\\nWhich is a bit rich coming from a bloke who\u2019s paid to find Adam Hills funny.\\nStill, if all we learned from this exercise was that Josh Widdicombe was merely continuing this family tradition, it would have been a worthwhile hour.\\nThis was one episode of WDYTYA, though, that didn\u2019t run out of steam, and from that point onwards the bombshells kept dropping.\\nFirst we learned that Josh\u2019s great grandmother x12, Lettice Knollys, was involved in a love triangle with Elizabeth I.\\nThen there was a suggestion he was directly related to Henry VIII, on account of the fact Anne Boleyn\u2019s sister, Mary, was also in the family tree, which was followed by the most staggering revelation of all.\\nJosh Widdicombe\u2019s x23 great grandfather is King Edward I of England.\\nThe correct response to this stunning news, of course, should have been: \u201cWhat? You\u2019re telling me I\u2019m Danny Dyer\u2019s cousin?\u201d\\nUnfortunately, Josh didn\u2019t have it in his locker. In fact, he had no reaction other than the industry standard \u201cOh wow\u201d, and was churning out five \u201cWows\u201d a minute at one point.\\nA reaction that tells you one of two things.\\nEither celebrities are too over-entitled and ego-driven to be impressed by anything these days, or a distracted Josh was already working out how to ruin this amazing story with a really dreadful show at the Edinburgh Fringe.\\nWhatever the truth of it, this should probably have been the point where the BBC put Who Do You Think You Are? into cold storage until it can find a story as good as Josh or Danny\u2019s.\\nI suspect, however, Auntie\u2019s poverty porn addiction is too serious to give up on the show and all the ensuing misery will ensure this fine episode is merely remembered as the one where we learned there is no history of comedy in Josh Widdicombe\u2019s family.\\nWow.\\nWHO Do You Think You Are? Josh Widdicombe: \u201cHe was on the scaffold for an hour before he was beheaded? What goes through your mind?\u201d\\nAn axe, eventually.\\nFORGIVE the heresy, but I always detested The Darling Buds Of May on account of the fact they looked and sounded far too much like an off-shoot of the Fred West clan for my liking.\\nNotwithstanding the presence of Bradley Walsh, who remains television\u2019s single greatest all-round entertainer, I\u2019ve got similar reservations about ITV\u2019s cheerfully sinister reboot, The Larkins, who also feel like they\u2019re hiding a really dark secret.\\nThe Inland Revenue may have rumbled the selfish sods\u2019 tax evasion but there\u2019s a far worse crime hiding under Pa\u2019s barn extension, trust me on this one.\\nEven assuming most of you don\u2019t feel the same way about The Larkins, though, the most culturally diverse village in post-war Kent still has an unavoidable issue with the casting.\\nThe saving grace of the early 90s original was, of course, the discovery of Catherine Zeta-Jones, who was very obviously one of the most beautiful women on the planet.\\nThis time round they\u2019ve attempted to fill the crucial Mariette role with Bridgerton\u2019s Sabrina Bartlett, who may be a good-looking lass, but she\u2019s not in the Catherine Zeta-Jones magnetism class.\\nNor, as the script keeps claiming, is she anything like \u201c19\u201d. Indeed, if I had to hazard a guess, I\u2019d say she\u2019s probably older than the former Soviet Republic of Kyrgyzstan, which turns 30 in December.\\nTalented as she may be, Sabrina\u2019s also got the slightly world-weary voice of a middle-aged Englishwoman, making a mockery of all the script\u2019s teenage flirtations and Mariette\u2019s wanderlust, which had village snark Pauline warning her, if she ran off to Paris, she\u2019d end up living: \u201cWith a drunken t***pot, in Dover, looking 50.\u201d\\nOr as ITV probably refers to this period: \u201cEpisode four.\u201d\\nMASTERMIND, Clive Myrie: \u201cIn May 2021 which football club won the English Premier League for the third time in four seasons?\u201d\\nTara: \u201cGermany.\u201d\\nThe Chase, Bradley Walsh: \u201cIn Israel the Law of Return allows anyone of what faith to claim citizenship?\u201d\\nRebecca: \u201cIslam.\u201d\\nBradley Walsh: \u201cWhat celestial body is the focus of the Japanese festival of Tsukimi?\u201d Sarah: \u201cSumo Wrestling.\u201d \u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009\u201cThe moon.\u201d\\nALL those exhibitionist eyesores, on Channel 4\u2019s My First Threesome, probably putting every viewer off the idea permanently.\\nAnton Du Beke dragging every Strictly verdict back to the subject of himself.\\nITV reminding viewers just how much it now hates its own audience with Angela Black.
