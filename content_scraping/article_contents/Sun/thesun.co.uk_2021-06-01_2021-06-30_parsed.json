which can identify and track targets while providing coastal surveillance.\\nAnd there will be 15 explosives search dogs and handlers from the army operating under police command.\\nVideo footage emerged of two Sea King and three Osprey helicopters soaring above Cornwall and Devon as they did test runs of President Biden's route from the airbase to Tregenna Castle Resort in St Ives.\\nThe airspace above Cornwall is largely shut - but cops are reserving the option to deploy one of their 18 drones if necessary.\\nOn top this, some 1,000 police will be staying on a cruise liner at Falmouth harbour and in camper vans parked at the RAF base in Newquay.\\nIt had been reported that the world leader was expected to leave the Cadillac \u2018The Beast' mega-car in his homeland amid fears they might get stuck in the rural county\u2019s narrow and winding roads.\\nNow it's been revealed they were transported into the UK in a Boeing C-17 Globemaster III ahead of the arrival of Air Force One.\\nThe specially built \u00a31.1million Cadillacs both have five inch-thick bulletproof windows capable of withstanding a nuclear, biological or chemical attack.\\nEncased in ballistic armour and weighing about nine tonnes, each contains a sealed cabin with an oxygen supply and bags of blood matching Biden\u2019s type in case of a medical emergency.\\nAnyone foolish enough to grab the cars' door handles without authorisation can expect to be hit with a 120-volt shock delivered at the flick of a switch from those inside.\\nThe cost of policing the summit has been put at \u00a370million - but Devon and Cornwall Police won't be bearing the cost alone, with officers called in from other forces.\\nA run of good weather and the easing of lockdown restrictions has meant every hotel and B&B within a 30-mile radius of the summit has been booked by holiday-makers.\\nImages have surfaced of caravans clogging the A30 on Monday, leaving much of the road along the Devon-Cornwall border paralysed by traffic.\\nLeaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US are meeting in Cornwall for the annual G7 summit this Friday and are expected to discuss Covid vaccine donations to developing countries and a 15 per cent global tax rate.\\nThe vehicles are expected to be driven to Tregenna Hotel, where President Biden will be staying for three days.\\nUS pilots were also spotted practice landing a chopper - known as Marine One when the US President is on board - on Tregenna Castle golf course on Monday evening.\\nOther jets were seen tracing the route Air Force One will take when it arrives at Newquay Airport later this week.\\nThree US Marine Osprey aircraft\u00a0were also seen over hovering over Haldon Hills near Exeter then Carlyon Bay and finally at Tregenna Castle yesterday evening.\\nThe aircraft were brought over by US Air Force's Boeing C-17 Globemaster III and offloaded at the Royal Navy airbase Culdrose, near Helston, on Sunday.\\nAs part of a security ramp-up ahead of Friday's meeting, police have closed down up to 30 bridges across the A30 - one the main road leading into and through Cornwall.\\nAlso known as the Group of Seven, these countries are seven of the largest economies of the world.\\nTogether, they represent more than 62 per cent of the global net wealth ($280trillion).\\nThe group was founded in the early 1970s as the seven countries discussed concerns about the collapse of the oil industry.\\nSince then, 43 summits have been held across the globe as members discuss everything from the environment to the economy.\\nThe group was previously known as the G8 and counted Russia among its members, but Russia has been excluded since annexing the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in early 2014.\\nA barrage of steel fences have been planted around Tregenna Castle as many roads and footpaths remain shut for up to 21 days.\\nOne notice reads: \"It is necessary to mitigate the danger to the public or damage to the highway (from incidents) that may arise from the hosting of an event taking place in Carbis Bay.\"\\nResidents living near the meeting venue will have to show two forms of ID to be allowed past check points.\\nDevon and Cornwall Police are expecting protests over weekend from groups like Extinction Rebellion.\\nMore than 6,500 police from forces across the UK are set to be deployed during the summit.\\nA police spokesperson for G7 planning said: \"We will be deploying over 6,500 officers and staff to this event and we are supporting a vast range of local businesses and suppliers as part of our extensive logistical arrangements.\\n\"This includes using over 4,000 rooms at almost 200 venues across Devon and Cornwall which will support local communities and accommodate police officers and staff deployed from across the UK.\\n\"In order to secure further essential capacity, we reviewed a number of options and recently agreed to hire the MS Silja Europa, operated by Tallink; taking into account impacts to the environment, community, the operational needs, and those of our officers and staff.\\n\\n\"The vessel will remain static, moored in Falmouth, used for a 10-day period, with only the accommodation, catering and other essential facilities in use.\\n\"We are working closely with the vessel owners, ports authorities and health partners to ensure the safe use of this accommodation. Those staying onboard will strictly follow all the applicable Covid safety guidelines, enhanced by daily testing - consistent with staff staying at all other accommodation sites across the force area.\"", "image": [["HMS Prince of Wales is pictured lurking in the distance of Carbis Bay", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000658409449.jpg?strip=all&w=960"], ["The presence of the aircraft forms part of a larger 'ring of steel' secuity effort", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000658409447.jpg?strip=all&w=960"], ["It comes as Joe Biden arrives for showdown talks with Boris Johnson", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000658420345-1.jpg?strip=all&w=960"], ["They were joined by their wives Carrie Johnson and Jill Biden", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000658421168.jpg?strip=all&w=960"], [null, "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/KS-COMP-STEEL-5.jpg?strip=all&w=815"], ["The President arrived in the UK yesterday", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000658264419.jpg?strip=all&w=692"], ["Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden disembark from Air Force One as they arrive at RAF Mildenhall ahead of the G7 Summit", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000658263605.jpg?strip=all&w=960"], ["Biden landed ahead of the historic talks", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000658262877.jpg?strip=all&w=960"], ["Joe Biden and First Lady Jill seen making their way off of Air Force One", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000658264106.jpg?strip=all&w=960"], ["Joe Biden has flown in two of the massive Cadillacs each dubbed The Beast", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dk-comp-trump-car-v34.jpg?strip=all&w=750"], ["People stand on stepladders and peer through the fence as they wait for the arrival of Joe Biden in Air Force One at RAF Mildenhall", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000658261072.jpg?strip=all&w=960"], ["Joe Biden is flying from Washington to RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk aboard Air Force One", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000658260933.jpg?strip=all&w=960"], ["Two Osprey choppers parked on St Michael's Mount near Penzance", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000658044164.jpg?strip=all&w=770"], ["Close up of a United States Marine Corps (USMC) Osprey helicopter", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/67810f34-b8ff-4780-a1e3-42e5e59148df.jpg?strip=all&w=960"], ["A man snorkelling off the coast at Carbis Bay", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/c63a8833-ff65-4e5a-9174-249bae8500ab.jpg?strip=all&w=960"], ["Road blocks, similar to those used on London Bridge following a spate of terror attacks, have been deployed in Carbis Bay", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000657869220.jpg?strip=all&w=960"]], "author": ["Claudia Aoraha", "Jacob Bentley-York"], "date": "2021-06-10"}, "https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15201556/us-secret-service-agents-storm-cornwall-ahead-of-g7/": {"title": "ALL SYSTEMS JOE Secret Service agents \u2018storm\u2019 Cornwall with helicopters and landing craft ahead of Joe Biden\u2019s visit for G7 summit", "subtitle": "", "text": "US Secret Service agents stormed Carbis Bay today ahead of Joe Biden's arrival to the G7 summit in Cornwall this weekend.\\nPresident Biden's security entourage will be staying in hired camper vans because there is simply not enough accommodation to house them.\\nMore than 50 luxury cars and 400 Secret Service agents touched down at St Mawgan airbase near Newquay ahead of Biden's arrival on Wednesday.\\nVideo footage emerged of two Sea King and three Osprey helicopters soaring above Cornwall and Devon as they did test runs of President Biden's route from the airbase to Tregenna Castle Resort in St Ives.\\nOn top this, some 1,000 police will be staying on a cruise liner at Falmouth harbour and in camper vans parked at the RAF base in Newquay.\\nA run of good weather and the easing of lockdown restrictions has meant every hotel and B&B within a 30-mile radius of the summit has been booked by holiday-makers.\\nImages have surfaced of caravans clogging the A30 on Monday, leaving much of the road along the Devon-Cornwall border paralysed by traffic.\\nThe US recreational vans -
