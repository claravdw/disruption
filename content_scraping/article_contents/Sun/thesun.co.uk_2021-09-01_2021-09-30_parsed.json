The standstill traffic was caused by the protest. One car was squashed into half its size.\"\\nPhotos from the scene show a wrecked car alongside two white vans and another black vehicle.\\nPolice later set up a blue tent on the highway as their investigations continued throughout the day.\\nMeanwhile, videos posted on social media show angry drivers remonstrating with the activists.\\nAt the height of the incident, there were seven miles of queues along the route.\\nGovernment officials are among those to slam the protesters for blocking the road.\\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: \"These actions are not only highly disruptive to those going to work and transporting vital goods, but are putting lives at risk on a busy motorway.\\n\"Not to mention the resulting traffic delays will only add to vehicle emissions.\"\\nSome 89 activists from Insulate Britain brought traffic to a standstill.\\nOne mob blocked Junction 23 at South Mimms, Hertfordshire.\\nA second group shut down the main carriageway from Junction 8 at Reigate to Junction 9 at Leatherhead, both in Surrey.\\nSome even glued their hands to the road in the Dartford Crossing area at Junction 1A and 1B.\\nThe climate change group, dressed in hi-vis and brandishing banners reading 'please turn off your engine', plonked themselves in the middle of the road in both locations.\\nProtesters also held signs saying \"sorry for the disruption\" as angry drivers quickly lost patience.\\nDo you recognise any of the protesters or did you witness the crash? Email alice.fuller@the-sun.co.uk or call call 0207 782 4368\\nSome stuck motorists yelled \"we'll lose our jobs\" and honked their horns but the demonstrators refused to budge.\\nOther shouted: \"Go and find something better to do with your lives.\"\\nA lone officer at one of the scenes reportedly told the protesters: \"I\u2019m going to have to ask you to move.\"\\nHe then strolled back to his car, witnesses say.\\nInsulate Britain reps are demanding the Government \"make significant legislative change to start lowering emissions\".\\nA spokesman added they were taking action again today to get Britain's homes insulated and create thousands of jobs and save lives.\\nAmong those held up shortly after 8am was an NHS worker trying to get home after a night shift.\\nJay told LBC: \"I'm exhausted. I'm not happy with the situation.\"\\nAnd pharmacist Graham Weidle, who is not able to get to work, said: \"I need to open a pharmacy in Soho.\\n\"I think [Insulate Britain] are just going the wrong way about it. They are doing this for effect but not for sympathy.\\n\"We all support climate change, we all support sustainability and we all support a more regenerative way of life. But this doesn't help.\\n\"Every car here has its engine running and that's tens of thousands of cars.\\n\"They are just working against themselves. I don't believe they have any support.\"\\nIn response to the criticism, a spokesman for Insulate Britain said: \"You're angry. So are we. You're afraid for your job. So are we. You feel powerless. So did we.\\n\"But sitting in the road makes Boris Johnson sit up and take notice. So we're staying, until 10 Downing Street get on with the job.\"\\nThey added: \"The people in cars are angry, they are outraged, they are disgusted. Rightly.\\n\"What a thing to do. What stupidity. What idiots. So why are we doing it?\\n\"Because we are angry, because we are outraged, because we feel disgust beyond words.\\n\"Because we will not stand by and see our families suffer, their livelihoods destroyed and our country betrayed. Never. Never.\"\\nThis action is not only incredibly dangerous in potentially putting lives at risk but it also backfires in environmental terms by causing more delays and more vehicle emissions.\\nSwarms of cops finally made it to the scene, with Surrey Police arresting a total of 25 people in connection with the incident between Junction 8 and 10.\\nOfficers said they were also attending the scene of a serious four-vehicle crash - but it is unclear if this is related to the protests.\\nIt follows Monday's disruption which saw more than 90 Insulate Britain members arrested.\\nThe madness caused up to five hours of delays for tens of thousands of drivers on the M25 - and things turned sour when furious motorists tried to drag resistant protesters away to clear the roads.\\n\\nAA president Edmund King said: \"This action is not only incredibly dangerous in potentially putting lives at risk but it also backfires in environmental terms by causing more delays and more vehicle emissions.\\n\"These are some of the busiest sections of the M25 where tens of thousands of drivers will have been affected and has a negative knock-on effect on economic activity.\"\\nDo you have a story for The Sun news desk?\\nEmail us at exclusive@the-sun.co.uk or call 02077824104.

Rebellion protests are taking up 2,000 officers a day to police, a top cop has revealed.\\nThe Met's Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said hundreds of officers were being pulled from regular duty to police the protests, which has seen activists block vital transport routes and glue themselves to monuments over 10 days of chaos.\\nTwist told Times Radio: \"It's been extremely busy over the last 10 days, we've had nearly 2,000 police officers every day just looking at trying to manage these protests.\\n\"This is because it's not the numbers of protesters but it's the level of serious disruption that they're looking to cause, which is impacting on other Londoners.\\n\"We've said right from the start, we know Extinction Rebellion has the right to protest and the right to assemble.\\n\"But what we also made clear is these are qualified rights and they have got to be balanced against the rights of the rest of London and Londoners, the people, the businesses, the communities who want to lawfully go about their business.\\n\"Where we've seen cases of both very serious and totally unreasonable disruption looking to be caused, we have to take action and move in and make arrests.\"\\nThe stark comment comes as previous XR protests, which ran for two weeks, took 21,000 officers to police - that's around 1,500 a day.\\nLast month, the Met said the disruptive protests had cost the British taxpayer \u00a350million in policing since 2019 and resulted in more than 3,760 arrests, with almost 2,000 people being charged.\\nIn the latest wave of protests, XR activists have targeted a range of landmarks and blocked London Bridge with a bus.\\nSome have glued themselves to the Science Museum, with the Met revealing it's had to remove 81 people glued to an object and another 52 who've chained themselves to something over the past 10 days.\\nThe Met has also arrested nearly 500 people since the protests broke out.\\nIt said 480 people had been arrested in the capital since XR launched its latest tirade dubbed \"Impossible Rebellion\" on August 23.\\nPrevious XR protests have seen activists armed with hammers smash the glass at the Barclays Bank HQ in London.\\nIn April, seven activists from the controversial group\u00a0used tools to break the glass\u00a0and pasted the message \"In Case of Climate Emergency Break Glass\" on the front of the building.\\nAnd in October 2019, bungling activists\u00a0attempted to spray fake blood at the Treasury\u00a0from a fire extinguisher before losing control of the hose and letting the red paint pour across the London street.\\nOther demonstrations have seen\u00a0activists create bamboo blockades\u00a0outside newspaper printing presses in a bid to muzzle the media.\\nRecently, activists marched through the capital with placards, banners and sashes urging people to \"save the planet\", with thousands descending upon the Tate Modern before moving across Millennium Bridge.\\nDemonstrators continued as far as The Bank of England on Queen Victoria St, where they blocked the road.\\n\\nToday marks the thirteenth consecutive day of action as part of XR's two-week \u201cImpossible Rebellion\u201d.\\nIt is taking place in the run-up to the UN's COP26 summit.\\nDo you have a story for The Sun news desk?\\nEmail us at exclusive@the-sun.co.uk or call 02077824104.
