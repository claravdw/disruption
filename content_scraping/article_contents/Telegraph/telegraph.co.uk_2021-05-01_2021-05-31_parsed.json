At some sites, protesters attached themselves to large bamboo structures they had erected.\\nAnimal Rebellion, which calls itself a \u201csister organisation\u201d to Extinction Rebellion, said that the demonstrations began at around 4.30am on Saturday and would last at least 24 hours. Protesters said they were targeting the burger restaurant for its role in deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to the \u201cclimate emergency\u201d.\\nA McDonald\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cOur distribution centres are currently facing disruption. We are assessing the impact on deliveries to our restaurants and to menu items. We apologise to our customers for any disappointment caused.\u201d\\nAt the Heywood site, one protester, dressed as the Ronald McDonald clown mascot, placed himself in wooden stocks. Kerri Waters, another activist in Heywood, said police arrived there after protesters were involved in a \u201cscuffle\u201d with distribution centre staff.\\nA Greater Manchester Police spokesperson said: \u201cOfficers are currently in attendance to maintain safety whilst facilitating the right to peaceful protest.\u201d\\nMiss Waters told The Telegraph that the protest was \u201cnot impacting the ordinary consumer \u2013 what we\u2019re trying to do is get attention from McDonald\u2019s.\u201d\\nAlex Lockwood, a protest organiser, said: \u201cWe know that simply stopping the trucks going [out of centres] will cause economic disruption to McDonald\u2019s.\u201d\\nMr Lockwood added that one of his organisation\u2019s aims was to pressure McDonald\u2019s, the home of the Big Mac burger, to scrap meat from its menus by 2025, to help reduce animal farming\u2019s impact on the environment.\\n\u201cMcDonald\u2019s beef burgers are a huge source, an iconic source, of greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve gestured towards a few plant-based meals, but they haven\u2019t done anywhere near enough for an organisation of their size to take responsibility for their role in the climate emergency.\u201d", "image": [["Activists set up blockades at the burger chain\u2019s distribution hubs across the UK on Saturday, condemning the company\u2019s \u2018contribution to the climate emergency\u2019", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2021/05/22/TELEMMGLPICT000259313786_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqgsaO8O78rhmZrDxTlQBjdMrCYOIHjH5ODDpJLCunRBI.jpeg?imwidth=680"]], "author": ["Jamie Fullerton"], "date": "2021-05-22"}, "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/05/25/britons-divided-wokeness-culture-wars-academics-find/": {"title": "Britons divided on \u2018wokeness\u2019 and \u2018culture wars\u2019, academics find", "subtitle": "A new study reveals that people are just as likely to think being 'woke' is a compliment as they are to think it's an insult", "text": "Britons are divided on whether \u2018woke\u2019 is a compliment and are unaware of an apparent ongoing \u2018culture war\u2019, academics have found.\\nThe Merriam-Webster dictionary defines \u2018woke\u2019 as aware of and actively attentive to important facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice) and, depending on the company and the intention, can be used as either a compliment or an insult.\\nAs a result, the UK public are as likely to think being \u2018woke\u2019 is a compliment (26 per cent) as they are to think it\u2019s an insult (24 per cent), researchers have found. However, most people are more likely to say that they do not know what the term means (38 per cent).\\nIn the first study of its kind analysing culture wars and identity politics in modern Britain, the Policy Institute at King\u2019s College London (KCL) and Ipsos MORI surveyed almost 3,000 adults and found that a majority of the public have hardly heard of the phrases \u2018cancel culture\u2019 or \u2018identity politics\u2019, and that there is limited awareness of the culture war debate more generally in the UK \u2013 despite a surge in headlines on the subject in recent years.\\nProfessor Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Institute, said: \u201cAn incredible surge in media discussion of \u2018culture wars\u2019 in the UK has not yet been matched by widespread public engagement with key concepts in the debate, or an understanding of their meaning \u2013 as seen in the very different interpretations of being \u2018woke\u2019.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s vital to recognise that the vast majority of the public are currently not deeply interested in the heated language and content of culture war disputes.\\n\u201cBut this doesn\u2019t mean they are unimportant: the evolution of culture wars in the US shows that these sorts of conflicts often start from the top, with broader political and media messages working their way through to public consciousness, and ending in a greater sense of division.\u201d\\nThe research marks the first in a series of reports that provides an in-depth assessment of the UK\u2019s culture wars. It found that 82 per cent of the public say they have heard at least a little about the term, \u2018white privilege\u2019, including 55 per cent who say they have heard a lot about it \u2013 by far the most widely known concept of those asked about.\\nIn contrast, 72 per cent of people said they have either never heard of the term \u2018microaggressions\u2019 or have heard of them but know very little, while 61 per cent say the same about both \u2018cancel culture\u2019 and \u2018identity politics\u2019, and 54 per cent are similarly unaware of \u2018trigger warnings\u2019.\\nFurthermore, while most people say they have heard at least a little about various other culture war terms, this is often almost matched by substantial minorities who are less aware of them. For example, 53 per cent report hearing a lot or a little about \u2018cultural appropriation\u2019, compared with 46 per cent who say they know very little about it or have not heard of it at all.\\nMajor events and social movements in recent history have apparently contributed to the emergence of a culture war in the UK - a concept which is historically more closely related to US society.\\nAttitudes on race, gender and sexuality have changed dramatically between generations and have more recently been amplified by historic events and movements, including: Brexit, the murder of George Floyd, Black Lives Matter, Extinction Rebellion, protests and counter-protests and the debates surrounding statues of controversial historical figures including Cecil Rhodes, Winston Churchill and Edward Colston - whose statute was toppled in Bristol last year.\\nHowever, Professor Duffy suggested it was arguable that we have a culture war in the UK because the media insists there is one, and because this is a sentiment that is only amplified by social media.\\nHis research found that there was \u201ca huge surge\u201d in related media coverage in recent years, from just 21 newspaper articles focused on the issue in the UK in 2015 to over 500 in 2020.\\nBut the concept has also infiltrated the Government. Gavin Williamson, the education minister, plans to install a \u201cfree speech champion\u201d inside the regulator for higher education, after speakers from across the political spectrum found themselves disinvited - or \u2018no platformed\u2019 - from events.\\nHe announced the plans earlier this year, warning against the \u201cchilling effect\u201d that \u201cunacceptable silencing and censoring\u201d has on university campuses.\\nHowever, the Joint Committee on Human Rights conducted an inquiry in 2018 and concluded there is no free speech crisis on campuses.\\nResponding to the research, Ben Page, chief executive of Ipsos MORI, said: \"Culture wars are not new \u2013 but the recent focus on them is largely driven by the media and politicians themselves.\\n\u201cOur research shows that in fact the public have a much less clear understanding of what \u2018culture wars\u2019 mean, and which side they are supposed to be on.\\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t meaningful differences along the spectrum, as seen in the different reactions towards being \u2018woke\u2019 by young and old, Labour and Conservative voters, Remain and Leave. Our future releases in this research programme will explore the public\u2019s views in detail: how divided do we think are, what are the faultlines, and what do the different tribes think of each other?\u201d", "image": [["Protesters throwing a statue of Edward Colston into Bristol harbour during a Black Lives Matter protest rally last June", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2021/05/09/TELEMMGLPICT000246367145_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=680"]], "author": ["Gabriella Swerling"], "date": "2021-05-26"}}
