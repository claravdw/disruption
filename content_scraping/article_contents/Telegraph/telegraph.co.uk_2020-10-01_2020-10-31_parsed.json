Not the natural habitat of Sir David Attenborough, but here he is, aged 93, in a suit and tie, addressing a room full of financiers, CEOs and world leaders. He is showing them clips of film, the consequences of our actions upon the natural world: an orangutan clinging to the sole branch of a single tree in what used to be a verdant rainforest; horrific footage of enormous walruses tumbling from cliffs, unable to find anywhere to rest because the retreating sea ice has forced hundreds of them on to one small beach. The audience is visibly moved. In the front row, Christine Lagarde, then head of the IMF, is in tears.\\nAttenborough, onstage, comments on the film clips, explaining\u00a0in his measured, soothing voice, how it has come to this, how we have effectively destroyed our most crucial resources and, most importantly, what can be done about it, what they \u2013 sitting in that room, people of influence and power and financial clout \u2013 can do about it. The following day he is interviewed on stage by the Duke of Cambridge, and there is a standing ovation.\\nThere is a clip of this event in the new film A Life on Our Planet, which, along with the accompanying book, is effectively David Attenborough\u2019s last stand. He calls it his \u2018witness statement\u2019.\\nAnd he is indeed a unique witness \u2013 David Attenborough is in the extraordinary position of having seen more of the natural world than probably anyone else, in a career\u00a0that began in the holocene age \u2013 the 12,000- year geological period of climatic stability when wildlife was still profuse \u2013 at a point when access to it, via international travel, had just become easy. Since then, the human population has tripled, and the number of wild animals, once prolific, has halved. And the planet is one degree warmer \u2013 which may not sound like much, but it is a speed of change that exceeds any in the last 10,000 years.\\nAs Attenborough noted in his Davos speech: \u2018We are in a new geological age: the anthropocene, the age of humans.'\\n\u2018We just need a new perspective \u2013 which is, try not to take out from the sea and the land more than the Earth can recover,\u2019 says the familiar voice, lightly muffled by technical problems of a Zoom call, deepened by age, but nonetheless unmistakably Attenborough. He is speaking from his home in Richmond, Surrey, where he has been grounded for months \u2013 interrupting the making of several projects, one on extinction for the BBC, and many with the word \u2018Planet\u2019 in their title. A Life on Our Planet had been about to premiere at the Royal Albert Hall in April, it was going to be the biggest release of a documentary in the history of British cinema, but all that was put on hold by lockdown. How did he cope with that?\\n\u2018I feel diffident about saying this because I have to bear in mind that I\u2019m not a married couple with a young child, because that must be desperate, but I\u2019ve been very lucky: I\u2019ve had a peaceful time.\u00a0I have a garden and\u00a0I live close to Richmond Park, so I\u2019ve got a lot to keep me happy. I watched the spring unfold and develop more closely than I have been able to do for decades \u2013 and what a joy it was.\\n\u2018My daughter Susan lives in the same house and looks after things, and keeps it running. I had overseas trips organised that have been cancelled, so I\u2019ve not spent time whizzing around the place, but I\u2019ve had a lot of writing to do.\u2019\\nThere is no sign of him slowing down. He managed lockdown restrictions by recording the commentaries to his next BBC venture, A Perfect Planet, \u2018sitting in my dining room with a microphone on the dining table and eiderdowns on the wall to combat the reverberation, and the recordist sitting in the garden in the rain under an umbrella\u2026 And that\u2019s quite a nice way of doing things, after a respectable breakfast, instead of having to get into a car and go to a studio at 7.30 am.\u2019\\nThe Cairngorms was the last place he visited, last winter, and he does not miss flying. \u2018Not at all. I feel embarrassed to say this because a lot of people have had a very, very rough time and I feel very sympathetic to the young who want to get around and see the world and go to parties, but when you get into your 80s and 90s you are more contemplative and quite happy to sit in the shade and think about life, which is mainly what I\u2019ve been doing.\u2019\\nAnd this is what he has come up with, what he always comes up with, what he has been showing us over and over again, for years and years and years: that nature is our biggest ally. Take care of nature, and nature will take care of us.\\nWe\u2019ve reached a tipping-point\u2019 has become a battle cry that we\u2019ve heard so often over the last decade that there is a danger of tipping-point fatigue. But you only have to look at the recent news \u2013 uncontrollable wildfires in Brazil, California and Oregon that have destroyed towns and communities and displaced half a million people; hurricanes and flash floods of overwhelming strength and frequency threatening the Gulf Coast. The rainforest is still being cut down faster than ever \u2013 3.8 million hectares are cleared annually, that\u2019s 15 billion trees a year \u2013 and as we all know by now, our planet is losing its ice: since satellite records began in 1979, summer sea ice has reduced by 40 per cent.\\nOnly last month, WWF reported that wildlife populations are down by two-thirds in less than 50 years. And when a UN panel asked 455 experts to investigate the state of the Earth, they discovered that one million species (out\u00a0of an estimated eight million) are at risk of extinction \u2013 that is, 100 times faster than would happen in the normal course of events.\\nBut, says Attenborough, it\u2019s not too late to change things, or at least to ameliorate them. The science is all there, the technology is there, the political will ought to be there, but the difficulty is in making people care. And this is where David Attenborough comes in \u2013 he makes people care.\\nPerhaps it is the voice, the poetic intonation, the gently erudite manner, the heft of knowledge \u2013 but there are reasons why David Attenborough has become the most\u00a0popular broadcaster in the world. We trust him: he never reads anyone else\u2019s scripts or does any advertising; you won\u2019t catch him sponsoring water filters or lending his name to a new line of paper straws. He had to maintain a level of impartiality when he was broadcasting on behalf of the BBC and he was relatively quiet about climate change until he was absolutely sure of the science.\\n\u2018There were a lot of people in the environmental world who were pushing David to speak out harder earlier,\u2019 says Colin Butfield of WWF, whose idea it was for Attenborough to address Davos, \u2018but he did what was typical of David \u2013 which is to make absolutely sure that he understood the science well. He completely immersed himself in it before he was willing to speak his mind.\u2019\\nAttenborough mildly contradicts this. \u2018I\u2019ve been talking about this for 30 years!\u2019 he exclaims. \u2018And nobody\u2019s taken any notice! If you look back you would find that certainly into the late \u201970s there wasn\u2019t a single series that I made where I didn\u2019t end up talking about what we ought to be doing in terms of looking after the planet, and what the dangers were.\u2019\\nNow, his new book, authored with filmmaker and science writer Jonnie Hughes, who has worked with him for years and also co-directed the film, brings all of this\u00a0together. It is a succinct homage to nature told through Attenborough\u2019s remarkable personal history, looking at the state of the world through chapters of his life. As he puts it, it is \u2018the story of how we came to make our greatest mistake and how \u2013 if we act now \u2013 we can put it right.\u2019\\nAnd there are many examples of governments making successful inroads into sustainability: Iceland, Paraguay and Albania already generate all their electricity without using fossil fuels; and who knew that Morocco has the largest solar farm in the world, providing 40 per cent of its needs? Or\u00a0that Costa Rica has now replenished half of the rainforest it had cut down by the \u201970s? Research has shown that marine life\u00a0could regenerate at an incredible rate if just 30% of the ocean\u00a0were protected. And there is hope for wildlife: in Attenborough\u2019s lifetime, mountain gorillas have made a huge comeback in east Africa; and sightings of blue whales, hunted down to the last one per cent of their population until whaling was banned in 1986, have exceeded all expectations.\\nDid it make him nostalgic, going through the archives and seeing the world as it used to be? \u2018What I\u2019m nostalgic for \u2013 if I can twist the word slightly \u2013 are things that I\u2019ve never seen. If you read books about travelling in Africa a century ago, you realise how impoverished the continent has become \u2013 there were herds of thousands of animals, animals like quaggas (half zebra, half antelope); stories of building railways amongst marauding lions. Wildlife was pullulating, and the oceans were so rich. The wealth of the natural world in the 19th century was overwhelmingly munificent, and that\u2019s all gone.\u2019\\n\u2018Pullulating\u2019 and \u2018munificent\u2019 \u2013 talking to Attenborough draws you straight into his lyrical, carefully written commentaries. \u2018Well I\u2019ve been writing narrations for a long time, for 50 or 60 years \u2013 and actually, I\u2019ve learned that fewer words is better. I take a lot of trouble writing them.\u2019 George Fenton, who composed the music for many of his early series, would treat his words like the main\u00a0character in a drama, working the music around the inflections of his voice.\\nThe voice has changed over the years, certainly. Its pitch has lowered and become more ragged, but it has lost none of its enthusiasm, whether he is exclaiming over the dancing prowess of the mantis shrimp or the octopus that can walk across land. And he\u2019s not above poking fun at himself, it was in that distinctive voice that he narrated an Adele video during an interview on Radio 1; he also made a documentary with Bj\u00f6rk about the intersection between nature and music. He\u2019s had at least 20 species named\u00a0after him and more honorary degrees from UK universities than anyone else, as well as countless awards. When he joined Instagram nine days ago, he broke the record for reaching a million followers \u2013 just over four hours (a record previously held by Jennifer Anniston).\\nDavid Attenborough was born in 1926 when the natural world was in a benign state,\u00a0in Isleworth. He was the middle of three brothers \u2013 and now the only survivor. His older brother, film producer and actor Sir Richard Attenborough, died six years ago, and his younger brother John died in 2012.\\nHe won a scholarship to study natural sciences at Cambridge in 1945, after which he did national service in the navy then joined the television business in 1952, as a producer. He became a broadcaster almost by accident, stepping in when a presenter, a zookeeper called Jack Lester, became ill. Attenborough and a cameraman were sent off on expeditions to find rare creatures and bring them back to be paraded on television, whereupon they would be dispatched to London Zoo.\\nHe laughs now when he remembers the simplicity of those days, before the idea of health and safety was conceived. \u2018The first trip I made was in 1954, when television was a tiny little hick organisation up in Alexandra Palace, and I remember going to see the man who looked after the administration of my department, and saying, \u201cI\u2019m off to Indonesia for three months.\u201d \u201cOh yes,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat\u2019s it going to be?\u201d And I said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to look for birds of paradise and things called Komodo dragons. About six half-hour programmes. We\u2019ll be back by Christmas.\u201d And off we went \u2013 we had a marvellous time and made these rather bad programmes.\u2019\\nThat was Zoo Quest, to be followed by several other series of increasing sophistication \u2013 and in 1965 he became controller of BBC2, then director of programmes for the BBC (where he commissioned key series such as Civilisation, The Ascent of Man and Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus) and he was mooted for the job of director general in 1972. Instead, he decided to devote all his time to making programmes about the natural world.\\nLife on Earth was his first ambitious, pioneering series \u2013 and it included the famous encounter in Rwanda between a young, laughing Attenborough lying on the ground and a mountain gorilla called Poppy sitting on top of him. \u2018There are so many more now than when we first filmed them in the 1970s,' he says. 'Every now and again, you see a thing like that and your little heart says, well at least we did something.\u2019\\nHis team went to 39 countries, filmed 650 species and covered 1.5 million miles for Life on Earth. It was watched by an estimated 500,000 people, and was, he says, the best time of his life. It was followed by many award\u00a0winning series and one-offs including The Life of Birds, Blue Planet and Frozen Planet. His last series, Our Planet, which came out on Netflix last year (and is now free on YouTube), has been downloaded 700 million times globally. And he has recently contributed to another film directed specifically at financial institutions \u2013 Our Planet: Too Big To Fail, a collaboration between Netflix and WWF, and featuring Mark Carney (now UN special envoy for climate action\u00a0and finance).\\nA Life on Our Planet (which opened in 550 UK cinemas last week \u2013 a huge number for a documentary \u2013 and will be available on Netflix tomorrow) is unusual in that Attenborough appears in person, close up, talking\u00a0directly to camera in a way that\u2019s almost confessional; it is moving and intense. The film was privately funded by donors from WWF, \u2018and that was very important to us,\u2019 says the co-director, Alastair Fothergill, a long-term collaborator, \u2018because we wanted to give David total editorial control, and inevitably with any broadcaster you can lose that. He was very personally involved in the film, and it shows a side of David you're never normally exposed to\u00a0\u2013 he\u2019s a classic, buttoned-up Englishman, but he is quite emotional in this film, which I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s seen before.\u2019\\nAttenborough lives with his daughter, Susan, formerly a teacher. His wife Jane died in 1997, after suffering a brain haemorrhage when he was filming in New Zealand. He has never remarried. His son is Dr Robert Attenborough, a professor of biological anthropology at Cambridge University.\\nHe lives simply, in the house he has had for years; he has no iPhone or email, he uses the post, and occasionally a computer. He had a knee operation six years ago, which\u00a0enabled him to continue working, but he doesn\u2019t exercise. \u2018I\u2019ve never taken exercise in my life\u2019. And he doesn\u2019t eat meat. \u2018I haven\u2019t eaten meat in a long time. It just went away \u2013 I can\u2019t explain it. It wasn\u2019t that I made a sacrifice or anything \u2013 for some reason I just went off it decades ago.\u2019 Perhaps it was the revelation that, as mentioned in the book, 60 per cent of mammals in the world are livestock, and we consume 50 billion chickens a year \u2013 most of which are fed on soy-based feed derived from deforested land.\\nThe film and book are at their most brutal when he outlines what could be in store for\u00a0someone born today, at our current rate of progress: the rain forest would turn\u00a0into a dry savannah, fish populations would crash, the methane produced by frozen soil thawing would accelerate climate change and large parts of the planet would become uninhabitable.\u00a0\u00a0But, he says now: \u2018I do believe that things are changing, and it is young people who are most vigorous and vocal at the moment \u2013 young people who will get older and take direct action, and the fact that they are as energised and concerned as they are is very good news.\u2019\\nHe has nothing but good things to say about Greta Thunberg, who he spent some time with last year. \u2018I think she\u2019s absolutely extraordinary, and she\u2019s very realistic about the issues; she is very modest and the first to say, we must listen to the science \u2013 don\u2019t listen to me, I\u2019m not a scientist, but it is my future nonetheless. And she says this with such power, and with such clarity that she is a very powerful voice, and that voice will last and resonate for much longer than mine, because she\u2019s 75 years younger.\u2019\\nHe is keen that protests should be heard, but is ambivalent about Extinction Rebellion. \u2018The question is, are they putting people off by disturbing lives? I think it\u2019s important that people should have their voices heard, that\u2019s for sure, but I think breaking the law can have a deleterious effect.\u2019\\n\\nAttenborough is a modest man and deflects any attempt at analysing his legacy. \u2018What\u00a0people will remember me for is the films, and what makes the films is the camera and directors, and big, big teams. I\u2019ve had a simply phenomenal time \u2013 I can\u2019t believe how lucky I\u2019ve been and my successors won\u2019t be as lucky because the stuff just won\u2019t be there.\u2019\\nHe doesn\u2019t have to be doing this: he could quite easily retire, he says. \u2018But I\u2019ve had unbelievable luck and good fortune and I would feel so guilty if I recognised the problems and decided to ignore them.\u2019\\nIn such a long career with so many memorable moments, when was he happiest? \u2018Going to Africa for the very first time, in 1960, was\u00a0unforgettable; and going to the South American rainforest, or swimming on a coral reef for the first time, or seeing a bird of paradise display \u2013 all those were revelations. People say that you don\u2019t get used to things like that \u2013 but you do get used to them. There is a freshness when you go to one of those places for the first time that is unrepeatable.\u2019\\nDoes he still come across things that surprise him about the natural world? \u2018Well, I\u2019m\u00a0discovering more new things all the time, because that\u2019s the pleasure of natural history. Nobody will ever know all there is to know about natural history and certainly things I read about now are new to me. But mostly, lately, it\u2019s been about reviving memories and knowledge that I had in my teens \u2013 seeing things again because I\u2019ve had the time. Instead of dashing around in aeroplanes, I\u2019ve had time to watch willows put out their catkins.\u2019\\nI ask him if there is anything out there that he would still like to see, \u2018Oh, lots of things.\u2019 He thinks for a moment. \u2018There are a couple of species of birds of paradise that I haven\u2019t seen\u2019, he says. \u2018I won\u2019t be able to now because that would involve walking for days and days through very thick undergrowth, which I can\u2019t do any more, but I wish I had seen them.\u2019 He warms to his theme and his voice takes on a different timbre; there is poetry, and yearning. \u2018There is this newly\u00a0discovered species that has been found in the last few years, and it happens to be a family of birds, which \u2013 in a funny, silly, irrational way \u2013 is full of drama and excitement and beautiful romance and one thing and another, and I just love them.\\n\u2018But when you get older you become more stoic. I\u2019m perfectly happy sitting in my garden watching the spring. When you\u2019re 94, sitting in the garden watching the spring is a very nice thing to do.\u2019\\nAttenborough reunited with HM (he produced her Christmas address between 1986 and 1991) in 2018 for The Queen\u2019s Green Planet, to draw attention to the need to protect forests. In the gardens of Buckingham Palace, they discuss everything from conkers to climate change.\\nIn an very moving sequence from Africa (2013), Attenborough is seen befriending and feeding a blind baby rhino called Nicky, then getting down on all fours to communicate with him.\\nFor the pioneering series Life on Earth (1979), Attenborough visits the mountain gorillas of Rwanda; and the resulting footage has been voted one of the top TV moments of all time.

From towering, 18th century-inspired wigs to Bella Hadid as a bare-chested, dagger-wielding bride, there\u2019s always a talking point.\\nWhich is not to say the seasonal collections offer spectacle merely for the sake of going viral. Usually there\u2019s a message and intent behind all the styling that\u2019s worth paying attention to. After all, Dame Vivienne Westwood has been talking about the climate emergency and James Lovelock\u2019s Gaia theory since before most Extinction Rebellion protesters were born. She espoused the \u201cbuy less buy better\u201d maxim before it was fashionable, when the idea that a designer - someone whose livelihood depended on selling new clothes! - would exhort us to reduce our consumption seemed paradoxical. Or worse, laughable. Oracles always seem a little out there to the rest of us.\\nThe brand\u2019s anarchic spirit ranged across a smaller stage this season by necessity. Instead of flashbulbs and spotlights in a gilded room at Paris\u2019s opulent H\u00f4tel de Ville, Andreas Kronthaler (Westwood\u2019s husband and the brand\u2019s designer since 2016) took his new collection to a white-walled studio and produced a video unlike any other fashion film we\u2019ve seen this season. Or ever.\\nFor one thing, he shot it himself. On his iPhone. For another, the extent of the action consisted of the participants reading or reciting poetry, by turns runic and profane. So Dame Vivienne read a translation of a Li Ho poem from 700 AD wearing\u00a0 a green, flower-sprigged silk dress. Longtime muse Sara Stockbridge delivered another Chinese poem from the same year in a blue leopard knit outfit, and\u00a0Irish model Vita Leandra even played a spot of harp.\\nStill imagery offered a closer look at the collection. On inspection, there were plenty of Westwood signatures: a corseted dress in a distressed Union Jack fabric, also used in a blazer and trousers; a T-shirt emblazoned with the directive, 'BUY LOCAL'. The latter may have been a harder message for globetrotting fashion fans to swallow pre-lockdown, when Kronthaler designed it. \"I had already designed this collection before Covid: small, existential and essential, our model for the future,\" he said in the collection notes.\\nThese are not clothes for everyone (though a brocade gown with an exaggerated sweetheart neckline and huge hip rosette definitely looks like an outfit for Helena Bonham Carter). But they don't have to be. They're clothes for the Westwood tribe, and the homespun project suited them.\\nIn fact the film seems a truer vehicle for the brand\u2019s values than any grand Paris catwalk. It\u2019s intimate, it\u2019s direct, and you can be sure that its production left\u00a0a smaller carbon footprint than the old ways. Westwood, a teacher before she turned to fashion,\u00a0said it best when Kronthaler finished reciting Ariel's song from The Tempest, tugging self-consciously at the bottom of his grey miniskirt all along. \u201cGood!\u201d she encouraged from off-camera. \u201cVery good!\u201d\\nFor more news, analysis and advice from The Telegraph's fashion desk,\u00a0click here\u00a0to sign up to get our weekly newsletter, straight to your inbox every Friday.

No wonder protest art is booming. The latest example has popped up in New York. Medusa with the Head of Perseus, by the Argentine-Italian artist Luciano Garbati, has just been erected in Manhattan, opposite the court where Harvey Weinstein was convicted of sex crimes in February.\\nGarbati\u2019s seven-foot\u00a0bronze statue flips the original Greek myth, in which\u00a0Perseus beheaded Medusa the Gorgon \u2013 and it echoes the great Renaissance sculptor Benvenuto Cellini\u2019s Perseus with the Head of Medusa (1554).\\nIn the age of protest, however, there are even protests against protest statues. Art critic Jerry Saltz has attacked the naked Medusa statue already, saying that she is\u00a0\u201cthe total object of the male gaze here,\u00a0not of thought, fear, admiration, pathos, power, agency\u00a0or anything other than male idiocy\u201d.\\nGarbati, too, has been attacked as the wrong sort of person to put together MeToo art. For instance, the American activist Wagatwe Wanjuki tweeted:\u00a0\u201cMeToo was started by a black woman, but a sculpture of a European character by a dude is the commentary that gets centred? Sigh.\u201d\\nClassically-minded critics have said that Medusa should really be holding the head of Poseidon who, in Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses, raped her. Others take against the general\u00a0idea of justice being dressed up as vengeance outside a courtroom.\\nI like the statue \u2013 and, even as an obsessive classicist, I like the way it plays around with myth. One of the great things about\u00a0Greek and Roman myths is that they are protean \u2013\u00a0a word that itself comes from Proteus, the Greek sea-god who can constantly change shape.\\nThe ancient myths are so elemental in our culture \u2013\u00a0and have been incorporated in so many guises in Western European art and literature \u2013 that they can be happily bent into any shape or context and still be recognised. This autumn, for example, a new computer war-game is being released: Troy \u2013 A Total War Saga. It\u2019s\u00a0based on the Trojan War but full of supposed \u201cerrors\u201d, with the inclusion of the Minotaur and the Cyclops, who don\u2019t appear in Homer\u2019s Iliad.\\nThe Medusa is a good way to do protest art. To catch the prevailing mood, protest art has to be made quickly.\u00a0Garbati actually sculpted this work in 2008; only now has it\u00a0been put up opposite the\u00a0New York State Supreme Court Building, where Weinstein stood\u00a0trial. The most famous piece of protest art in history, Guernica, was completed by Picasso in 1937, the same year that Guernica was bombed in the Spanish Civil War.\\nThe Medusa statue is more successful than the most recent British protest statue,\u00a0A Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020,\u00a0the black resin sculpture by Marc Quinn that went up in Bristol in July. It shows Reid, a black protestor, raising her arm in a Black Power salute. The statue was erected on the plinth where a statue to Edward Colston, the Bristol merchant involved in slave-trading, had stood until it was toppled and rolled into the city\u2019s harbour.\\nLike lots of protest art, the Jen Reid statue didn\u2019t last long \u2013\u00a0it was taken down by Bristol City Council the day after it was put up. The Medusa, too, is only temporary, and will be taken down next April. On the other hand, nor was the Reid statue\u00a0particularly striking. There\u2019s nothing wrong in being realist \u2013\u00a0protest art often is. But it was little more than a straight, here-and-now depiction of Reid at the Bristol protests; little more than a 3D snapshot.\\nEffective protest art has to add something beyond mere realistic depiction. Even the Trump baby, the huge inflatable of the US President that floated over protests against his visit to London in 2018, added a touch of the grotesque and the comic to mere lifelike depiction.\\nThe Medusa statue\u00a0flips a familiar story on its head, which immediately sparks an emotional and intellectual reaction in your brain. And it places the horrific amorality tale of Harvey Weinstein in the ancient, eternal world of Greek myth. The ancient Greeks knew a lot about monsters and sex crimes \u2013 Weinstein is an appropriate modern recruit to the classical rogues\u2019 gallery.\\nHarry Mount is author of Amo, Amas, Amat and All That (Short Books)", "image": [["Luciano Garbati's statue has gone up opposite the courtroom in which Harvey Weinstein stood trial", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/art/2020/10/14/TELEMMGLPICT000241846367_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq8Asj1eHb3tSpQqwok7bWe_isnIZ2woTKbq6H55zAFGk.jpeg?imwidth=680"], ["Garbati poses beside the Medusa sculpture this week", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/art/2020/10/14/TELEMMGLPICT000241870512_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqmRz2i0BYLgZHjHqS8l-QuTlaTMTxUhlzF8Rkw038U-A.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["Marc Quinn's controversial statue of Jen Reid was brought to earth soon after its creation", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/art/2020/10/14/TELEMMGLPICT000235092561_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqR1gN756bgu-Oq1JkfYLunIn2pZoIcmajc70c214YJZo.jpeg?imwidth=350"]], "author": null, "date": "2020-10-14"}, "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/05/hundreds-dead-animals-washed-russian-beach-ecological-disaster/": {"title": "Hundreds of dead animals washed up on Russian beach after 'ecological disaster'", "subtitle": "Surfers were left with vision problems and nausea after spending time in the water", "text": "Russian officials have admitted that a once-pristine beach in a remote area of the country may have been contaminated with toxic chemicals after activists declared an \"ecological disaster\" and filmed dozens of dead sea creatures.\\nGreenpeace said that sea pollution in the eastern Kamchatka peninsula had devastated the local wildlife population and left surfers and divers with damaged eyesight and poisoning symptoms.\\nLast week local social media users posted videos of a yellow-tinged sea and tourist hotspot Khalaktyrsky Beach, popular with surfers, strewn with dead sea urchins, octopuses, seals and fish.\\nLocals report an area as large as 25 miles has been affected, with hundreds of creatures killed.\\nRegional governor Vladimir Solodov said the pollution could have been caused by \"spills of some toxic substances\".\\nInspectors are due to examine two local military testing sites on Tuesday.\\n\"There are concerns; we will fully examine this tomorrow,\" Mr Solodov said, adding that the local government is also examining potential natural causes related to algae and \u201cseismic activity\u201d.\\nHe said divers have confirmed the mass deaths of sea creatures, but tests on the water flowing from a river into a bay did not show pollution levels above legal levels.\\nTourists had been urged not to visit a live volcano on Kamchatka, with authorities warning that eruption could be imminent.\\nBut local ecologists said that the crisis was unlikely to be caused by natural activity, pointing instead to an area nearby used to dump chemical waste.\\nGreenpeace raised the alarm after local surfers said they had been suffering from nausea and vision problems after leaving the water for\u00a0some weeks.

Now they are the ones in the park wearing the Lululemon kit with the ear buds and the glossy pony-tails.\\nProudest moment: Being a doula at their friend\u2019s birth.\\nGreatest fear: Cellulite.\\nWhat they wear: Cashmere and bare feet.\\nLeast likely to say: \u2018I\u2019m in Chicken Cottage, what are you having?\u2019\\nThe godfather of this tribe would be Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, sometimes described as \u2018a bit of a hippy\u2019, on account of his penchant for kombucha and a home-grown carrot snack, a four-minute cold shower in the morning, having an earring and assorted ropey bracelets, and being big on sustainability. This tribe ranges from keen kitchen gardeners, rewilders and avid environmentalists to the Daylesford crowd, who fully embrace raw denim aprons with leather straps and slate worktops, but are not about to cut down on their hefty carbon footprint (including five snowboarding children).\\nHow to spot them: Their hand-forged \u00a3500-a-pop kitchen knives.\\nProudest moment: \u2018Wild\u2019 swimming on Christmas Day.\\nGreatest fear: Having to make do with only one cooker.\\nWhat they wear: Can\u2019t resist a coyote trim.\\nLeast likely to say: \u2018We\u2019re just concreting over the front garden.\u2019\\nThe children of enlightened groovy parents, they tend to have trust funds or allowances (they\u2019re also known as Trust Fund Hippies), which explains how they get the time off work to glue themselves to Tube trains etc. But in many respects, they are the real deal, leading the way in recycling and composting, using up every last leek and carrot in homemade soups, mending their clothes, cycling whenever possible and eschewing all sorts of things that non-hippies consider to be essential: eg shampoo, leg-shaving, au pairs, schools (they\u2019re all homeschooling).\\nHow you spot them: They always have at least one child in tow; the boys are indistinguishable from the girls.\\nProudest moment: Giving up central heating.\\nGreatest fear: Someone asking how great-grandfather made all his money.\\nWhat they wear: Blundstones and thick wool socks.\\nLeast likely to say: \u2018Alexa\u2026\u2019\\nFor a chunk of this year, they were locked down in their country houses with the extended family (plus partners and babies) and TBH they haven\u2019t been as\u00a0happy since that time they lived off the land for a year in Wales when the children were small. Of the many unexpected things they have relished during the last year, the best include: making their own sourdough and pickling; sorting out the garden; painting (the walls); swimming naked in the river; keeping bantams; and empathising regularly with the Extinction Rebellion kids.\\nHow you spot them: Long grey hair (lockdown provided the excuse) and a Keep Cup (still lives in the Bag for Life).\\nProudest moment: Delivering the puppies.\\nGreatest fear: Nick going back to WFW.\\nWhat they wear: Clogs (not new to them). Floppy linen smocked dresses and aprons.\\nLeast likely to say: \u2018I\u2019m with Trump on global warming.\\nShearling clogs, \u00a3135, Birkenstock; Calla dress, \u00a3225, Meadows; Figs apron, \u00a324.95, Emma Bridgewater; Ribbed socks, \u00a325, Cos\\nObviously vegan and non-flyers, they will only buy their clothes from second-hand stores, are bi-curious (in theory; in practice, they just don\u2019t want either persuasion to feel excluded), passionate recyclers and politically engaged. That said, they also take drugs, including the chemical variety, shop on Amazon sometimes, order Ocado (for the dry goods) and consume avocados at a terrifying rate (must we repeat? OK: it takes 2,000 litres of water to produce 1kg of avos). Veganistas would follow through and commit to a totally environmentally watertight lifestyle, but they rely on their single-use contact lenses, need to use the delicate washing cycle (maximum microfibre releaser, if you didn\u2019t know) and the dryer (uh-oh) and the dishwasher and Ubers \u2026\\nHow you spot them: Bose headphones over super-unkempt hair. Mini plaits. Ankle bracelets.\\nProudest moment: Refusing to eat lobster at Hermione\u2019s 21st.\\nGreatest fear: Being outed as having watched the whole of the last series of Love Island .\\nWhat they wear: Second-hand stuff, hand-me-downs from their mum and friends, and Zara.\\nLeast likely to say: \u2018I\u2019ve always liked Boris.\u2019\\nIt\u2019s all about the look, darling. What once was basic hippy attire \u2013 Afghan coat, flares, gilets, bandanas \u2013 are, this season, the must-haves of the cool and affluent woman about town. We\u2019re talking all the hippy elements put through the luxe Hadron Collider, then polished and tweaked and made a lot more the sort of thing Gwyneth Paltrow would love. To be clear,\u00a0luxe hippies are not that clued up about sustainability and so forth. They hate the kids being exposed to polluted air or non-organic food and they do feel kind of hippy because they do their bit for the future of the planet, by attending fundraisers wearing fabulous bohemian dresses \u2013 or at least they were. However, the housekeeper is still changing the towels three times a week, they still have two dishwashers, there is definitely fur in the house (maybe crocodile) and possibly some cocaine.\\nSusanna boots, \u00a3930, Chloe; Jamie jeans, \u00a340, Topshop; Zimmermann embroidered blouse, \u00a3540, Matches Fashion; /satchel, \u00a3695, Mulberry; Fedora, \u00a395, Reiss\\nHow you spot them: By their weed pens.\\nProudest moment: Banning peace lanterns at last year\u2019s New Year party in the country.\\nGreatest fear: Having to age naturally.\\nWhat they wear: Designer bohemian style but always very tight jeans.\\nLeast likely to say: \u2018I\u2019m really loving my new menstrual cup.\u2019\\nThe proud mothers of 20-something Extinction Rebellion supporters and themselves environmental protesters. Their motto is Do Sweat The Small Stuff and they have a permanent air of anxiety about them (why wouldn\u2019t they? We have 10 years, if that), not to mention a lot of guilt, especially for the 1980s when they were fully jet-skiied up and oblivious to the impact of winter sports on the environment.\\nThey do have some Achilles heels, though. They haven\u2019t yet given up the 4x4, for example (the lane to their weekend cottage is practically impassable in anything else), though they feel better about that since installing the hot compost. For the ELHs, every week means making another small step for the general good and they are being the change they want\u00a0to see and encouraging it in their less evolved friends. Also, unlike their kids, they\u2019re trying not to judge (Emma Thompson is doing what she can). Last December\u2019s small Be the Change moment was not buying a real Christmas tree. Everyone felt sad but good at the same time.\\nHow you spot them: Make-up free, harassed-looking, on a bicycle.\\nProudest moment: When they all linked arms and were photographed in Piccadilly last autumn with Benedict Cumberbatch.\\nGreatest fear: Getting an unexpected visit from other Earnests and being shamed for not properly recycling the Nespresso pods.\\nWhat they wear: Toast.\\nLeast likely to say: \u2018Aung San who?\u2019\\nFor more news, analysis and advice from The Telegraph's fashion desk,\u00a0click here\u00a0to sign up to get our weekly newsletter, straight to your inbox every Friday.
