He reproduced an internal SWP memo that urged its members: \u201cGo to your local XR meeting - and get stuck in! XR report that around 30,000 people have joined them in the last few weeks. This means local XR meetings are likely to be big and full of new people.\u201d\\nThe memo urged SWP militants to recruit XR members while at the same time exerting a more socialist influence within the climate change movement, under the slogan \u201cSystem change not climate change\u201d.\\nWriting in the London Left Green Blog page Mr Story warned: \u201cWhile new ideas are definitely required, what XR does NOT need is an outside organisation of experienced and disciplined political operators to enter it with the usual SWP objectives in mind: recruiting new members, manipulation, stirring up disputes and splits, capturing leadership roles and the like.\u201d\\nXR was originally formed in late 2018 by activists involved in direct action groups including Occupy, Plane Stupid and Reclaim the Power. It advocated \u201crevolution,\u201d and redistribution of wealth, and was regarded by senior police officers as being an extremist anarchist group.\\nIts tactics, which began with 6,000 protesters blocking London's five main bridges, have been to cause maximum disruption for short periods using non-violent direct action, with targets ranging from Shell\u2019s headquarters, London Fashion Week, the Stock Exchange and even the Docklands Light Railway.\\nEach target, the group claims, represented organisations that were contributing to the degradation of the environment.\u00a0Such was its support that a number of celebrities, including Emma Thompson, openly featured in their campaigns.\\nActor Benedict Cumberbatch is also one of several stars to have visited the protest sites during previous demonstrations, with others including model Daisy Lowe, comedian Ruby Wax and actors Juliet Stevenson and Mark Rylance.\\nOn Friday night, the group blockaded printing sites that prevented many national newspapers\u00a0 - including The Telegraph - from\u00a0being delivered.\\nYesterday, Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative MP and former Defence Minister, told Times Radio that XR had \"lost sight of how to campaign\".\\nHe said: \"The Government has done much itself but obviously could do more and we need to work with the people to get that message across so we all can be more aware of the carbon footprint that we create.\\n\"But what they're doing here is to alienate more people.

But listening to the MPs led by Sir Keir Starmer, it is difficult not to feel a pang of pity for the man seeking to become our next prime minister.\\nSince he took over his party in April, Sir Keir's political strategy has been clear. He wants to move on from the worst elements of the Jeremy Corbyn years, from the amateurishness of the leader\u2019s office to the anti-Semitism scandals. He wants to push Labour towards moderation, while avoiding a civil war with the now sizeable and influential Left of his party. He wants to avoid making significant policy commitments, and attack the Government\u2019s competence instead.\\nAbove all, Sir Keir knows he must shut down dividing lines with the Tories on cultural issues. He knows it was Brexit, and Labour\u2019s resistance to it, that caused the so-called Red Wall of constituencies to fall to the Conservatives last December. And he knows that Britain\u2019s future relationship with the European Union, and other powerful political issues relating to identity and culture, can still slice in two the coalition of voters he needs to win.\\nLabour are more metropolitan, more cosmopolitan, and more culturally liberal than ever before. But the voters they have lost, and need to win back, are different: provincial, patriotic, and seeking solidarity from their fellow citizens. This explains why Sir Keir is desperate to keep framing the country\u2019s political choice as one about competence and economics.\\nHe can feasibly build a coalition of voters by promising to tax the rich and spend more on services, but his job will be impossible if he appears to want to go back on Brexit, increase immigration, or put the rights of criminal suspects above those of the general public.\\nYet politics is rarely so simple, and no politician, however skilful, can quell the brewing culture war. Political divides on economic issues will of course remain, but divides on cultural issues are also here to stay. This is because, on one hand, cultural conservatives seek respite from incessant change and exposure to the harsh winds of globalisation. On the other, left-wing activists seek ever more radical change, and are increasingly prepared to rely not on the ballot box but disruptive and even violent direct action.\\nAnd so, as Trotsky might have said, Sir Keir may not be interested in the culture war, but the culture war is interested in him. He will be unable to escape it.\\nJust consider the events of the past few days. On Friday, Extinction Rebellion, the anarchists posing as environmentalists, successfully blockaded newspaper printing presses, preventing their circulation to millions of readers. It took Sir Keir until Sunday lunchtime to comment, when he was eventually forced to issue a statement saying the blockade was \u201cwrong and does nothing to tackle climate change\u201d.\\nWhile Labour insists Starmer\u00a0was simply unavailable, it seems more likely that the true cause of the delay was the same dilemma he will face time and again for the duration of his leadership.\\nThe many millions of moderate voters he wants to target deplore criminal behaviour and disruptive direct action. Yet many politicians and activists in the modern Labour Party support it.\\n\u201cBravo, Extinction Rebellion, excellent work,\u201d tweeted Dawn Butler, a Labour MP, on Saturday morning. Another, Zarah Sultana, justified the criminal action on the basis that several newspapers \u201ccampaign for Right-wing policies.\u201d Diane Abbott, until recently the shadow home secretary, compared Extinction Rebellion with the Suffragettes, who, lest we forget, fought not against democracy, but in its favour.\\nAnd Sir Keir\u2019s dilemma does not end there. In June, the Labour leader posed for photographs as he \u201ctook the knee\u201d in solidarity with Black Lives Matter. It was already known that the official Black Lives Matter campaign sought to \u201cdefund\u201d the police, and supported an anti-Semitic boycott of Israel, which it calls an \u201capartheid state\u201d. Only later did Sir Keir make clear that he believes defunding the police is \u201cnonsense\u201d, and when he did so the Left attacked him.\\nOther examples abound. When Priti Patel dared to cite her own experiences of racism, Labour MPs wrote to the Home Secretary accusing her of using her own ethnicity to belittle \u201cthe very real racism faced by black people\u201d. Even though the letter was perceived by Ms Patel to be racist, and one of the signatories was a member of Labour\u2019s front bench team, Sir Keir chose to remain silent.\\nHe remained silent, too, as the dinghies crossing the English Channel caused a new wave of illegal immigration this summer. While the public wanted control, Labour MPs demanded open borders, calling for \u201can immigration system that advances the rights of all working people [and doesn\u2019t] divide us by the colour of our passports\u201d.\\nSir Keir remained silent as the Black Lives Matter protests turned violent on the streets of London, although he spoke up later when Right-wing extremists did the same. He intervened in the Rule Britannia! row only when the BBC announced it would be played at the Last Night of the Proms after all, and even then felt he had to say the song \u201cshould not be a barrier to examining our past\u201d.\\nConsider the beliefs of the MPs he leads, and one can understand why Starmer has concluded silence is the best policy. Opinion research suggests only one in five voters believe Labour is more patriotic than the Conservatives, and even fewer believe Sir Keir is more patriotic than Boris Johnson.\\nBut perpetual silence is not an option for Labour. Sir Keir can do everything he can to keep the public thinking about the competence of the Government, and the economic choices facing the country. But thanks in part to the actions of Labour\u2019s own MPs and activists, Britain\u2019s cultural divide will come to the fore again and again. The dilemma facing Sir Keir means he will be unable to provide a voice for both his party and the voters he needs to become prime minister.\\nNick Timothy is the author of \u2018Remaking One Nation: The Future of Conservatism\u2019", "image": [["Sir Keir is trapped between his party and a socially conservative electorate", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2020/08/12/TELEMMGLPICT000236925492_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7NHwSWcJ9h8nZQjSVtI6vrQ.jpeg?imwidth=680"]], "author": null, "date": "2020-09-06"}, "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/life/10-signs-middle-class-environment-hypocrite/": {"title": "10 signs you\u2019re a middle-class environment hypocrite", "subtitle": "Sir David Attenborough has admitted to eating chicken while telling others to cut down on meat.

Primarily, you have to appear as though your life is prosperous and full \u2013 a hot tub on the decking, an Audi parked in the driveway.\u00a0Yet at the same time, you have to uphold a strong environmental conscience, because nothing says middle class these days like a Farmdrop box and a garden table fashioned\u00a0from ecobricks.\\nIf that sounds like a complex sociological rubric (and really, it is)\u00a0then it\u2019s only fitting that Sir David Attenborough has given it a label: the middle class environment hypocrite. In an interview with Radio Times, Sir David outed himself as a member of this morally confused group \u2013 he\u00a0admitted to \u201cmiddle class hypocrisy\u201d for occasionally eating free-range chicken while urging others to give up meat.\\n\u201cHuman beings have overrun the Earth,\u201d\u00a0he told the magazine. \u201cThe planet can\u2019t support billions of meat eaters.

But he isn\u2019t the only person to fall into the trap of wanting a better world while not always following their own green doctrine.\u00a0Prince William, who this week spoke about how fatherhood has given him \u201ca new sense of purpose\u201d\u00a0to protect the environment, once warned of the dangers of population growth \u2013\u00a0despite having a brood of three children himself. Meanwhile, David Cameron, who wanted to preside over a green evolution while Prime Minister, recently revealed that his daughter\u00a0Nancy, 16, is an environmental activist and wants him to cut down on meat.\\nOnce few and far between, environmental hypocrites are now as common as the discarded face masks that they litter everywhere. Are you\u00a0guilty?\\nGone are the days when it was acceptable to show up outside the school gates in a gas-guzzling Chelsea tractor.

And it\u2019s fine to break your vegetarianism for an organically reared partridge, right?\\nThis eco-hypocrisy was notably displayed by the Duchess of Sussex\u00a0after it was revealed that she decorated her nursery at Frogmore Cottage in the Cotswolds with vegan paint\u00a0(in between taking private jets, of course).\u00a0And in true middle class style, you\u00a0followed suit. \u201cOh, it\u2019s so horrifying how so many household paints use milk or beeswax as a binder \u2013\u00a0those poor insects,\u201d you say, while viciously scraping away the shameful\u00a0remains of Farrow & Ball from the dining room walls.

Most professional sportspeople choose to avoid any semblance of controversy on social media; in stark contrast, Lawes seems to suggest it is his duty to stand up for his beliefs on areas such as marriage and racism.\\nWhen Manchester United and England footballer Marcus Rashford successfully campaigned for free school meals to be extended over the summer holiday, Lawes was targeted for posting a reply espousing the importance of being financially secure and married before having children.\\nWhat has frustrated the 31-year-old was not the personal abuse that followed \u2013 he was called everything from a snob to a moron while others urged his sponsors to drop him \u2013 but the fact that there was no opportunity for reasoned debate to ensue.\\n\u201cI was called all sorts, everything,\u201d the father-of-four says, with a chuckle. \u201cI find it interesting that people resort to slurs and name-calling rather than engaging in an argument.\\n\u201cThat says all it needs to say. It shows maybe the way our culture is going. Everything is so polarised that someone who doesn\u2019t agree with you is now your enemy, they are not just someone who disagrees with you.\\n\"I prefer for people to engage in discourse and discuss why they have differences in opinions and find common ground. But I am fine at sticking my neck out and taking some criticism. If people want to call me names, then crack on. It goes straight over my head. I know who I am and know where I come from. I am perfectly comfortable in my skin.\"\\nLawes believes there are many who would share his views on when to have children.\\n\u201cI am not trying to say that people who have kids should get married, I am trying to say that it is not a bad idea to wait until you are before you have children,\" he explains. \"If you wait until you have got married to have children, then you are much more likely to be in a good position to raise your children.\\n\u201cThat is the argument I am trying to make. I think it makes sense to a lot of people.\\n\"If you want to keep your head down and not take any criticism then I understand why people want to do that. But I am in a position, having come from not a lot, to be able to express why I was able to get where I am today and hope that my experience, and what I think has given me the opportunity, will help other people get that same opportunity.\\n\"I am just trying to do what I can and use the reach I have got to hopefully help people or improve their lives.\u201d\\nThere has been no contact with Rashford since, but Lawes revealed that he had volunteered to deliver free school meals around Northampton only for complications around Covid-19 to cause a delay.\\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been in touch. I am not super well-versed on what he is doing and both sides of the argument,\u201d Lawes adds. \u201cI understand his side of the argument and why he is doing it, but I haven\u2019t had a good look into people who are opposing it and why they are opposing it so I don\u2019t have a well-rounded perspective on exactly what is happening.\\n\u201cBut from what I can see, if children are struggling to be fed, then the country certainly has an obligation to help out there.\\n\u201cI was going to help distribute the school meals over the holidays but that was pushed back because of Covid-19. But I am keen to do anything \u2013 from visiting schools, helping young people from poor backgrounds, talking and being there for people who haven\u2019t got any role models or people to look up to.\u201d\\nHis stance has led some to see him as an \u2018anti-woke\u2019 hero, not afraid to raise concerns about the actions of organisations such as Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion and as an unlikely champion of freedom of speech. That he comes from a mixed- race family and from a working-class background has made his voice more impactful.\\n\u201cTheir arguments are not my thought process,\u201d Lawes adds. \u201cI do not have a revolutionary mindset. I am not a top-down thinker, I am a bottom-up thinker.\u00a0I believe in personal and individual responsibility and if you want collective change, that means individual change on a massive level.\\n\u201cYou do your part as an individual for the collective. That is my thought process in most things. That means that I don\u2019t align with movements who group everybody together and say \u2018Everyone\u2019s experiences are the same and we need change from the top\u2019.\u201d\\nLast December Lawes provoked a reaction on social media by tweeting that \"England is not a racist country\", while he recently argued that players who did not take the knee before matches should not be seen as racist or used as a divisive issue.\u00a0He has experienced racism but insists he believes attitudes in the country have improved significantly since his father Linford arrived from Jamaica as a 12 year-old.\\n\u201cEveryone has very different experiences,\u201d he adds. \u201cI have had negative experiences but I have had mostly positive ones. My experience\u00a0of Britain \u2013 and that of my father \u2013\u00a0is that it is getting a lot better. It is improving and that is the main thing. Things take time. Nothing happens overnight.\u00a0 I understand why people get impatient but sometimes you have to be patient and keep on doing your part and asking others to do theirs.\\n\u201cMy dad is very thankful for the opportunity that living in Britain has given to him and also to me. I think that is what a lot of people are missing \u2013 the opportunities that are here if you are fortunate to be born here and a lot of places on the planet just do not have.\\n\u201cMy dad had a good mum and dad who brought him up to work hard, graft and not worry about what other people were\u00a0saying or thinking about you. They said: \u2018Just do your job and you will get where you want to be\u2019 and he has been able to do that.\u201d\\nAt 31, and with 85 England caps to his name, Lawes, who revealed he set a personal best for speed during the pre-season, has set his sights on making\u00a0a fourth World Cup if he is selected in Eddie Jones\u2019 squad for the tournament in France in 2023.\\nBut given his strong community spirit, one wonders if a career in politics might follow rugby. He is already doing some work with the Centre for Social Justice thinktank and has also been contacted by the Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch to share his opinions. Interestingly, he is not quick to quash the idea.\\n\u201cWe will see,\u201d he adds. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know if I want to go into politics, even if that is a possibility.\\n\u201cAt the minute I am a guy with an opinion who tries to be as best informed as\u00a0I can.\\n\u201cI read a lot and am in touch with some influential people in terms of politics. It is wicked to be able to help and maybe give a different perspective on things.\\n\u201cI am interested in politics but not really interested in debating, like being Conservative or Labour, I am just interested in helping push a different perspective and maybe a different way of people improving their lives. So while that is I guess political, I don\u2019t think it really should be. Helping people in a certain way shouldn\u2019t really be politicised but it just happens that it is at the minute.\\n\u201cI will do whatever I can to help. Some days I wonder if we are getting anywhere but ultimately I am always going to be a positive person \u2014\u00a0an optimist \u2014\u00a0and I won\u2019t be defeated easily.\u201d\\nHis immediate focus however is on Northampton\u2019s Champions Cup quarter-final against Premiership leaders Exeter Chiefs at Sandy Park on Sunday. A dreadful run of results since the restart last month \u2013 including a defeat at Franklin\u2019s Gardens against a second-string Exeter side \u2013 has left them as Lawes describes, \u201cserious underdogs\u201d.\\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to hit the ground running as we hoped,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are quite a free-flowing team and don\u2019t have a massively structured game so we need our players to be in good form and due to lockdown and not playing together for a long time, it has taken us a lot longer to get back on to the same page to fulfil our potential.\\n\u201cWe have got a tough game ahead of us and we are serious underdogs but that is fine.

We were 11, it was 1986 and we were obsessed with Madonna. We stayed up until midnight planning the outfit, referencing my 400-plus posters for inspiration and settled on a bralet, white shirt, wide black sash belt, Lycra skirt, fingerless lace gloves\u2026 you get the picture. We only planned to hit one shop, Tammy Girl.\\nI was reminiscing about this recently and it got me thinking how different my children\u2019s shopping experiences will be, and how my own experiences have changed over the years.\\nWhen I started my career over 20 years ago, the term Fast Fashion barely existed. I worked for Topshop, the leading fashion brand on the high street. We designed, bought, produced and sold the most wanted pieces, at accessible but sensible prices.\\nNegotiations with suppliers felt fair, it was give and take. Margins were achievable, we made a profit and so did they. We were proud of the garments we produced, and the factories they were produced in. We travelled the globe seeking inspiration from remote flea markets, secret vintage dens, private collectors and cool kids on the streets. We sourced premium wools in Italy, exclusive hand-drawn prints in Paris, garments were made from wool, cotton, silk and leather. We were innovative, exciting, the number one go-to for a fashion-loving 16-year-old through to a 40-plus fashion editor. Topshop was the coolest brand in the world. Our flagship in the heart of London\u2019s retail hub in Oxford Circus was the first port of call for any fashionista worth her Guccis; with over 200 new styles arriving every week, a daily visit was essential, or risk missing out on the latest must-have pieces at a fraction of what it would cost you on neighbouring Bond Street.\\nEvery year we smashed our sales plans, the press loved us, our brand loyalty was at an all time high, as was our integrity. We worked crazy hours, every day was different, it was tough and extremely demanding but it was all doable. The parties were insane. Kate Moss worked for us, Jourdan and Cara walked for us. The buzz was incredible and we loved it.\\nOver time, more and more competition entered the high street and existing players upped their game \u2013 Primark became Primarni. Everyone looked to us for their inspiration so we had a maximum of six weeks\u2019 exclusivity before our designs were on the shop floors of all our budget competitors, and so the spiral of speed began. Then of course Zara arrived determined to own a slice of the UK\u2019s Fast Fashion pie. That changed everything. Owning their own factories and a vast global portfolio meant that their buying power was as huge as their pockets were deep. Fiercely competitive on price with lightning speed to market, they threatened everyone.\\nThe whole high street slowly but surely started to unravel like a piece of cheap acrylic knitwear. It wasn\u2019t just increased competition, footfall was dropping as the recession took hold, yet retailers felt they were somehow invincible, expanding too quickly and widely. Many British brands failed overseas, resulting in huge losses, wiping out UK profits.\\nCustomers demanded quicker, faster, cheaper, and we gave it to them. The pressure was overwhelming, it was no longer a fun environment to work in, gone were the sourcing trips to Italy and the premium fabrics, polyester was now a go-to, wool coats were now made from the sweepings off the mill floor, it broke my heart every day.\\nWhen the Rana Plaza disaster happened in 2013 it was a huge wake-up call for the whole industry, and me personally. The demise of the product was heartbreaking, but this was people\u2019s lives. Fashion was meant to be fun and frivolous not life and death. The stress levels, the unrealistic sales forecasts, lack of strategy and loss of brand identity started to form a grip so tight you could physically feel it. The fear was palpable. Sustainability targets seemed like a joke, what was remotely sustainable about any of this?\\nI was beyond uncomfortable by this point but Topshop was like a family, it was my second home, the girls I\u2019d coached from entry level admin assistants were now senior buyers, women with children, my colleagues and friends.\\nI feared leaving them, but ultimately I knew it was wrong, the system was broken and there was no change on the horizon. So in 2018 I made the decision to leave, refuel and find a new way to enjoy fashion, one that would benefit my children\u2019s future rather than damage it.\\nNow when I am sourcing preloved clothes for my own business, The Curatory, I am frequently amazed by the vast volume of unwanted clothes that already exist and wonder if, as a member of Extinction Rebellion said to me last year during a conversation on sustainability and the future of fashion, we really don\u2019t ever need to produce another stitch of clothing.\\nHowever, during that same conversation I also learnt about a leather that is being grown using cellular agriculture. I feel positive that the advances in technology will enable us to continue to enjoy fashion. I feel positive that change is coming \u2013 after all who\u2019d have thought two years ago that the second-hand clothing market is set to be worth $400\u2009 billion globally by 2022?\\nShopping for vintage and second hand is nothing new, but it\u2019s been rebranded and repackaged as preloved. It\u2019s cool and aspirational. There\u2019s no shortage of innovations when it comes to fashion and how we\u2019ll shop in the future; made-to-order, pre-order, clothes swaps, rental, make your own and make do and mend.\\nI\u2019m excited about it, I love the British high street and don\u2019t want to see it wither away. Inside I am still that 11-year-old girl who is excited by fashion, the way it makes me feel, the patterns, the prints, the fabrics and silhouettes. The opportunity fashion gives me to reinvent myself on a daily basis, to find comfort, power and confidence in what I choose to wear. So as Dame Vivienne Westwood says, we need to \u201cshop less and choose well\u201d.\\nFind Jenny\u2019s second-hand edit on Instagram @the.curatory\\nFor more news, analysis and advice from The Telegraph's fashion desk,\u00a0click here\u00a0to sign up to get our weekly newsletter, straight to your inbox every Friday.

As a student in the early Noughties, I helped establish the first green group Reading University ever had; I was involved in the (now disbanded) Camp for Climate Action in my early 20s, protesting against investment in the tar sands industry (which is used to make petroleum products). I lived and breathed a eco-aware lifestyle, and still do: based in Devon with my two young daughters, I don\u2019t drive or fly or eat meat; our carbon footprint is relatively low.\\nBut no group or movement I joined seemed to be making any difference. Carbon emissions were still rising and nothing was changing. Instead, climate change was only getting worse. I was scared we were running out of time to act.\\nThen, about two years ago, Extinction Rebellion (XR) - the group that last weekend blocked the printworks of several British newspapers including The Daily Telegraph - burst into being. It had been some years since I\u2019d been involved with any green group, but what appealed to me about this one was that they were saying \u201cdon\u2019t listen to us, listen to the scientists.\u201d It seemed like this movement was going to be fact-driven and evidence-based, which was badly needed. Yet after almost two years of XR membership, I have quit to campaign for nuclear energy.\\nI had joined in April 2018 aged 34 and became founding editor of its newspaper, The Hourglass, and soon was one of the group\u2019s spokespeople. In the years since my activism days, and after having my first child, I had gone back to university to do a Master\u2019s in Science Communication and was ready to put what I\u2019d learned into action. Joining XR gave me that opportunity: as a spokesperson I found myself front and centre of the media spotlight, speaking to millions of people about the ongoing climate emergency.\\nBut when I was invited onto The Andrew Neil Show last October, I found myself forced to defend statements by one of XR\u2019s founders that \u201cbillions\u201d of deaths would happen soon because of climate change.\\nI couldn\u2019t defend those numbers because they didn\u2019t have a basis in science. So I was faced with an awful choice on live TV: either I could stand up for science or I could defend XR. I had to choose the former, because for me, sticking with the evidence is the most important thing of all.\\nAs a result, I looked bad, and was also then criticised by XR. I felt like I had been thrown under the bus and stopped being a spokeswoman for the group; in May, I edited my final issue of The Hourglass, and left the following month. Some members were supportive but other members reacted negatively - at that point, though, I felt I had no other choice.\\nIt all seemed so unnecessary. Members of XR don\u2019t need to make up numbers - the truth is frightening enough. We are facing a climate emergency: food production will not be able to keep pace with climate heating, and large parts of the globe will be rendered uninhabitable to humans if we allow the temperature to keep on rising.\\nBut the hyperbole of some key XR people wasn\u2019t the group\u2019s only problem. It had grown quickly and was making organisational errors, which is understandable given the pace of events, but did affect the movement\u2019s reputation. When activists targeted the London transport network on October 17, angry commuters were prevented from travelling to work by protesters who\u2019d climbed on to the roof of a train at Canning Town station. At Shadwell, other activists blocked the Docklands Light Railway. This was the work of a separate climate group protesting under the broad XR banner.\\nTargeting electricity-powered public transport was of course seen as a terrible idea for a green movement, and the backlash it provoked was inevitable. Many of us inside XR knew it was unwise, but there\u2019d been little time to discuss it before the action went ahead, and no real process for dealing with the fall-out.\\nThe recent action aimed at the press has proved equally controversial. I have a lot of sympathy with those concerned about protecting freedom of speech and of the press: those are my values too.\\nXR gets heavily criticised for not appealing to more people. But they would argue they\u2019ve achieved their aims because everyone\u2019s been talking about it.\\nI understand this ambition to force a conversation, but from my perspective it won\u2019t change anything unless you can bring about concrete solutions. And that is the single biggest problem with most environmental groups: they don\u2019t offer realistic solutions to the very real climate change threat. What they offer, if you follow their arguments to their logical conclusion, is eco-austerity: that we should all use less energy, stop going on holiday, live in colder homes, and so on.\\nWe simply don\u2019t have time to go on having pointless ideological debates. And even if we agree to permanent eco-austerity in Western countries, what about the developing world? There are some members of environmental groups who truly believe we should live extremely constrained lifestyles, much like people in the Punjab village my parents are from. I have spent time there and it was heartbreaking. In many villages in the region they have no electricity and no infrastructure. Children die from health problems we in the West can easily cure.\\nSome of those who promote an eco-austerity agenda will tell you, \u201cThey live simpler lives so they\u2019re happy.\u201d Believe me: they are not. My parents never once looked back after leaving for the UK. They, like everyone, wanted the vaccines and hospitals and technology we have in the West. People who argue we need to all live with less - as I once did - should think hard about what this actually means. I am personally happy to live with less, but decades of behavioural science study has not convinced most people to take the same path. We need to accept it\u2019s not going to happen, and look to solutions instead.\\nMany within XR argue in favour of replacing fossil fuels entirely with renewables. I favour a pragmatic approach, rather than peer-group tribal pressure to stick to an outdated mainstream green line. Once you demand that all our power must come from wind and solar, you seriously constrain our options to achieve net zero carbon emissions in the timescale required. To make a serious contribution to decarbonising the UK economy, solar parks would need to cover whole counties, and wind farms dominate most of our coastline and uplands. With less or even no nuclear energy, we would need to devote even more of our land to industrial scale renewables, leaving much less for farming and nature.\\nThere won\u2019t be any space for rewilding in this scenario. This is not a trade-off that can be avoided by bluster and belief. This needs to be an evidence-based and numbers-focused debate, not an ideological one.\\nUnfortunately much of the green movement, including a fair proportion of those in XR, is steeped in an anti-nuclear mindset, when any rational, evidence-based approach shows that a strategy including nuclear energy is the only realistic solution to driving down emissions at the scale and speed required.\\nMy values haven\u2019t changed. I care deeply about the same issues I\u2019ve always cared about. So it\u2019s not a U-turn, but a logical next step to devote myself to looking more at solutions than shouting ever more loudly about the problem.\\nStunts and protests are a popular campaigning tool. But the environmental message needs to be followed up with real solutions.\\nAs told to Rosa Silverman", "image": [["Zion Lights: 'No group or movement I joined seemed to be making any difference'", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/women/2020/09/09/TELEMMGLPICT000238926478_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqW56fdpnN__FP85isYsc1gYkxVU4kYB2YOi7_AYgk8JA.jpeg?imwidth=680"], ["Zion Lights: 'Members of XR don\u2019t need to make up numbers - the truth is frightening enough'", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/women/2020/09/09/TELEMMGLPICT000238926208_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNoGXySPv9M1Jbe0Fc3Bi1Fk.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["Extinction Rebellion protesters demonstrate outside Parliament on September 9, 2020", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/women/2020/09/09/TELEMMGLPICT000238915695_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqOTom2IDArMR5JububTrAx-tnFTrpsYaAoL1DebmRBSo.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["Police officers stand next to activists taking part in an Extinction Rebellion protest in Westminster, on September 8, 2020", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/women/2020/09/09/TELEMMGLPICT000238837132_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqIkUhv7k5mil0w0oeVCztIhVrDwi3LvLa62XQyE1Z5U4.jpeg?imwidth=350"]], "author": ["Zion Lights", "Ella Nunn", "David Christopher Kaufman ", "Emily Peck", "Claire Allfree", "Laura Donnelly", "Simon Johnson"], "date": "2020-09-10"}}
