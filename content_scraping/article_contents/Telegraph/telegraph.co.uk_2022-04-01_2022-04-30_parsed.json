At least Lloyd George always made sure he had some money in the bank.\\nTim Stanley: Why Boris will not yield to pressure to resign\\nSue Gray\u2019s report\u00a0into illegal Downing Street gatherings is set to be published as early as next week, when MPs return to Parliament, it can be revealed.\\nSources have told The Telegraph that the report will be critical of\u00a0Boris Johnson\u2019s conduct\u00a0and make\u00a0\"uncomfortable reading\" for him\u00a0and a number of senior Whitehall figures.\\nA source said: \"The delay in publishing the Sue Gray report has been a\u00a0cause of much frustration. But now that the bulk of the police investigation is complete, it is important\u00a0the findings are made public\u00a0as soon as possible so that everything can be as transparent as possible.\\n\"The details contained in the report will make very uncomfortable reading for Boris Johnson and for a number of other key figures in Whitehall. The issuing of\u00a0fixed penalty notices\u00a0by the police is certainly not the end of the matter.\"\\n\u200bMartin Evans has the full story\\nA leadership contest that took three months would risk \"a lame duck Prime Minister while the world is in crisis\", one of Boris Johnson's harshest critics has said.\\nSir Roger Gale, who submitted a letter of no confidence after the row over Dominic Cummings's trip to Durham in the first lockdown, called on Mr Johnson to resign back in January.\\nBut speaking to Sky News this evening, he said: \"We have a role to play internationally and we are playing it, because of people like, yes, Ben Wallace and the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary and others.\\n\"We I think are playing a very significant role and I don't want to see that role destabilised, I don't want to see the European and the international coalition destabilised to the detriment of the people of Ukraine.\"\\nAhead of the local elections next month, Sir Roger admitted that 'partygate' \"certainly wasn't going to help\" matters but alluded to other significant issues like planning and the cost-of-living crisis that will decide matters at the ballot box.\\nMark Spencer, the Leader of the Commons, has become the latest member of Boris Johnson's administration to lend his support to the PM and Rishi Sunak.\\n\"The PM has apologised and taken responsibility for what happened in Downing Street,\" he said - one of many statements this evening to reference Mr Johnson's apology at the end of January, when Sue Gray published her interim findings.\\n\"He and the Chancellor are delivering a growing economy during global challenges and delivering on the international security crisis we face.\\n\"They have my whole support.\"\\nHe may have left it a bit later to break his silence - but much like Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak isn't going anywhere.\\nJust over two months ago, the Chancellor answered with a firm \"no\" when asked by Sky News whether he believed he had broken lockdown rules.\\nBut after the Met reached a different conclusion as part of its ongoing 'partygate' probe, Mr Sunak apologised twice in a 109-word statement.\\n\"I understand that for figures in public office, the rules must be applied stringently in order to maintain public confidence,\" he said.\u00a0\"I respect the decision that has been made and have paid the fine.\"\\nBut the most telling aspect of his\u00a0mea culpa\u00a0was its final line: \"Like the Prime Minister, I am focused on delivering for the British people at this challenging time.\"\\nThis is a Chancellor who despite weeks of negative publicity does not seem to be going anywhere. Whether he can bounce back from his recent travails, which his neighbour at No 10 has done habitually throughout his career, remains to be seen.\\nAs the Prime Minister is fined for attending parties during lockdown, we go back to where it all began and see how the drama unfolded.\\n\u200bMason Boycott-Owen has this timeline\\nThe Chancellor's statement:\\nI can confirm I have received a Fixed Penalty Notice from the Metropolitan Police with regards to a gathering held on 19th June in Downing Street. I offer an unreserved apology.  I understand that for figures in public office, the rules must be applied stringently in order to maintain public confidence. I respect the decision that has been made and have paid the fine.  I know people sacrificed a great deal during Covid, and they will find this situation upsetting. I deeply regret the frustration and anger caused and I am sorry. Like the Prime Minister, I am focused on delivering for the British people at this challenging time.\\nAngela Rayner has described the silence we're seeing from Rishi Sunak tonight as \"bizarre\".\\nShe told the PA news agency: \"After a week of torrid headlines for the Chancellor, you would think he might have something to say to the British public.\\n\"While people made huge sacrifices and followed the rules, Rishi Sunak broke the law. He should resign.\"\\nAnd the deputy Labour leader put it even more bluntly on Twitter:\\nThat there is a debate about whether Boris Johnson can continue in office \u2013 after\u00a0being fined\u00a0for breaking lockdown laws; attending events he variously denied existed, expressed anger about, or excused with implausible explanations; and having been shown to have misled Parliament \u2013 shows the full erosion of standards in our public life, writes Nick Timothy.\\nThe lockdown laws were unprecedented and imposed by the PM himself.\\n\"Look her in the eyes,\" warned a government poster showing a woman on a ventilator, \"and tell her you never bend the rules.\" Millions missed funerals, births and precious time with their families.\\n\"The rules were followed at all times,\" was just one misleading claim Johnson made in Parliament. But there is no chance of the PM doing the honourable thing.\\nNick Timothy: The PM has broken the very rules he imposed\\nWhatever the initial public mood may suggest\u00a0(see 7.42pm), Boris Johnson can always count on the loyal support of Nadine Dorries.\\nAfter she became the first Cabinet minister to show her support, she's been back on Twitter in the last few minutes, this time with a dig at Sir Keir Starmer and high praise for the Government's 'living with Covid' strategy.\\nMore than six in 10 Britons think Boris Johnson should resign after he received a fine over 'partygate', new polling has shown.\\nSixty-one per cent of people want the Prime Minister to quit but only 10 per cent actually think he will, research by Savanta ComRes for the New Statesman shows.\\nAnd Mr Johnson's pledge to get on with the job earlier this evening would appear to vindicate the latter point of view.\\nIn the case of Rishi Sunak, who we are still yet to hear from, 59 per cent think that he should resign, while just 15 per cent think he will.\\nSeparate polling from Opinium earlier today painted a similar picture, with 58 per cent thinking Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak should go.\\nAmong Conservative voters, however, 64 per cent think Mr Johnson should continue as Prime Minister, with just 27 per cent willing him to walk.\\nWe understand from our Associate Editor Christopher Hope\u00a0that Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, has paid the fixed penalty notice he received for breaking lockdown laws at a party in the Cabinet room in 10 Downing Street.\\nThat's what Treasury sources are telling him - but we're yet to have any formal statement from the Chancellor. Eyes peeled...\\nThis just in from the BEIS secretary in the last couple of minutes:\\nTherese Coffey, the Work and Pensions Secretary, has insisted it is \"important for the country\" that Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak remain in place.\\n\"After the Sue Gray report, the PM came to Parliament. As he said the, he is sorry and made recommended changes.\"\\nExpect not just the size of the current majority, but the scale of current and future challenges, to feature\u00a0heavily in the Government's defences of Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak.\\n... and then two come along at once, this one courtesy of Michael Gove, the Housing, Levelling Up and Communities Secretary.\\nMr Johnson's one-time leadership rival writes that he agrees \"100 per cent\" with Simon Clarke, the Treasury minister, that \"the PM and Chancellor deserve our full support\".\\n\"They made the right calls on the big issues and I\u2019ve seen them work tirelessly for this country,\" he said on Twitter.\\n\"Lessons have been learnt and now our focus must be on the huge global challenges we all face.\"\\nBoris Johnson has set out his stall by repeating his apology\u00a0to the British people while remaining optimistic - as No 10 has all along -\u00a0that he will be able to ride this out and move on to what he terms the \"people's priorities\".\\nWe're still waiting to hear from Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, who also received a fixed penalty notice today to cap off what has been a tumultuous few weeks over at No 11.\\nThe start of last week was dominated by a row over the tax status of Akshata Murty, Mr Sunak's wife, who eventually confirmed that she will start paying UK tax on all her worldwide income after a backlash over her non-domicile status.\\nFresh questions were then posed about the Chancellor's own financial affairs as it was confirmed that he held a green card, documentation that is normally for permanent residents of the US, while in his current post. It all felt like quite a transformation in the political fortunes of someone once seen as an inevitable successor to the PM.\\nSources close to the Chancellor would go on to brief Sunday newspapers\u00a0that Mr Sunak had considered quitting the Cabinet last week. And Mr Sunak's response tonight - assuming that it comes tonight - will say it all about where he sees his future.\\nThe Labour leader has just told reporters:\\nMy thoughts are with all of those who did the right thing and for whom this is a real slap in the face.  They made the most unimaginable, heartwrenching sacrifices and many were overcome by guilt in not seeing elderly relatives, not going to funerals or weddings or even seeing the birth of their own children.\\nBut the guilty men are the Prime Minister and the Chancellor. They've dishonoured all of that sacrifice, they've dishonoured their office.  This is the first time in the history of our country that a Prime Minister has been found to be in breach of the law. And then he lied, repeatedly, to the public about it. Britain deserves better. They have to go.\\nThis time from Treasury minister Simon Clarke, including for his boss at No 11...\\nThe PM and Chancellor have my full support. Their efforts during the pandemic have ensured the UK is now free of restrictions and avoided economic catastrophe.  I\u00a0for one am grateful to them for everything they have done for our country.  The PM has apologised and accepted the police's decision today. He has accepted Sue Gray's recommendations in full and instituted a comprehensive programme of reform in No 10. It's time to get on with the job of governing at a crucial time at home and abroad.\\nFollowing confirmation that Boris Johnson is being fined as part of the 'partygate' scandal, Sam Hall\u00a0explains the law behind the process.\\nA failure to comply with coronavirus regulations is a summary offence.\\nSuch offences usually involve less serious cases, such as motoring offences and minor assaults, where the defendant is not usually entitled to trial by jury.\\nAn offender would face criminal prosecution\u00a0only if a fixed penalty notice for a Covid breach was unpaid\u00a0after 28 days and the relevant police force decided to prosecute.\\nHere is your full guide to the letter of the law\\n\\nFrom what we've just seen, Boris Johnson is hoping\u00a0his comments at Chequers will draw a line under an episode that has posed the biggest threat to his premiership to date.\\nRepeating his apology to the public, Mr Johnson acknowledged his Government introduced unprecedented limits on the freedom of Britons - asking us all to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives - only for parties and gatherings to take place at the centre of power at the same time.\\n\"I have to say in good frankness at that time it did not occur to me that this might have been a breach of the rules,\" the PM said. After the fallout of the next few days, we will get a flavour of whether the public is convinced by this at next month's local elections.\\nPhase one of 'partygate' feels like something of a distant memory. For all the intrigue over Sue Gray's update and memes about being \"ambushed by cake\", the political landscape changed irreversibly at the end of February by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, so much so that some backbenchers no longer care about it at all.\\nIt was only on Saturday that aides to President Volodymyr Zelensky describe the UK as \"the leader in the defence support of Ukraine\". Mr Johnson has won the admiration and support of his MPs, many of whom were incandescent about partying at the start of the year, by taking the lead on financial sanctions and defensive support.\\nBut while the party may not be over for the Prime Minister, there are other difficulties at hand. His pledge to deal with the cost-of-living crisis is significant - but his response will be more significant still.\\nNadhim Zahawi, the Education Secretary, has signalled his support for the Prime Minister by retweeting this clip of Mr Johnson's apology:\\nIt goes without saying that many on the Labour benches are unconvinced.\\n\"How am I meant to trust that he has paid the fine?\" asked Jess Phillips, the MP for Birmingham Yardley.\u00a0\"Why am I to believe this statement and not the many others in parliament and on filmed interviews when he said the opposite?\"\\nCatherine McKinnell, a\u00a0Labour backbencher, wrote: \"How can you make rules for the country and then it not even occur to you to follow them yourself? Apology and paid fine seriously not cutting it.\"\\nPressed on whether he lied about all rules being followed, Boris Johnson insists he was speaking in \"good faith\".\\n\"I didn't occur to me that I was in breach of the rules. I now humbly accept that I was. But I think the best thing I can do now, having settled the fine, is focus on the job in hand, that's what I'm going to do.\"\\nHe says that if more fines are coming his way, \"I'm sure you will be the first to know\".\\nWhen asked if he will resign, Boris Johnson says he has \"of course paid the FPN and I apologise once again for the mistake I made\".\\n\"I want to get on and deliver the mandate that I have but also tackle the problems that the country must face right now and get on with delivering for the people of this country. That is my priority.\"\\nAsked about breaking his own rules, he says it is \"his job to get on\".\\nOn whether he takes responsibility for the culture in Downing Street, Mr Johnson responds: \"I take full responsibility for everything, but don't forget that Downing Street is about 15,000 square feet, it's got a lot of officials working in it, hundreds and hundreds of officials. I couldn't be everywhere at once.\\n\"But clearly once it became obvious what had been happening, the types of behaviour unfortunately, sadly that we've seen, we've taken steps to change things. Downing Street has been radically transformed, it's a very different organisation and we're focussing 100 per cent on delivering our agenda.\"\\n\"I feel an even greater sense of obligation to deliver on the priorities of the British people, strengthening our economy, creating jobs and opportunity, levelling up across the whole of the United Kingdom, now of course ensuring that Putin fails in Ukraine and easing the burden on hardworking families caused by higher energy families.\\n\"I will take forward that task with due humility, but with maximum determination to fulfil my duty and do what is best for the country I serve.\"\\nSpeaking at Chequers, Boris Johnson says:\\n\"Today I've received a fixed penalty notice from the Metropolitan Police relating to an event on June 19, 2020. Let me say immediately that I have paid the fine and I once\u00a0again offer a full apology. And in a spirit of openness and humility I want to be completely clear about what happened on that date.\\n\"My day began shortly at 7am and I chaired eight meetings in No 10 including the Cabinet Committee deciding Covid strategy. I visited a school in Hemel Hempstead which took me out of Downing Street for over four hours.\\n\"And among all these engagements on the day that happened to my birthday, there was a brief gathering in the Cabinet Room shortly after 2pm lasting for less than 10 minutes during which people I work with kindly passed on their good wishes. And I have to say in good frankness at that time it did not occur to me that this might have been a breach of the rules.\\n\"But of course the police have found otherwise and I fully respect the outcome of their investigation. I understand the anger that many will feel that I myself fell short when it came to observing the very rules that the Government I lead had introduced to protect the public and I accept in all sincerity that people had the right to expect better.\"\\nKelly Tolhurst, the MP for Rochester & Strood, echoes the sentiments of Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross in her most recent tweet:\\nThe Prime Minister has apologised, accepted responsibility & made changes accordingly in No10.  This is not the time to change our leader. His focus must be on what\u2019s happening in Ukraine and dealing with the cost of living challenges our country and people are facing.\\nWhen Boris Johnson met Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine,\u00a0on the streets of Kyiv at the weekend, Ukraine's parliament declared to the rest of the world: \"Be brave like Boris\",\u00a0writes Camilla Tominey.\\nThe trip was billed as primarily benefiting Ukraine in its hour of need \u2013 but the Prime Minister needed the visit just as much as the war-torn nation.\\nFor if it hadn't been for Ukraine, and to a lesser extent the cost-of-living crisis,\u00a0news of Mr Johnson's fine for breaking the Covid lockdown rules he set\u00a0would arguably have been enough to finish him off.\\nThe Prime Minister has been having a good war \u2013 even if news that he and Rishi Sunak, his Chancellor, are being issued with fixed penalty notices means he has lost the battle on the home front.\\nCamilla Tominey: A Downing Street scandal like no other\\nAway from the pinata in the room, Downing Street has issued a readout of Boris Johnson's call with President Joe Biden on Ukraine this afternoon.\\n\"The Prime Minister updated President Biden on his recent visit to Kyiv, and said he had been humbled by President Zelenskyy\u2019s strength and resolve,\" a spokesman said.\\n\"The leaders discussed the need to accelerate assistance to Ukraine, including bolstering military and economic support, as the Ukrainian forces prepare for another Russian onslaught in the east of the country.\\n\"The Prime Minister paid tribute to the US\u2019 colossal military contribution to Ukraine, and updated on the UK\u2019s new package of support, including anti-ship missiles and military vehicles, which would arrive in the coming days and weeks.\\n\"Both leaders were clear that Putin would never be able to hold down the spirit of the Ukrainian people, despite his monstrous attempts.\"\\nMr Johnson urged a \"long-term commitment\" to the country and agreed with Mr Biden on joint efforts to \"ratchet up the economic pressure\" on the Putin regime, the spokesman added.\\nThe Prime Minister has \"already apologised\" for June 19 but will \"understand [the] renewed anger\" among the public, one of his close allies has said.\\nIn his tweet, Conor Burns, a Northern Ireland minister, urges the Government to focus on \"delivery\" - a theme that was supposed to be a major facet of No 10's response to the initial scandal over the winter as it looked to rebuild.\\nMichael Fabricant,\u00a0one of the most staunch Boris Johnson loyalists, has said that some of his constituents feel \"very, very strongly\" about the Downing Street parties.\\nBut in an interview with Sky, Mr Fabricant insisted that Mr Johnson will have thought he was acting within the coronavirus rules that were in place at the time.\\n\"Having a quiet drink after 12 or 18 hours' work is not what I call partying, it's what I call unwinding,\" he said.\\n\"If he had been spreading the disease then he would have not only been breaking the rules and I would be calling for his resignation, he would also have been reckless with other people's lives.\\n\"But that wasn't the case, was it? He was only meeting with people he'd been working with constantly throughout the day anyway.\"\\nCarrie Johnson has apologised \"unreservedly\" after she also received a fixed penalty notice in relation to her husband's \"birthday party\" in the Cabinet room on June 19, 2020.\\n\"Mrs Johnson has paid a Fixed Penalty Notice relating to a gathering on the afternoon of 19 June 2020,\" a spokesman for Mrs Johnson said.\\n\"Whilst she believed that she was acting in accordance with the rules at the time, Mrs Johnson accepts the Metropolitan Police\u2019s findings and apologises unreservedly.\"\\nPer Jack's kind words (see 5.31pm), it's me in the driving seat for the rest of the day.\\nAs our Associate Editor\u00a0Christopher Hope\u00a0writes, Government sources are NOT expecting Rishi Sunak to resign tonight:\\nApparently the Chancellor might say something after the Prime Minister has issued his statement.  Tory MPs say he has recorded a video statement to be issued shortly.\\nAs for Mr Johnson, we can expect to hear from him in the hour, as his ministers begin to emerge from the blocks in defence of the PM. Watch this space.\\nI will now be handing over to my excellent colleague Dominic Penna who will guide you through the key developments in the coming hours.\\nYouGov has just published some snap polling on the \"partygate\" scandal.\\nThe company found a majority of people - 57 per cent - believe Boris Johnson should resign after it emerged he is receiving a fine.\\nThat number includes 25 per cent of Conservative voters.\\nThe same proportion - 57 per cent - believe Rishi Sunak should resign. That includes 30 per cent of Tory voters.\\nThree quarters of people (75 per cent) believe Mr Johnson \"knowingly lied about breaching Covid-19 rules\".\\n\\nThe Telegraph has been told that Boris Johnson will be making a statement on his fine inside the hour.\\nJames Duddridge, the Tory MP for\u00a0Rochford and Southend East, serves as Boris Johnson's parliamentary private secretary.\\nHe has just tweeted that he believes Mr Johnson \"is the right person to lead the party and the country\".\\nHe said:\u00a0\"The PM should focus on Ukraine and delivering for the people of the UK. He is the right person to lead the party and the country. The PM has apologised and accepted responsibility. We need to be united in our resolve and move forward under his leadership.\"\\nIt feels somewhat unusual that we haven't seen a cascade of Tory MPs supporting Boris Johnson this afternoon, after the news that he is going to be\u00a0fined, writes Tony Diver, The Telegraph's Whitehall Correspondent.\\nNormally when bad news comes out for No10, loyalist backbenchers are queuing up to defend the Prime Minister - perhaps with the hope of being given a job at the next reshuffle.\\nCould it be that all the Tory MPs have turned against him? One\u00a0Whitehall source has a different theory: That Conservatives don't want to lose face defending Mr Johnson this time, only to find out later that he has also broken the law at an even more raucous event and be forced to defend that too.\\n\"From an MP's point of view, maybe some will be hesitant to defend on this one, because they will feel silly if something much less excusable comes out, like a p***-up in the flat,\" the source said.\\n\"What I'm worried about is whether this leads to, every 48 hours, a new No 10 fixed penalty notice.\"\\nLabour has backed calls for Parliament to return from recess early in light of the \"partygate\" developments.\\nA party spokesman\u00a0said: \u201cBoris Johnson promised he would give a statement to the House of Commons, so we want to hear from the Prime Minister at the earliest possible opportunity to give him the chance to correct his lies and tender his resignation.\\n\u201cObviously it is only the Government who actually has the power to ask the Speaker to recall Parliament.\u201d\\nThe Liberal Democrats have already called for Parliament to be recalled (see the post below at 14.10). MPs are currently due to return to Westminster on Tuesday next week.\\nDowning Street has just issued a statement, detailing which event Boris Johnson's fine relates to.\\nA No 10 spokesman said: \u201cThe Met Police have now explained that the FPN issued to the PM will be in relation to the following incident: \u201cOn 19th June 2020 at the Cabinet room 10 Downing Street\u00a0between 1400 and 1500 you participated in a gathering of two or more people indoors in the Cabinet room at\u00a010 Downing Street.\u201d\\nMichael Fabricant, the Conservative MP for Lichfield, has told BBC News he believes Boris Johnson \"has got to apologise\".\\nHe said:\u00a0\u201cIt has been a long time coming and now it has come. I think a lot of people anticipated that this was going to happen when the whole 'partygate' as it was known as broke out.\\n\u201cI think now the Prime Minister has got to think hard. I think he should certainly go and make a statement to the House of Commons on Tuesday and I think he has got to apologise.\\n\u201cHaving said that I don\u2019t think that at any time he thought that he was breaking the law.\u201d\\nChristopher Hope, The Telegraph's Associate Editor, writes:\\nParliament is almost certainly not going to be recalled before it officially comes back on Tuesday, despite what the Liberal Democrats want (see the post below at 14.10).\\nThis is because it is up to either the Prime Minister Boris Johnson or Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg to order the recall.\\nThe Speaker will oblige if he is asked. One Parliamentary source says: \"I can't see\u00a0them rushing back.\"\\nDouglas Ross, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, has issued a statement in which he said \"it wouldn't be right to remove the Prime Minister at this time\" because of the war in Europe.\\nMr Ross had earlier this year called for Mr Johnson to quit before backtracking.\\nHe said in his statement:\u00a0\"The public are rightly furious at what happened in Downing Street during the pandemic. I understand why they are angry and share their fury. The behaviour was unacceptable. The Prime Minister now needs to respond to these fines being issued.\\n\"However, as I've made very clear, in the middle of war in Europe, when Vladimir Putin is committing war crimes and the UK is Ukraine's biggest ally, as President Zelensky said at the weekend, it wouldn't be right to remove the Prime Minister at this time.\\n\u201cIt would destabilise the UK Government when we need to be united in the face of Russian aggression and the murdering of innocent Ukrainians.\"\\nTory MPs are now trying to process what the \u201cpartygate\u201d fines could mean for the political futures of Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak.\\nThe general consensus from the handful I have spoken to is that it is too early to make firm predictions but some believe the Ukraine crisis has changed the dynamic.\\nOne said they believe the \u201ctemperature within the party has cooled and he [the PM] is probably secure unless it is something particularly horrendous\u201d, adding: \u201cLosing the PM over a slice of cake is something most people would not think is very sensible.\u201d\\nAnother said \u201cwe do not want to change the PM at this moment if we can possibly avoid it\u201d because of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. They said it is \u201ctoo early to say\u201d if the PM will stay or go.\\nAnother said they believe what happens next will depend on what Mr Sunak does. If the Chancellor was to quit then the PM\u2019s fate may also be sealed.\\nSir Roger Gale, the Tory MP for North Thanet, said now is\u00a0not the time to \u201cunseat\u201d the Prime Minister.\\nHe had called for the PM to quit earlier this year.\\nHe said: \"It\u2019s serious of course. My position remains that the fact that the Prime Minister has effectively misled the House of Commons is a very serious issue indeed, but we are in the middle of an international crisis and I am not prepared to give Vladimir Putin the comfort of thinking that we are about to unseat the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and destabilise the coalition against Putin.\\n\u201cSo any reaction to this is going to have to wait until we have dealt with the main crisis which is Ukraine and the Donbas.\u201d\\nThe Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group has said there is \"simply no way either the Prime Minister or Chancellor can continue\" in their roles and \"if they had any decency they would be gone by tonight\".\\nLobby Akinnola, a spokesperson for the group, said:\u00a0\"After everything that\u2019s happened it\u2019s still unbelievably painful to know that the Prime Minister was partying and breaking his own lockdown rules \u2013 while we were unable to be at our loved ones' sides in their dying moments, or in miserable funerals with only a handful of people \u2013 because we were following the rules.\\n\"The fact that the Prime Minister and his Chancellor then lied about it, and would have continued to do so if the police hadn\u2019t intervened, is truly shameless. They broke the law. But even worse, they took us all for mugs.\"\\nNicola Sturgeon tweeted: \"Boris Johnson must resign. He broke the law and repeatedly lied to parliament about it.\\n\"The basic values of integrity and decency - essential to the proper working of any parliamentary democracy - demand that he go. And he should take his out of touch chancellor with him.\"\\nCarrie Johnson, the Prime Minister\u2019s wife, is to be fined over Covid lockdown parties in Downing Street, the Telegraph can reveal.\\nA spokeswoman for Mrs Johnson said that she had been told she would receive a fixed penalty notice.\\nThe statement came after No 10 said Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak are also to be fined over \"partygate\".\\nThe spokeswoman for the Prime Minister\u2019s wife said: \u201cIn the interests of transparency, Mrs Johnson can confirm she has been notified that she will receive a Fixed Penalty Notice (FPN). She has not yet received any further details about the nature of the FPN.\u201d\\nYou can read the full story here.\\nSir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader,\u00a0has called on both the Prime Minister and Chancellor to resign.\\nSir Keir tweeted: \u201cBoris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have broken the law and repeatedly lied to the British public. They must both resign.\\n\u201cThe Conservatives are totally unfit to govern. Britain deserves better.\u201d\\nA No 10 spokesman\u00a0said: \u201cThe Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer have today received notification that the Metropolitan Police intend to issue them with fixed penalty notices.\\n\"We have no further details, but we will update you again when we do.\u201d\\nA millionaire Conservative environmental adviser is facing calls to quit after he said that he stood \"with Extinction Rebellion\" over its protests at oil refineries.\\nBen Goldsmith, a board member at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, criticised Labour for its call for \"injunctions\" to\u00a0stop Extinction Rebellion's disruption, saying it was \"not a good look\".\\nHe then added: \"The protestors are right to be doing whatever it takes to wake people up. The fossil fuel industry is grubby and dangerous.\\n\"We need to unhook ourselves from our dependence asap [as soon as possible]. I'm with Extinction Rebellion.\"\\nMr Goldsmith, a millionaire financier, is also chairman of the Conservative Environment Network, and is the brother of Environment minister Lord Goldsmith of Richmond Park.\\nYou can read the story in full here.\\nToday\u2019s announcement by the Metropolitan Police that it is issuing at least another 30 fines over the \u201cpartygate\u201d scandal, taking the total to more than 50, will reignite the row over Covid rule-breaking in Downing Street and pile the pressure back onto Boris Johnson.\\n\u201cPartygate\u201d had died down as a story in Westminster in recent weeks as the PM was able to concentrate on his response to the Ukraine crisis while he watched his neighbour, Rishi Sunak, face days of negative headlines over his financial arrangements.\\nThe update from Scotland Yard will be seized upon by Mr Johnson\u2019s political opponents who will be keen to return to the subject as they try to inflict as much damage as possible on the PM. The next few days are likely to follow the same pattern as those which followed the announcement at the end of March that 20 fines were being issued: There will be intense speculation about who may have received the fines and the inevitable questions about whether Mr Johnson is one of them.\\nDowning Street has said it will publicly disclose if Mr Johnson (or Simon Case, the Cabinet Secretary) is fined but everyone else will be under no obligation to say if they have been hit with a fixed penalty notice.\\nIf Mr Johnson is one of the recipients of the fines, the scandal is likely to explode and reach an entirely new level of ferocity as critics renew demands for him to quit and some Tory MPs potentially consider whether it is time for a change in leadership.\\nIf the PM is not one of the people fined, then Downing Street will simply try to soak up the pressure while insisting it will comment in full once the Met has completely finished its probe.\\nIt is difficult to predict exactly what will happen next but today\u2019s Met update is exactly what many Tory MPs will have feared: A drip drip of bad news which risks eroding confidence in Mr Johnson\u2019s premiership.\\nSir Keir Starmer has claimed Boris Johnson no longer has the \"authority to govern\" after the Metropolitan Police announced it is issuing at least 30 more \"partygate\" fines.\\nSpeaking from a campaign visit in Glasgow, Sir Keir said:\u00a0\u201cMy position on the Prime Minister hasn\u2019t changed. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s any longer got the authority to govern.\\n\u201cYou can\u2019t ask the country to comply with very difficult Covid rules whilst you\u2019re breaking them in your own home and in your own workplace \u2013 that\u2019s been my position for some months now.\\n\u201cThese fines just underscore how wrong the Prime Minister was to pretend to the country \u2013 and hope that it would never be found out \u2013 that nothing had gone on in his home or in his workplace that broke the law when we now know there was widespread criminality.\u201d\\nAngela Rayner, the deputy leader of the Labour Party, has now responded to the \"partygate\" update from the Metropolitan Police.\\nShe said in a statement:\u00a0 \u201cCrime is soaring, victims are being let down, and police officers are disappearing from our streets \u2013 now we see widespread criminality at the heart of Downing Street.\\n\"This is just the latest example of a distracted out-of-touch government, guilty of breaking the law, never mind enforcing it.\"\\nMs Rayner said that \u201cBritain deserves better than this government\".\\nFrances O'Grady has announced she is stepping down as general secretary of the Trade Unions Congress (TUC) after nine years at the helm.\\nMs O\u2019Grady said she will leave her post at the end of the year, with a replacement elected at the TUC\u2019s annual meeting in September.\\nThe trade union chief was first elected to the position in 2013, making her the first woman to hold the role in the organisation\u2019s history.\\nShe said: \u201cLeading the TUC has been the greatest honour of my life. It has been a privilege to serve the trade union movement.\"\\nSir Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, has responded to the Met's \"partygate\" update.\\nHe said in a statement:\u00a0\u201cThese fines expose the shocking scale of the criminality in Boris Johnson\u2019s Number 10.\\n\u201cThe police have now completely shredded Johnson\u2019s claims that no laws were broken. He cannot be trusted and cannot continue as Prime Minister.\\n\u201cNo other leader in any other organisation would be allowed to continue after law-breaking on this scale. If Boris Johnson won\u2019t resign, Conservative MPs must show him the door.\u201d\\nThe all-party parliamentary group on Global LGBT+ Rights has now confirmed Crispin Blunt has resigned from his role as chairman.\\nMr Blunt said in a statement issued this morning (see the post below at 09.50) that he had offered to step down after he faced a backlash for his comments defending Imran Ahmad Khan.\\nThe group tweeted: \u201cHaving lost the confidence of the other officers, Crispin Blunt has now resigned as Chair of the APPG. Members were shocked by Crispin Blunt\u2019s recent comments - which he made in a personal capacity - about the conviction of his colleague Imran Ahmad Khan.\\n\u201cOur group will always stand up for victims of abuse. An Extraordinary General Meeting will be held in due course to elect a new chair.\u201d\\nHere is the statement in full from the Metropolitan Police:\\nThe investigation into allegations of breaches of COVID-19 regulations in Whitehall and Downing Street continues to progress.\u00a0  As of Tuesday, 12 April 2022 we have made over 50 referrals for fixed penalty notices (FPN) to the ACRO Criminal Records Office for breaches of Covid-19 regulations who following the referral issue the FPNs to the individual.\u00a0  We are making every effort to progress this investigation at speed, this includes continuing to assess significant amounts of investigative material from which further referrals may be made to ACRO [Criminal Records Office].\\nThe Metropolitan Police has announced it has now made more than 50 referrals for fines to be issued over the \"partygate\" scandal.\\nThe Met had previously announced it was issuing 20 fixed penalty notices as part of a first wave.\\nToday's announcement means at least another 30 fines are in the process of being issued.\\nMore reaction to the ONS numbers showing a fall in wages (see the post below at 11.15).\\nChristine Jardine, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 Treasury spokeswoman, said: \u201cToday\u2019s figures confirm the Conservative cost of living nightmare facing millions of UK families.\\n\u201cPeople are rightly angry with the Chancellor for refusing to throw them a lifeline when their incomes are being squeezed.\\n\u201cRishi Sunak should stop ignoring people's pain and slash VAT, putting an average of \u00a3600 into the pockets of every UK family.\u201d\\nWhile Rishi Sunak has welcomed the falling unemployment rate (see the post below at 11.03), today\u2019s numbers from the Office for National Statistics also contained some less positive news for the Government on wages.\\nThe figures showed UK workers have just suffered the biggest fall in their real pay in nearly nine years.\\nThe ONS said regular pay excluding bonuses fell by 1.8 per cent in the three months to February when taking soaring inflation into account -\u00a0 the steepest fall since August to October 2013.\\nLabour said the numbers \u201cshow that Conservative choices are leaving real wages squeezed and people worse off\u201d.\\nRishi Sunak said the numbers published by the Office for National Statistics (see the post below at 11.03) showed the \u201ccontinued strength of our jobs market, with the number of employees on payrolls rising once again in March and unemployment falling further below pre-pandemic levels\u201d.\\nMr Sunak added: \u201cWe are helping to cushion the impacts of global price rises through over \u00a322 billion of support for the cost of living this financial year.\\n\u201cWe\u2019re also helping people to find new jobs, and ensuring work always pays as this is the best way to support households in the longer term.\u201d\\nThe Office for National Statistics published new numbers this morning which showed the nation\u2019s unemployment rate has decreased.\\nIt fell by 0.2 per cent between December 2021 and February 2022 to 3.8 per cent for the quarter.\\nThat is the lowest number recorded since December 2019. It has not been lower than this since 1974.\\nMeanwhile, the latest estimate of payrolled employees for March this year showed a small monthly increase - up 35,000 to a record 29.6 million.\\nThe Liberal Democrats have announced they have reported Rishi Sunak to Kathryn Stone, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, as the party seeks an investigation into his financial declarations as an MP.\\nThe Lib Dems have accused the Chancellor of \u201cfailing to declare details of his multi-million pound investments prior to entering the Cabinet\u201d.\\nLord Geidt, the PM\u2019s Independent Adviser on Ministers\u2019 Interests, has already launched an investigation to examine Mr Sunak\u2019s declarations as a minister after the Chancellor himself asked for a probe.\\nBut the Lib Dems are now urging Ms Stone to examine his declaration of interests as an MP from 2015 to 2019 before he was elevated to the Cabinet.\\nDaisy Cooper, the deputy leader of the Lib Dems, said: \u201cThe British public deserve to know whether, when he was a backbench MP, Sunak\u2019s substantial investments influenced his actions in Parliament in any way. But, because he didn\u2019t declare his interests back then, we have no idea whether they did. That\u2019s why we need an urgent investigation into whether he broke the rules.\u201d\\nSir Keir Starmer has appeared to question the ability of very wealthy politicians to relate to the struggles of ordinary members of the public as he continued his attacks on Rishi Sunak.\\nAsked during an interview with The Guardian if he believed there are issues with such politicians becoming prime minister, Sir Keir reportedly replied: \"There's much more likely to be a conflict of interest. I don't know many people who have signed up to a non-dom scheme in order to increase their tax. It is pretty obvious why people do it.\"\\nHe also claimed the Chancellor's Spring Statement showed Mr Sunak\u00a0\"just doesn't get it\".\\nHis comments prompted a rebuke this morning from James Heappey, the minister for the armed forces, who told Sky News' Kay Burley\u00a0\"I\u00a0saw some sort of comment that suggested that because Rishi has been successful in his life before politics he is therefore out of touch.\\n\u201cI think that also is ridiculous. You yourself Kay, have on occasions challenged MPs and ministers about their competence and whether or not they are up to the job.\\n\"Well, here we have got someone who has demonstrably been hugely successful in a career in finance before entering Parliament is now responsible for running our economy and very obviously I want people to be running the economy who have been very successful in the financial industry before coming\u00a0 into politics because surely they are the best qualified with all the necessary experience and expertise.\"\\nJames Heappey, the minister for the armed forces, has given his backing to Rishi Sunak as the row over the Chancellor's finances\u00a0rumbles on.\\nAsked if he is supportive of Mr Sunak, Mr Heappey told Sky News: \"Yes, I am. I think that he has been clear about what the arrangements are. He has recognised that even after his reassurances people still wanted some further reassurance so he has referred himself to Lord Geidt.\\n\u201cBut I think Rishi is pretty straight forward, pretty straight talking and he has been pretty clear on what the circumstances are.\u201d\\nMembers of the\u00a0all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on Global LGBT+ Rights had last night said they were quitting the body as Crispin Blunt, its chairman,\u00a0faced a backlash over his\u00a0comments about the conviction of Imran Ahmad Khan.\\nA number of MPs in the group urged Mr Blunt to resign from his position. He\u00a0has now said he has offered his resignation as chairman.\\nHe said: \"It is a particularly difficult time for LGBT+ rights across the world and my statement risks distracting the APPG for Global LGBT+ Rights from its important purpose.\\n\"I have today offered the officers my resignation so a new chair can be found to continue the work of the group with full force.\"\\nJoe Biden, the US President, has made clear the use of chemical weapons by Russia\u00a0in Ukraine would cross a red line and the West would respond.\\nJames Heappey, the minister for the armed forces, told Sky News that if the use of the weapons is confirmed then \"all possible options are on the table\" for the response.\\nHe told Sky News: \"These are appalling weapons to think about using. The fact that they are part of the discussion is deeply sobering.\\n\"It is not just the President of the United States, the President of France and our own Prime Minister have also been clear that there are weapons that simply should not be used. If they are used people will be held to account.\\n\"I think it is useful to maintain some ambiguity over exactly what the response would be but let's be clear, if they are used at all then President Putin should know that all possible options are on the table in terms of how the West might respond.\"\\nBritain is currently working with its international partners to verify the details of reports that Russian forces may have used chemical agents in an attack on Mariupol.\\nJames Heappey, the minister for the armed forces, said the UK had not yet been able to confirm the reports.\\nHe told Sky News: \"We know that there are reports of the use of chemical weapons.\u00a0We have not been able to verify those ourselves and indeed the Ukrainian system as you have seen from President Zelensky are only referring to the fact that there are reports.\\n\"They themselves haven\u2019t yet\u00a0been able to confirm to us that they have been used.\u201d\\nImran Ahmad Khan\u2019s legal team has said he will be appealing against his conviction. He has not yet been sentenced.\\nIf Khan, the MP for Wakefield, chooses not to resign, a by-election could be forced using Parliament\u2019s recall petition process.\\nMPs can be recalled if they are convicted \u201cin the UK of any offence and sentenced or ordered to be imprisoned or detained, after all appeals have been exhausted\u201d, according to a House of Commons library briefing paper.\\nA sentence of more than 12 months in jail automatically disqualifies someone from being an MP. If the conditions for a recall petition are met, the Commons Speaker then notifies the relevant constituency\u2019s returning officer.\\nThe petition would then be launched and would remain open for people to sign for six weeks. If 10 per cent or more of the constituency\u2019s eligible registered voters sign the petition then it is deemed a success and the seat is declared vacant. A by-election is then required.\\nJames Heappey, the minister for the armed forces, was asked if he believes Imran Ahmad Khan should resign as an MP following his conviction yesterday.\\nMr Heappey told Sky News there are \"mechanisms\" to force a by-election if Khan chooses not to quit.\\nHe said: \"The way that Parliament works is that you are elected as an individual so his seat in the House of Commons is his until he personally chooses to vacate it.\\n\u201cThere are mechanisms now through recall petitions that have been in place since I think 2015 from memory so if he chooses not to there are now mechanisms through which he can be removed from his seat and subjected to a by-election.\\n\"I understand he has plans to appeal but quite frankly everybody in Government respects that a court of law has found him guilty and that must be the judgement until he appeals successfully.\u201d\\nCrispin Blunt has now deleted the statement on his website in which he defended Imran Ahmad Khan.\\nThe statement, published yesterday, had started: \u201cI am utterly appalled and distraught at the dreadful miscarriage of justice that has befallen my friend and colleague Imran Ahmad Khan, MP for Wakefield since December 2019. His conviction today is nothing short of an international scandal, with dreadful wider implications for millions of LGBT+ muslims around the world.\u201d\\nWhile the original statement has been deleted, Mr Blunt is yet to issue a follow up statement or comment publicly to retract his comments or apologise.\\nCrispin Blunt is under mounting pressure to withdraw the claims he made about the conviction of Imran Ahmad Khan.\\nA Tory source said: \u201cCrispin\u2019s views are wholly unacceptable.\\n\u201cFollowing exchanges late last night we expect the statement to be retracted first thing this morning.\u201d\\nCrispin Blunt last night sparked a furious backlash after he claimed\u00a0the conviction of Tory MP Imran Ahmad Khan for sexually assaulting a teenage boy\u00a0was \"nothing short of an international scandal\". (You can read the original story here).\\nJames Heappey, the minister for the armed forces, was asked this morning during an interview on Sky News if the Government distances itself from the comments and he replied: \"Yes.\"\\nAsked if he expected Mr Blunt to retract the comments, Mr Heappey said: \"I don\u2019t know because I have no idea what it is that Crispin is referring to in the comments that he has said.\\n\u201cAll I know is that in a court of law yesterday Mr Khan was found guilty and I think everyone of us who believes in the judicial system and the rule of law has to respect that judgement.\\n\u201cI think it is for Crispin to account for his words but it is not something the Government associates itself with.\u201d\\nGood morning and welcome to today's politics live blog.\\nJames Heappey, the minister for the armed forces, is on the broadcast round for the Government.\\nI'll take you through the key lines.", "image": [["Rishi Sunak has signalled he will stay on as Chancellor after he was fined over 'partygate'", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2022/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000292616542_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=680"]], "author": ["Jack Maidment", "Dominic Penna"], "date": "2022-04-12"}, "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2022/04/23/white-wealthy-wasteful-does-golf-have-future/": {"title": "White, wealthy and wasteful: does golf have a future?", "subtitle": "It's under fire from those who believe it\u2019s the best way to ruin a nice walk \u2013 but supporters say the game is far from up", "text": "The road to Hertfordshire is paved with golf intentions. Most routes out of Greater London are, but particularly to the north and the south, you could climb a tree, squint, and spot no fewer than a dozen golfing facilities, each seemingly identical to the others, all within a few miles.\\nSt Albans Road is one such artery. Technically the A1081, it runs from the borough of Barnet out of the capital, over the county line, and off into suburbia. As you stand on that line, where city melds with country, you\u2019d be a short drive from four golf courses to the south, three to the east, four to the west and one literally either side of you. What is it they say about rats, again?\\n\u2018Yeah, we\u2019ve got quite a few around here, but they\u2019re not all like this,\u2019 one local golfer, Cos, tells me with admirable restraint, after he\u2019s completed a round at the course on my left. A course called The Shire, which was opened a full 97 years after Old Fold Manor, directly opposite.\\nThe positioning was partly deliberate. The Shire is run by the Menai-Davis family: Tony, Anne and their sons Ceri and Cae. In 1990, Tony, a local who had worked in the rag trade, wanted to join a golf club. So he applied to Old Fold Manor, and was promptly turned away.\\n\u2018Face didn\u2019t fit. No real reasons were given, but elitist is what it was \u2013 he just hadn\u2019t come from the kind of work where you played golf. He\u2019d played football but got a bit old, and wanted to carry on with a sport,\u2019 Cae, 35, says. \u2018So he went home that night and without any experience whatsoever, started a plan to create his own golf course.\u2019\\nIt took him a while, 17 years in all, but the land became available for purchase, and the gift of the gab helped. Tony, who is now 64, managed to find the contact number of legendary Spanish former world number one Seve Ballesteros, and pitched him the idea of designing his first UK course. Ballesteros was up for it, so they went into partnership, eventually opening The Shire in 2007.\\n\u2018Seve [who died in 2011] was adored mainly because he was working class,\u2019 says Cae Menai-Davis. \u2018What does that say about golf, that someone can be adored, be seen as different, just because they\u2019re not from money? There\u2019s so much money in the game, but it doesn\u2019t filter down.\u2019\\nThe Shire remains the only Ballesteros-designed course in the country, and since then, the Menai-Davis family have been on a mission to alter the general reputation of golf as elite, white, wealthy, greedy and \u2013 to some \u2013 utterly pointless.\\nMenai-Davis gestures to some members, a diverse group of varying ages and ethnicities, just heading in for a post-round pint. \u2018How a sport becomes seen as elitist is how it\u2019s marketed, how it\u2019s advertised, and over the last century, golf has become that,\u2019 he says. Menai-Davis also runs a charity, The Golf Trust, which aims to make the sport more inclusive.\\n\u2018If you\u2019re only shown one picture, then seeing golf as elitist is understandable. For us, though, sport is equal. You shouldn\u2019t need to be given permission to walk on to a golf course.\u2019\\nThe problem, which he realises, is that golf doesn\u2019t tend to help itself. At a professional level, it still relies so heavily on the star power of Tiger Woods that if he\u2019s absent from a major tournament for any reason (and there has often been a major reason), interest from neutrals vanishes.\\nYoung players and personalities are emerging, but the recent 2022 Masters, won by 25-year-old Scottie Scheffler as he fended off Rory McIlroy\u2019s late charge, was a case in point: Woods, despite not having played seriously in 500 days and with one good leg, was a late entrant, and as a consequence ESPN reported a \u2018Tiger Bounce\u2019 of around 30 per cent more viewers than in 2021.\\nAt an amateur level, the stolid gatekeepers of what the sport \u2018should\u2019 look like \u2013 who should be playing it, how they should dress, where courses should be, how they should be kept, and what role they play in the environment \u2013 can make the Mennonites look at the vanguard of modern values.\\nThose attitudes are changing, but at the pace of a particularly relaxed pallbearer. It means that despite an increase in interest during the pandemic (4.8 million adults played on a full-length course in Britain in 2021, down on the 5.2 million in 2020 but almost double the figure from 2017, when the trend was looking alarming for the industry), if golf is to find a new audience, it needs to iron out its issues. Or to put it in a language golfers understand: it\u2019s shooting at one over, when a birdie is needed.\\n\u2018Golf,\u2019 Menai-Davis says, over a coffee in The Shire\u2019s clubhouse, \u2018is the only sport where three, four generations of the same family can play together, regardless of gender, ability, fitness, age.\u2019 It\u2019s a common refrain from defenders. \u2018It\u2019s the most inclusive game in the world, made exclusive by perception.\u2019 He frowns, his eyes drifting out towards his immaculate greens. \u2018Very rarely do we see a positive news story about golf.\u2019\\nTo the casual observer, the most obvious thing about golf is that it gets everywhere. According to some estimates, Britain\u2019s more than 2,500 golf courses cover 1,256 sq km (485 square miles) \u2013 roughly the same size as Greater Manchester and, it has been claimed, using some controversial arithmetic, a figure only slightly smaller than the land covered by housing.\\nHertfordshire has a high concentration of courses, but there are heavily golfed areas all over the country. St Andrews, the home of the sport, has two dozen courses within 25 miles. The town of Woking in Surrey, which is itself a county with around 150 courses, is more than 10 per cent golf. But those are vaguely in the countryside. London, which resolutely isn\u2019t, has 95 courses. To many people, including architect Russell Curtis, that\u2019s a problem.\\nLast year, Curtis, a self-professed housing nerd and a \u2018rubbish\u2019 golfer, created The Golf Belt, an analysis of the space taken up by golf in the capital, having noticed in lockdown that much of the land around his home in Barnet \u2013 site of The Shire and its many, many rivals \u2013 is restricted due to golf.\\nUsing mapping tools, he put together a study that makes for uneasy reading for London\u2019s golfers. Curtis reasoned that the average hole on a golf course occupies around 2.5 hectares, which is space that could fit 100 homes \u2013 in a city enduring a perpetual housing crisis. In all, he found, building on the city\u2019s golf courses could house 345,257 people at a density of 60 dwellings per hectare.\\n\u2018The courses just don\u2019t seem like a very good use of land in a congested city like London; they don\u2019t really feel like they serve the city,\u2019 he says. \u2018Access to green spaces and leisure areas is important, but given the limited access most people have to them \u2013 you can\u2019t wander across most of them \u2013 it just doesn\u2019t seem very fair, when so many people can\u2019t access green space. The area taken up by London\u2019s courses is the same size as Brent, a mid-size borough. An entire borough taken up by\u2026 golf.\u2019\\nIt wouldn\u2019t even take much, the report argued. Public golf courses in London provide 720 holes, it found; reduce that by 224 and just shy of 80 per cent of Londoners living in temporary accommodation could be housed. It makes you wonder whether any golfer would even notice.\\n\u2018And a lot of these courses are just too big: people don\u2019t have the time to play for four or five hours on 18-hole courses. I\u2019ve spoken to golf architects about this, who say that quite a lot of the larger ones could be dramatically reduced in size and still be 18 holes. These things are ginormous.\u2019\\nReducing the size of courses is an argument even those at the top end of the sport are proposing. New courses are getting bigger and bigger, which has led to the rise of \u2018big hitters\u2019 like the American Bryson DeChambeau, a Trump-loving professional whose monster, 340-yard drives have seen him labelled \u2018boring\u2019 and accused of ruining the skill involved in the sport. As a result, there are calls for courses to be smaller but harder.\\nCurtis isn\u2019t against golf per se, nor is he against courses on greenbelt land, like The Shire, that might not be used for anything else. Instead \u2018my piece was deliberately provocative, I\u2019m not serious about it, I\u2019m just questioning it,\u2019 he says. \u2018I\u2019m trying to promote a reassessment of those courses.\u2019\\nThe basic point is that golf courses, which are so often exclusive by design, need to prove their worth to the local community if they are to slowly surround residential areas. One estimate by the American writer Malcolm Gladwell held that if every player on a basketball court had the same space a golfer receives, the hoops would be 400 metres apart.\\nAt The Shire, Menai-Davis proudly mentions the permissive path around the course, which the public are free to use. In lockdown, the family allowed anybody on to the course, as long as they were respectful, to use it as green space and feed the swans. As at many courses around the country, they were ushered back to the perimeter when the club reopened.\\nLocals haven\u2019t pushed back in Hertfordshire, but in other areas of the country \u2013 such as Brighton, a city wreathed in golf courses \u2013 campaigners supported by Extinction Rebellion have led calls for golfing land to be rewilded. One course overlooking the Channel, Waterhall, has been closed down in recent years to provide 220 acres of rewilded space; but another under threat, Hollingbury, remains open.\\n\u2018CAUTION \u2013 You are entering a golf course. Please proceed with care,\u2019 read warnings, shrouded in the gorse and hawthorns, at Hollingbury today. Locals have complained that despite the understanding that golfers and walkers can share the space, tensions are fraught. Golfers complain that people sunbathe on the greens, build sandcastles in the bunkers, and let their dogs foul the fairways. Walkers complain that they have to be near golfers. They both make compelling points.\\nIf they\u2019re not willing to give up space, many golf courses could do more for the sport\u2019s image if they listened to environmental concerns. Water use (in the US alone, it has been estimated that 9.4 billion litres of water are used on golf courses for irrigation daily, which is almost the same as all private lawns and gardens), pesticide and herbicide-spraying, imported vegetation and unfriendliness to wildlife are all common issues.\\nThere are numerous examples of courses doing excellent things to the contrary, from wildflower meadows to butterfly and bird breeding programmes, and some carefully managed clubs, especially coastal links courses like Newquay or Nairn, are better for the environment than if they weren\u2019t there.\\nBut again, it\u2019s about perception, and the sight of unnaturally green and pleasant courses on television with grass closer to baize than anything recognisably natural, gives many the impression that the exceptions are just that.\\nAt Augusta National, in Georgia, home of the Masters and perhaps the world\u2019s most exclusive golf club, the greens sit above a \u2018SubAir System\u2019 of pipes and blowers, which regulate the firmness of the ground.\\n\u2018They don\u2019t cut the greens here at Augusta, they use bikini wax,\u2019 one legendary US golf commentator once said on air. He was removed from the broadcast, but he might have been right: some clubs will do anything to give members the perfect surface, and the golfers may or may not be aware of (or care) how it was made. Royal Holloway, University of London, once surveyed people about whether golf was good for the environment. Among golfers, 80 per cent said it was good; among non-golfers, the figure was only 36 per cent.\\nIn a way, Menai-Davis is right: you never read positive news about golf. Instead, you see stories about clubs banning hoodies, or jeans, or women; you read how 73 per cent of clubs charge a standard playing membership cost of over \u00a31,000, a figure that will only rise; or you see photographs of golfers idly playing in Oregon while a wildfire rages behind them; or you read about how Donald Trump has issued a statement to let people know he has hit a hole-in-one; or how Gareth Bale keeps launching terrible-sounding golf-themed bars; or how it\u2019s Prince Andrew\u2019s favourite sport.\\n\u2018What you don\u2019t hear is about how much golf can benefit people in inner-city communities, or people with disabilities, or people who struggle with social isolation or low energy, and golf\u2019s uniqueness in allowing people to gently see their development, without overexerting themselves, and get in the fresh air,\u2019 Menai-Davis says.\\n\u2018We\u2019re told golf is this, golf is that, but we send second-hand clubs to poor communities all around the world, we have events for disabled children and their carers, and we\u2019ve got every race, religion, profession in that bar next door. It can be the most diverse, constructive game available \u2013 if you do it right.\u2019\\nThe Shire might be doing things right (it is worth pointing out that despite the laudable charity work and lack of stuffiness, an adult membership at the club, which gets you golf plus various benefits, is still \u00a31,900 per year, according to Menai-Davis), but others aren\u2019t, and they\u2019re still making money.\\n\u2018It\u2019s true \u2013 if they\u2019re a successful business, they\u2019ll be reluctant to change. However, the average age of the members at some of these old-fashioned golf courses is so old, they\u2019ll need to regenerate to get a new crop,\u2019 Menai-Davis says. Unsurprisingly, his family have seen the business grow, and now have several courses opening in London.\\n\u2018You need a willingness to change, and some just won\u2019t. That new generation has different values, so if you want new, young, different people to get into golf, you need to be welcoming, environmentally friendly; you need to think of the local community, have a soft play, represent where you\u2019re from, and be a benefit to them. It\u2019s not hard.\u2019\\nWe are being eavesdropped on. Cos and his friend, Sam, have been listening in, nodding occasionally, giving \u2018eh, not sure about that\u2026\u2019 looks every once in a while, and enjoying their green tea.\\n\u2018We could go to any course around here, they aren\u2019t all that different, it\u2019s just how they\u2019re run. There\u2019s one up the road where it\u2019s a rich area, the manager\u2019s a prick, the club is old school, it\u2019s not welcoming, I\u2019d never take my kids there,\u2019 Sam says.\\nCos nods. \u2018If your phone rings here, you can answer it.\u2019 This doesn\u2019t seem like groundbreaking generosity, but apparently it is. \u2018If it rang in the other one, you\u2019d get a big telling off.\u2019\\nSam fiddles with a Lotus biscuit, then pockets it for later. You\u2019ve got to get your \u00a31,900\u2019s worth somehow.\\n\u2018People need to respect the place, we don\u2019t just want anyone wandering in, but it\u2019s not ridiculous here. Some places just won\u2019t move with the times.\u2019\\nWhether it intends to or not, golf has a diversity issue, as well. It may be a sport that can be played by anybody, but it doesn\u2019t tend to represent everybody. One of golf\u2019s many perversities is that Tiger Woods, its greatest ever player, has described himself as \u2018Cablinasian\u2019 (Caucasian, Black, American Indian and Asian), but 25 years after his first major win, many people from ethnic minorities still feel uncomfortable at courses.\\nOne survey of BAME citizens in 2020 found that 92.4 per cent felt golf was either not inclusive at all or observed that \u2018some people like me are welcome but it is rare\u2019, despite 25 per cent stating they\u2019d be \u2018very interested\u2019 in trying it.\\nBoth Sam and Cos are Greek Cypriot, and \u2013 not being white British \u2013 used to be in a minority at other clubs. \u2018This one\u2019s easily the most cosmopolitan place we\u2019ve been. You get every nationality, Indians, Greek, Chinese, you could be anything. And I won\u2019t name drop but you get some famous people, too.\u2019\\n(Forty-five seconds later, he tells me these are former footballers Jermaine Jenas, Andy Cole and Rio Ferdinand, plus DJ Trevor Nelson. Not quite a galaxy of stars, but at least they\u2019re not pale, stale, or a senior royal desperately avoiding jail.)\\nMenai-Davis, like his dad, is an optimist, on and off the fairway. Golf has given his family their livelihood, but the fact its fiercest critics consider it not just a good walk spoiled but morally unjustifiable, means it might need to take a short look at itself before the next round.\\n\u2018In 20 years or so, I think we\u2019ll see fewer golf courses, but better golf courses,\u2019 he says. \u2018The ones with an older demographic, who don\u2019t consider their impact, won\u2019t survive. The ones who do will need to reflect the times.\u2019\\nOn St Albans Road, The Shire\u2019s land starts right where countryside begins \u2013 I can see a horse, anyway. \u2018Hertfordshire: The county of opportunity\u2019 reads the last sign before you set foot deep in golf country.\\nAn opportunity is what golf has arrived at.

Then, at least, we could laugh at the likes of Robin Boardman-Pattison, a Bristol graduate and product of a \u00a317,500 a year private education who had turned to climate activism \u2013 between posting Instagram shots of his numerous foreign holidays.\\nThe group\u2019s antics seem rather less amusing now to the millions of people who have woken up to find their domestic energy bills increased by half and whose cars have been forced off the road by soaring petrol prices. I predict that today\u2019s protests, trying to block oil refineries under the banner Just Stop Oil, will go down even less well. Compounding drivers' miseries still further, the group has also announced a new wave of daily mass protests in UK cities starting next week.\\nThe energy crisis has exposed XR for what they really are: a bunch of relatively, well-off middle class people who barely seem to need to work, let alone worry about the cost of living, and whose absolutist environmental policies are an indulgence which few ordinary people can afford. Worse, they have become Putin\u2019s useful idiots.\\nIn the na\u00efve world of XR and their cheerleaders, soaring gas and oil prices demonstrate why we need to transition, almost immediately, to renewable energy. Yet this calculation ignores that way that rampant inflation is working its way into the green economy as well. The steel needed to construct wind turbines, the rare metals needed for electric cars and other batteries, the price of wood for biomass power stations, labour costs for insulating homes, installing heat pumps and so on; all have increased sharply in price too. Follow XR's advice and finish off the fossil fuel industry now, and the inflation we have seen so far would seem a relatively minor hit to household finances.\\nIf green energy really were so much cheaper than fossil fuels it wouldn\u2019t need government intervention to sell it. The reason why wind and solar accounts for a minimal proportion of Britain\u2019s total energy consumption is due to cost and the immense practical problems involved. Turn off the gas supply and we would have no way of making up for when wind and solar farms are producing little energy. We could try hurriedly to build battery storage, but not at affordable cost \u2013 storing energy in lithium batteries currently costs around five times what it costs to generate the electricity in the first place.\\nWe would be in a much better position now, however, had greens not helped destroy UK fracking. The argument parroted by the anti-fracking lobby \u2013 that extra, UK-produced gas wouldn\u2019t reduce prices for consumers because the gas would be sold on international markets \u2013 is fallacious. It costs a lot of money to transport gas, either by pipeline or by ship. In the latter case \u2013 which accounts for an increasing slice of gas imports \u2013 gas must be liquified, transported several weeks in refrigerated ships and then regasified: costs which could be avoided if the gas were produced locally.\\nVladimir Putin must love XR. It is partly thanks to environmental groups that we have remained dependent on Russian gas and that he can \u2013 as he did yesterday \u2013 threaten to cut off Europe\u2019s gas supply unless we pay him in roubles. Pointedly, some of the anti-fracking propaganda of recent years has been identified as coming from Russia itself: the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence concluded in 2017 that the now defunct Kremlin-funded TV station Russia Today \u201cruns anti-fracking programming, highlighting environmental issues and the impacts on public health\u201d.\\nIn 2013 Putin himself weighed in to the fracking debate, stating falsely that people living in areas where fracking is carried out: \"no longer have water coming out of their taps but a blackish slime\u201d.\\nIf you are sitting in the road outside an oil refinery this morning you are not just pushing for policies which would push up bills for ordinary households even further: you are doing Putin\u2019s dirty work for him.", "image": null, "author": null, "date": "2022-04-01"}}
