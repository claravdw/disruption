Priti Patel, the Home Secretary,\u00a0said she was \"disgusted\".\\nBaron Walney has launched a call for evidence to give the public a say on how political protests are handled. He said he wanted to know whether people are \"comfortable\" with the disruption caused by groups such as XR blocking roads, stopping public transport and halting newspapers.\\n\"I want to draw out, debate and expose what I think can be an extraordinary doublethink,\" he said. \"Because these are environmental protesters and because on, let's say, the liberal centre and left, there can be pretty strong views about Rupert Murdoch.\\n\"That doesn't get anything like the attention than if you imagine if a right-wing group stopped The Guardian and Mirror from printing. There would be absolute bedlam if that happened.\"\\nBaron Walney said there was a focus on the proposed Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill's proposal to curb noise, a controversial measure that would \"understandably\" be intensely debated in Parliament.\\nBut he added: \"If you flip the idea and, say, that was a group like the English Defence League that was camped as a huge mob outside Parliament trying to disrupt the process of, for example, a future Government passing more liberal immigration laws, and that group was doing a large spectrum of measures to try to influence and intimidate parliament including making so much noise that the democratic debate within Parliament was being affected.\\n\"I think the same people who would say this is a preposterous and terrible attack on our basic liberty to scream in the face of elected politicians would take a rather different view if the cause was different.\"\\nHe added that he could not explain why there should be less of an outcry against a liberal cause, claiming we are often \"swayed by our own biases\".\\nBaron Walney said he wanted to know whether the political classes, who like him might have been imbued with a belief in the right to protest \u2013 he was taken on CND marches at the age of four \u2013 were out of touch with the public who might take a more sceptical view about the disruption caused.\\nHe suggested there might even be a case to consider whether the Government's Criminal Justice Bill had not gone far enough on protest, as police officers he had spoken to had wanted\u00a0\u2013 but not got \u2013 powers to stop demonstrators going to protests with locking devices or glue to maximise disruption.\\nBristol has seen three violent protests in one week against the proposed Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which would give police in England and Wales more power to impose conditions on non-violent protests including those deemed too noisy or a nuisance, with those convicted liable to fines or jail terms.\\nA demonstration last Sunday, which began peacefully, descended into a riot when some 500 people marched on Bridewell police station. Twelve people were arrested and there were a further 10 arrests on Friday, including three linked to Sunday's violence.\\nOn Saturday night, David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, criticised the \"heavy-handed\" police response to the protest but also said protesters had been \"piling into Bristol\" and \"stoking\" tension. Mr Lammy, who is opposed to the Police and Crime Bill, told LBC the image of police breaking up demonstrators on Friday \"looks severe, really, really heavy handed\".\\nMarvin Rees, the Bristol Mayor, said it was concerning how many people were travelling to the city to protest or \"cause conflict\".\\nA senior police chief said large gatherings are still illegal under coronavirus regulations and warned of groups wanting to \"hijack\" legitimate protests.\\nAhead of Friday's protest, Martin Hewitt, the chairman of the National Police Chiefs Council, said: \"I would ask people planning to protest this weekend to think carefully and consider whether joining a large gathering outside in the midst of a pandemic, and potentially being near the scene of violence like we saw last weekend, is something that is safe for them as individuals to do.\\n\"And let me really be clear that any person who is identified committing such acts of violence as we saw can expect to face the full weight of the law.\"\\nOn Saturday, thousands of anti-lockdown protesters clashed with police in Bradford.

This week has seen the spectre of the nuclear explosion rattle its chains again \u2013 with the revelation that France under-reported the levels of radiation emitted by its atomic test programme in the South Pacific in the mid- and late-20th century. The findings, unearthed by the French investigative website Disclose, with the assistance of American and British researchers, throws open a door for thousands of residents of French Polynesia to pursue compensation for the health consequences of the bomb blasts \u2013 which occurred between 1966 and as recently as 1996.\\nThe news is hardly surprising. Governments have rarely been open about the effects of unleashing clouds of toxic matter into the atmosphere \u2013\u00a0and while it is French secrecy which stands in the dock this month, Paris has not been alone in smearing radiation across the planet. France is, of course, one of the five official \u201cnuclear weapon states\u201d (NWS), along with the USA, the UK, Russia and China, while three other nations \u2013\u00a0India, Pakistan and North Korea \u2013\u00a0have openly conducted tests. Add in presumptions about the nuclear status of Israel and Iran, and the atomic map extends to four continents.\\nIts shadow stretches much further \u2013\u00a0into arid landscapes, areas of placid beauty, and remote islands supposedly removed from trouble\u2019s path. In the 76 years since the first nuclear device was detonated \u2013\u00a0in the Jornada del Muerto desert of New Mexico in July 1945, as part of the Manhattan Project \u2013\u00a0locations from the waters of tropical oceans to the sands of the Sahara have witnessed the grim ascent of a mushroom cloud. Most are still scarred by the experience, but some have become places of fascination (dark tourism, if you will), while others are inching towards a brighter existence in a century which \u2013\u00a0you might hope \u2013\u00a0is less keen to flirt with global armageddon at the push of a few buttons.\\nFrance conducted some 180 nuclear tests in the Pacific region in the course of 30 years. The majority took place at Moruroa Atoll \u2013 although others occurred at the neighbouring Fangataufa Atoll, 23 miles south, on the east flank of the broader Tuamoto Archipelago.\\nMoruroa does not differ in geography from the rest of French Polynesia \u2013 spreading out for 17 miles as a ring of low-slung coral islets encircling a lagoon. It was this sheltered lake which bore the brunt of the experiments, firstly on July 2 1966, with the detonation of a plutonium fission bomb that \u2013 according to a later study by Greenpeace \u2013 sucked out all the water from the lagoon, before \u201craining dead fish and molluscs down on the atoll\u201d.\\nThese activities usually took place amid strict secrecy \u2013 but they were not without interested observers. Remarkably, French president Charles de Gaulle was present at Moruroa on September 10 1966, when a nuclear device was set off as it hung from a balloon. Protests by New Zealand \u2013 which sent two frigates to the atoll in 1973 \u2013 saw the experiments driven underground, into tunnels drilled into the volcanic rock. But this did not stem the controversy. A system failure in July 1979, which saw a device become wedged only halfway down its shaft at a depth of just 400m, sparked land slippage and a tsunami. Anger only intensified when France conducted a further series of tests in 1995 and 1996, mere months before the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. The radioactive fallout of the process is estimated to have affected 110,000 French Polynesians \u2013 this week\u2019s report pays special attention to the test which took place at Moruroa on July 17 1974, where the subsequent atomic cloud took an unexpected trajectory \u2013 drifting across Tahiti and its capital Papeete.\\nThe situation raised further bleak headlines in the summer of 1985. Frustrated at Greenpeace\u2019s ongoing opposition to the tests, agents for the DGSE (Direction Generale de la Securite Exterieure; the French foreign intelligence service) planted two bombs on the hull of the environmental group\u2019s ship the Rainbow Warrior on the night of July 10, as it was docked in Auckland. The explosions killed the Portuguese-Dutch photographer Fernando Pereira, sank the vessel \u2013 and triggered a wave of international condemnation.\\nYou have to travel a long way into Africa\u2019s biggest country to find the location of France\u2019s first nuclear explosion. Reggane is the last town you reach if you head south on the Tanezrouft Track \u2013 the lower half of Algeria\u2019s N6 highway, which cuts across the Sahara to Mali. It is a remote dot on the map, marooned some 900 miles from the capital Algiers. It is a small place as well, with a population of 20,000 largely Berber inhabitants, scratching out a living close to the southernmost oasis of the Tuat region. Beyond it lies the dunes of the planet\u2019s greatest desert, sand swallowing sand all the way to the horizon.\\nIt was for this reason that France decided it could conduct nuclear experiments here \u2013 in an unseen shard of what was then its colony. The timing was contentious. When that first mushroom cloud billowed, on February 13 1960, France was already embroiled in the eight-year war (1954-1962) that would see Algeria wrench itself out of foreign control. Gerboise Bleue (Blue Jerboa \u2013 named after the Saharan rodent) went ahead even as bullets were flying elsewhere; a plutonium-filled bomb detonated at the top of a 100m steel tower. Three further explosions would take place at the site over the next 15 months (Gerboise Blanche, Gerboise Rouge, Gerboise Verte), but the first was by far the biggest. Indeed, at that point, it was the biggest test blast that had ever been unleashed. Fat Man, the bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki in August 1945, was \u201conly\u201d a third as powerful.\\nThe French media reacted exultantly. Africa recoiled \u2013 Morocco withdrew its ambassador from Paris; Ghana froze all French assets within its borders. But the experiments continued \u2013 even after Algeria had won its independence. Eighteen tests were conducted at a new underground facility near In Ekker \u2013 an even more remote village, in the Hoggar Mountains \u2013 between November 1961 and February 1966. These were not without issues. On May 1 1962, the \u201cBeryl Incident\u201d saw a cloud of dust escape the improperly sealed shaft that had been built to contain it, exposing more than 100 people to radiation \u2013 including France\u2019s Minister of Scientific Research, Gaston Palewski, who would die of leukaemia 22 years later. In 1999, a survey of the site by the International Atomic Energy Agency found that it was still contaminated, and a threat to the local nomadic population.\\nBritain ran ahead of France in the race to be a nuclear power. Having been rebuffed by the USA in a request to share the full results of the Manhattan Project, London embarked on its own bomb-building programme. The first bitter fruit of it was Operation Hurricane \u2013 the detonation of a plutonium implosion device in the Montebello Islands of Western Australia, just before 8am on October 3 1952.\\nThe explosion caused one notable \u201cfatality\u201d. HMS Plym was a veteran of the Second World War \u2013 a River-class frigate, launched in 1943, which had served in the anti-submarine convoy in the Atlantic. It was within its hull that a 25-ton atom bomb was set off, as it was anchored off Trimouille Island (to simulate the consequences of a similar device being smuggled into British port).Derek Hickman, an engineer observing the blast from a distance, remarked that all that remained of the Plym \u201cwere a few fist-sized pieces of metal that fell like rain, and the shape of the frigate scorched on the sea bed.\u201d A blackened paste washed up on the shore.\\nThe fallout cloud spluttered upwards to an altitude of 10,000ft (3,048m). But although it drifted out to sea, as had been the intention, it would reverse its direction and blow across the Australian mainland. Radiation would be detected as far away as Brisbane, on the Queensland shore. Nonetheless, two further blasts were staged in the islands \u2013 on Trimouille and the neighbouring Alpha outcrop \u2013 in the May and June of 1956 (as part of \u201cOperation Mosaic\u201d), before Britain\u2019s nuclear test programme was transferred elsewhere.\\nThe Montebello Islands were chosen for their location \u2013 they lie 80 miles off the Pilbara coast of north-western Australia. But they suffered for their isolation. Radiation was still apparent in the early 1980s, and access to Trimouille was prohibited until 1992. Australia had agreed to the area being a nuclear test site in 1951, but has taken a different approach in the new millennium \u2013 the archipelago is now a conservation park. Wildlife has been reintroduced \u2013 with birds like sooty oystercatchers, and marsupials such as the wallaby, transferred in from nearby Barrow Island. An obelisk marks the site of the explosion on Alpha, but visitors are advised not to linger long \u2013 or collect souvenirs \u2013 on either island.\\nBritain\u2019s nuclear ambitions would also impose themselves on the Australian mainland. In October 1953, Operation Totem saw a pair of tests conducted at Emu Field, in the South Australian desert. This was a far less remote location than the Montebello Islands, \u201cjust\u201d 700 miles from the state capital Adelaide, and the radioactive cloud from the first test \u2013 Totem 1 \u2013 would drag its tendrils north-east across the landmass.\\nThe site is now regarded as safe to visit (though permission is needed; it forms part of the RAAF Woomera Range complex) \u2013 and provides proof of the ferocity of the blasts in vitrified sand and scorch rings. The epicentre of Totem 1 is marked with an obelisk which declares that \u201cradiation levels for a few hundred metres around this point may be above those considered safe for permanent occupation\u201d. It can be part of a particularly hardy journey into the Australian Outback along the Anne Beadell Highway \u2013 the 823-mile unsealed road between Coober Pedy (in South Australia) and Laverton in Western Australia, which passes Emu Field \u2013 and was partly constructed (between 1953 and 1962) to facilitate the nuclear experiments.\\nSouth Australia\u2019s recollections of the second test site on its soil are much angrier. Though marginally closer to Adelaide (it sits some 140 miles south of Emu Field, about 500 miles north-west of the city) Maralinga is harder to reach. This partly explains why its desert landscape fell prey to seven weighty British nuclear tests between 1956 and 1963, mainly as part of Operation Buffalo (1956) and Operation Antler (1957). The area was left badly contaminated \u2013 and \u201cclean-ups\u201d in 1963, 1964 and 1967 undid only a little of the damage.\\nWhile, as with the Montebello Islands, the Australian government had given its consent for the tests, attitudes have \u2013 understandably \u2013 hardened significantly over time. A fuller rehabilitation of the area was attempted between 1996 and 2000, with the British government contributing an initial \u00a320million of funding in 1993. But the test site and its legacy remain enormously controversial \u2013 even though the land was formally handed back to its indigenous guardians, the Maralinga Tjarutja, between 2009 and 2014. The radioactive stain has also seeped into the country\u2019s culture as well as its ground. The Sydney band Midnight Oil are among the various Australian musicians to have addressed the topic \u2013 notably on the track Maralinga, on their 1982 album 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.\\nBritain\u2019s ambition to be the third power (following the USA and the Soviet Union) to possess thermonuclear weapons led it away from an increasingly unhappy Australia into the waters of the Pacific \u2013 where what is now Kiribati fell under the cross-hairs. This small oceanic nation gained its independence from the UK in 1979 \u2013 but only after it had endured the series of explosions that was Operation Grapple in 1957 and 1958. The procedure saw hydrogen bombs detonated above both Kiritimati and Malden Island \u2013 which sit, respectively, 1,340 miles and 1,760 miles south of the Hawaii capital Honolulu.\\nBoth were, and are, the sort of islands which define the region in popular imagination \u2013 low sands and whispering palms. Both have claims to fame. Kiritimati is better known as Christmas Island \u2013 and, as of a realignment of the International Date Line in 1995, is one of the first places on earth to witness the dawn of a new year. It is not uninhabited \u2013 and, shockingly, wasn\u2019t evacuated during the trials \u2013 its plantation workers left in harm\u2019s way. Operation Dominic \u2013 31 US tests \u2013 also made use of it as Cold War tensions heightened in 1962. Its population has grown significantly since, but the entire island is now a wildlife sanctuary, where birds like the Christmas Island warbler and red-tailed tropicbird thrive.\\nMalden Island was at least free of human footprints when Operation Grapple descended upon it. Or, at least, it was by that point. It is large enough \u2013 some 15 square miles of coral, framing an enclosed lagoon \u2013 that it had sustained life in another era. It was uninhabited when it was \u201cdiscovered\u201d by the American whaler Samuel Bunker in 1825, but ancient ruins on its north and south shores \u2013 21 archaeological sites in total, with the remains of houses, temples and tombs \u2013 talk of an earlier Polynesian civilisation that had moved on long before bigger ships and military airplanes were plotting it on their charts.\\nThe USA had carried its nuclear plans into the Pacific long before Operation Dominic shook the skies. Between 1946 and 1958, it conducted 23 tests at Bikini Atoll, in the Marshall Islands. This was no small endeavour. In the summer of 1946, Operation Crossroads \u2013 the first and most significant part of the early trials \u2013 saw the detonation of the first two nuclear devices since the bombing of Nagasaki a year earlier. It involved the assembly of a ships\u2019 graveyard \u2013 95 warships deemed to be expendable; an enormous fleet \u2013 in the atoll\u2019s lagoon. These were to be metal guinea pigs in experiments to assess the effects of targeting vessels at sea. The first device \u2013 Able \u2013 sank five of them on July 1; the second, Baker, was detonated underwater, and took down another eight on July 25.\\nThe ships were not the only \u201ccasualties\u201d of the tests. The Castle Bravo experiment of March 1 1954 led to sizeable fall-out, showering the people of the surrounding Rongelap Atoll in radioactive ash. Notoriously, the debris also fell onto the 23 crew members of the Japanese fishing boat Daigo Fukuryu Maru (Lucky Dragon No.5), which had the ill fortune to be in the area. The outcry was loud. The ship is now preserved in its own museum in Tokyo \u2013 a quiet protest against nuclear weaponry. Bikini Atoll is much less accessible. Attempts to resettle the local population in 1970 were abandoned by 1980, after high levels of strontium-90 were found in its drinking water. Remarkably, scuba diving was authorised in 1996, allowing \u201cadventurous\u201d souls to inspect the remains of the likes of the USS Anderson, USS Arkansas and USS Saratoga in the depths of the lagoon.\\nThe Ground Zero of nuclear explosions \u2013 near Socorro in this south-western state \u2013 is now safeguarded as a National Historic Landmark. It was here, under the gaze of Robert Oppenheimer, that the Trinity test was conducted on July 16 1945. The site has been on the US heritage list since 1965. However, access is only possible twice a year, on special open days held on the first Saturdays of April and October, as the site is part of the active White Sands Missile Range (see wsmr.army.mil/Trinity/Pages/Home.aspx; the upcoming April open day has been cancelled due to the pandemic). For those who want to sample the harsh geography of the area which gave birth to the nuclear bomb, but cannot make such specific dates, the adjacent White Sands National Park (nps.gov/whsa) is indicative \u2013 its dunes of pale gypsum rising and falling below the ridge of the San Andres Mountains.\\nSome of the most remarkable images of the nuclear age are those which show mushroom clouds in the heavens above the Nevada Test Site \u2013 where the US set off devices for much of the Fifties. That these experiments took place so close to human life \u2013 Las Vegas lies just 100 miles to the south-east \u2013 remains a source of astonishment. Particularly as Sin City revelled in the proximity, holding viewing parties, and even related beauty pageants.\\nLook at it on the map, and you might surmise that, on location alone, Amchitka Island could have started the Third World War. This volcanic outcrop in the northern Pacific has been part of the USA since the Alaska Purchase of 1867. But it is also part of the Aleutian Islands \u2013 the archipelago, arcing like a necklace between continents, that is shared with Russia. Less than 600 miles \u2013 a hop and a skip in terms of the region \u2013 separate it from Bering Island, on the other side of the border. In 1965, when the USA selected Amchitka as a nuclear test site, these two \u201cneighbours\u201d were also on opposite sides of the Cold War.\\nProvocative? Surely. But enormous underground blasts were unleashed in 1965 and 1969 \u2013 and again at the start of the next decade. The Cannikin experiment of November 6 1971 unfurled as an explosion 400 times more powerful than the bomb which eviscerated Hiroshima \u2013 a gut punch to the island that caused landslides, and created a vast new lake.\\nThe Amchitka and Cannikin tests played a direct role in the founding of Greenpeace. Five decades later, radiation levels on the the island are still being carefully monitored, although there are tentative plans to turn it into a wildlife preserve \u2013 by as soon as 2025.", "image": [["A nuclear test at\u00a0Moruroa in 1970", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/travel/2021/03/11/GettyImages-526777000_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq7HJb7Q8i_einS_BXBxlZV0u5SZRWLV6blloSauThRfs.jpg?imwidth=680"], ["Charles de Gaulle watches the 1966 test", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/travel/2021/03/11/GettyImages-104404516_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqFNg083D4dwMls34BZ1qmEyi9y4H_XFzJKW87yDRHwck.jpg?imwidth=350"], ["Rainbow Warrior after being bombed by secret service agents", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/travel/2021/03/11/GettyImages-102779537_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqplGOf-dgG3z4gg9owgQTXPGkjMqXV6CT_ASrwFoxoSc.jpg?imwidth=350"], ["Dummies await\u00a0Gerboise Rouge", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/travel/2021/03/11/GettyImages-3270538_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqKutH9T4LB0mU7ExMWwW8NL5Y1ppsiujAOhqNjaOsRss.jpg?imwidth=350"], ["Algeria's Hoggar Mountains", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/travel/2021/03/11/GettyImages-1183783797_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqjJeHvIwLm2xPr27m7LF8maFSVnA7ljiZGqfHiRYjp5k.jpg?imwidth=350"], ["The aftermath of\u00a0Operation Hurricane", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/travel/2021/03/11/GettyImages-51109362_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.jpg?imwidth=350"], ["The\u00a0Montebello Islands", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/travel/2021/03/11/GettyImages-1129017961_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqjJeHvIwLm2xPr27m7LF8maFSVnA7ljiZGqfHiRYjp5k.jpg?imwidth=350"], ["A road sign points to\u00a0Maralinga", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/travel/2021/03/11/GettyImages-1080255528_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZ_JcPYgesQnahAq0MEErmUdC6hQ-DIbMnE9IrAEJOfE.jpg?imwidth=350"], ["One of Kiribati's many atolls", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/travel/2021/03/11/GettyImages-1187220840_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqEDjTm7JpzhSGR1_8ApEWQA1vLvhkMtVb21dMmpQBfEs.jpg?imwidth=350"], ["Operation Crossroads", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/travel/2021/03/11/GettyImages-568878521_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqGDa2KUuunydmdpV9LzabUg5px7nN3E74DYlHYlYZVA0.jpg?imwidth=350"], ["The wreck of the USS Saratoga", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/travel/2021/03/11/GettyImages-1181634742_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.jpg?imwidth=350"], ["White Sands National Park", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/travel/2021/03/11/GettyImages-1134491369_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqjJeHvIwLm2xPr27m7LF8maFSVnA7ljiZGqfHiRYjp5k.jpg?imwidth=350"], ["Miss Atomic 1957", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/travel/2021/03/04/nevada-miss-atomic_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqbllqV9Ow0absvN5uy-gSAJXjn4lSkLG_-M92pf5Ibys.jpg?imwidth=350"], ["The\u00a0Aleutian Islands", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/travel/2021/03/11/GettyImages-1293782202_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqtGQB12KHxxQCrwnTZkX0nyW0qTysEG4yZuBUdXGakjA.jpg?imwidth=350"]], "author": ["Chris Leadbeater"], "date": "2021-03-11"}}
