Ah yes, we were going to introduce this apparently new car marque 13 years ago, during the 2008 Detroit motor show. \u201cThey\u2019re showing Hyundai\u2019s new premium marque,\u201d I telephoned from a snow-bound Motor City. The editor growled: \u201cAnd is it coming to the UK?\u201d I replied in the negative. \u201cErm, no, they\u2019ve said definitely not.\u201d And that was that.\\nBut never say never in the car industry. Genesis is coming to Blighty now; another attempt to storm a steep hill of \u201cpremiumness\u201d held by the Germans, with this new brand hiding behind the bodies of Nissan\u2019s Infiniti and various other well-intended but ultimately ill-fated assaults.\\nAnd to give the whole adventure credibility, Hyundai has hired a serious bench of ex-German engineers and designers, even if the effect is to make it look like a motor executives\u2019 care home. There\u2019s Luc Donckerwolke (ex-design at VW-owned Bentley, VW itself and Audi-owned Lamborghini), Filippo Perini (ex-design at Lamborghini), Peter Schreyer (ex-design at VW and Audi), Sang-Yup Lee (ex-design at Bentley and GM\u2019s Corvette division), plus Albert Biermann (ex-boss of BMW\u2019s M performance division), along with a handful of assorted ex-Mercedes and Audi vice-presidents and presidents.\\nSo, what have these industry Titans given us?\\nThe Genesis line-up currently consists of a large saloon and a gargantuan SUV, the GV80, which we\u2019ve tested here. This near five-metre-long, 2.3-tonne monster is right in the heart of every green\u2019s hate list and pitched straight into the premier-league Alderley Edge and stockbroker-belt Surrey markets currently enjoying their Audis, Volvos, BMWs, Range Rovers, Volvos and Mercedes-Benzes.\\nLike a lot of premium-market newcomers, the basic shape of the GV80 is simple and far from offensive; there\u2019s even some Sixties Americana in the rear. Trouble is, the managing director\u2019s children have then played pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey with a bag of fatuous detailing: the gormless grille that looks chain-sawed off a retro-themed Chrysler 300, the \u201csergeant\u2019s stripes\u201d running lights which emphasise the massive width, along with chrome strips everywhere.\\nSo, just when you think, \u201cWell that\u2019s a well-finished line, or a decent proportion,\u201d you find a stick-on furbelow of the American golfing-trouser variety.\\nStill, when the Extinction Rebellion revolution comes, they\u2019ll have no trouble finding this particular symbol of envy and hate\u2026\\nWhile some markets get a V6 petrol engine, we get a choice of a 300bhp/311lb ft four-cylinder 2.5-litre turbo petrol or a straight-six 3.0-litre turbo diesel, which will be the biggest seller. With 274bhp and 433lb ft of torque, this version will accelerate from 0-62mph in 7.5sec with a top speed of 143mph. Fuel consumption is quoted at 33.2mpg and we achieved 31mpg travelling round the Chilterns and into Oxfordshire. C02 emissions are quoted at a maximum of 220g/km, which gives a first year VED tax of \u00a31,345.\\nThis diesel version starts at \u00a362,415 so prepare to pay a \u00a3335 \u201cluxury supplement\u201d on the VED for the next five years. Ours also had \u00a314,920 worth of options including a \u00a33,900 Innovation Pack, which includes matrix LED headlights, a head-up display and a 3D instrument cluster. The \u00a31,250 Comfort seat pack includes electrically adjusted, massaging and memory seats, plus a \u00a31,020 Lexicon stereo. So, our \u00a377,355 test car came as a five-seater, but a third row of seats is available as an option to make a seven-seater.\\nCrawl underneath and you can see a set of the finest machined suspension arm forgings you\u2019ll see anywhere in the car industry, with independent multi-link suspension all round and adjustable damping which, like some French DS models, is firmed or slackened according to a camera which reads the road ahead to identify bumps and potholes.\\nStep inside and the style is Rose Gold hell. I didn\u2019t see any onyx, there was plenty of cream leather, light-ash wood finishes, raised stitching and show-off surface changes on the door trims and the dashboard. Genesis calls this colour combination, \u2018vanilla beige\u2019 which sounds less like an interior colour and more like a preference on the Tinder dating website.\\nThe seats are large and electrically powered, including \u201cErgo motion\u201d inflatable air pockets which pump up and down to give a couple of massage functions, along with inflatable side bolsters which pump up when you select the Sport driving mode.\\nThere are lots of storage spaces around the driver, but the door pockets are small and shallow and the flock-lined centre console bin is deep and unlit, so you\u2019ll lose stuff in there.\\nThe instrument binnacle is a 12.5-inch digital item, which is reasonably clear, but the needles on the instruments are very thin and the vaunted 3D function is actually a bit of gimmick.\\nThe 14.5in touchscreen has a sparkly control capstan down in the centre console. It\u2019s all pretty logical to use although since the screen is something of a stretch to reach, the capstan is a welcome extra.\\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, as you might expect, and there\u2019s a lot of software bits and pieces which might or might not be useful. Valet mode, for example, hides your phone and satnav data from prying eyes.\\nAnd as well as a SAE Level 2 semi-self-driving feature (as long as you have your hands on the wheel), the GV80 will also remotely park itself while you hold the keyfob. Engage the indicators and the instrument on the respective side is replaced with a camera view down the side of the vehicle. It\u2019s over-shoulder checks for lazy people, but it might save the odd ill-advised biker or cyclist sneaking up on the inside.\\nThere\u2019s also active road-noise cancellation, which plays the inverse of the tyre roar back at you through the loudspeakers \u2013 we\u2019ll come back to this\u2026\\nViews to the front and sides are clear and the driving position isn\u2019t bad, although I could have done with more rearward adjustment on the steering wheel.\\nIn the back the space around the rear bench is not massive, but I was able to sit behind myself with a bit of spare head and leg room. You\u2019ll get three across in there and the centre tunnel is discreet.\\nAt 735 litres the boot is spacious if high off the ground. Press a button to fold the electrically-powered rear seats and you\u2019ll release 2,152 litres of load volume. The boot floor hides a space for the tonneau which is good, but not for a spare wheel, which is bad.\\nWith five Euro NCAP stars, there are a lot of camera- and radar-based safety systems, including all the usual lanekeeping, forward detection and braking functions, and smart cruise controls, but also a front centre airbag system to protect in case of side impacts and smart steering assistance if the cameras detect vehicles, pedestrians or cyclists in the path of the car and you\u2019ve already taken some steering evasive action.\\nSo, a fine if rather complicated spec, then.\\nStart her up and you\u2019d be forgiven for wondering what the fuss was about with a merry clatter from the all-alloy straight-six diesel, not much of which is damped out before it reaches the interior.\\nIt has plenty of go, though, and a lovely roar as it gathers speed. The Hyundai-built gearbox is smooth and positive although dialling in Sport doesn\u2019t seem to do much to the change quality. There are gearchange paddles behind the steering wheel, but this isn\u2019t really a car that you\u2019d set up for corners on the gearbox.\\nAnd so to the ride, which I\u2019d thought might be a trifle soft for UK tastes; how wrong I was. Despite the evident quality of the components, and the bump-detection system, the body control is awful. At quite moderate speeds, the 22-inch tyres clout every bump and imperfection so faithfully that your posterior can read the casting marks on the man-hole covers.\\nAt 45mph on a modest country road, the body gambols along, floating free, yet feeling quite choppy over bumps with horrible side-to-side head tossing, which made my neck ache. It felt quite vintage and at the same time slightly out of control, like an Austin Seven powered with a Lotus Seven engine.\\nThe steering is direct and reasonably weighted, but completely without feel and the brakes are strong, but likewise the pedal feels dead at the top of the travel.\\nAnd the handling is equally dismal, with a fair bit of pitch and squat from the body under acceleration and braking, plus that almost not-there damping control which allows the body to shudder and corkscrew through bumpy turns.\\nTuned on the Nurburgring, trills the press release, though it then goes on to say they\u2019ve been to the UK. Where? When? I\u2019d vouchsafe that Biermann\u2019s team haven\u2019t driven the kind of roads of the launch route. I drove 600 miles in a new Land Rover Defender Commercial at the weekend and stepped out of it fresh as a daisy; a couple of hours in the GV80 was like going five rounds with Anthony Joshua.\\nYou\u2019ve got to feel for the team involved in this Genesis project, which is a bit like Don Quixote tilting at \u201chulking giants\u201d which, as Sancho Panza his faithful squire points out, are actually windmills. Lexus has just about established itself in Europe, Peugeot Citro\u00ebn\u2019s DS brand is struggling to make its mark, Nissan\u2019s Infiniti quit Dodge and Honda\u2019s Acura never came over here.\\nSo it\u2019s here because it\u2019s here, but don\u2019t be too quick to fall for the hyped-up Genesis experience complete with concierge, five-year warranty and courtesy cars.\\nDrive it first, because I think just half a mile up the road you\u2019ll be wishing you\u2019d bought something else. Anything else, in fact.\\nThe Genesis GV80 3D's specifications you should know:\\nTested: 2,996cc, straight-six-cylinder turbodiesel, eight-speed automatic gearbox, four-wheel drive\nPrice/on sale:\u00a0from \u00a362,415 (\u00a377,335 as tested)/July\nPower/torque:\u00a0\u00a0274bhp @ 3,800rpm/433lb ft @ 1,500rpm\nTop speed: 143mph\u00a0\nAcceleration: 0-62mph in 7.5sec\nFuel consumption: 33.2mpg (WLTP Combined), 31mpg on test\nCo2 emissions:\u00a0220g/km (Combined)\u00a0\nVED: \u00a31,345 first year, \u00a3490 next five years, then \u00a3155\\nVerdict: They\u2019re doing all they can to create a legend for this new Hyundai-owned premium marque and they\u2019ve got to at least try in Europe because not to is to put the mark of Cain on these cars as far as credibility in the American and far eastern markets.\\nBut despite some good technology and a likeable if loquacious diesel unit, the dynamics of this huge SUV are simply not good enough compared with the very capable non-German opposition, let alone the Germans themselves.\\nRemember that price, because things get mightily expensive mightily fast in the Volvo showroom. This near five-metre-long, five- or seven-seat SUV is a lovely thing to ride in and drive. In the 20 years since launch it\u2019s been updated with new style and software but the portrait-format touchscreen feels a bit dated these days.\\nSoft, comfortable and well built, the 4.9-metre long RX450h has a powerful V6 petrol self-charging hybrid drivetrain but it can\u2019t match the C02 figures of its plug-in hybrid rivals. Nor does the hybrid give of its best on long journeys. Available with five and seven seats, it looks amazing, but underneath it\u2019s less than stellar to drive.\\nThe mild hybrid version of the Wolverhampton-built straight-six turbodiesel is a great power unit and with the ZF eight-speed automatic gearbox makes the good-looking, fine-riding Velar a fleet and relaxed all-weather mile muncher.\\nFor new and used buying guides, tips and expert advice,\u00a0visit our Advice section, or sign up to our newsletter\u00a0here\\nTo talk all things motoring with the Telegraph Cars team join the Telegraph Motoring Club Facebook group here\\nA-Z Car Finder", "image": [["This large SUV from a new premium marque rides into battle against some stellar German opposition", "www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/images/2021/06/15/TELEMMGLPICT000261322067_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqXImAYQktYjIsW3moNlipdpkizuSC_HoGiMUCRqJ3Hpo.jpeg?imwidth=680"], ["C02 emissions are quoted at a maximum of 220g/km, which gives a first year VED tax of \u00a31,345", "www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/images/2021/06/15/TELEMMGLPICT000261322095_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpfdAlaR4Ea_iSpZSotji0OsABZALI9xB27mSuRuJI98.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["Vanilla beige: which sounds less like an interior colour and more like a preference on the Tinder dating website", "www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/images/2021/06/15/TELEMMGLPICT000261322087_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqcCUlY4ecowelYv5R9cM4VzlaTMTxUhlzF8Rkw038U-A.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["All the cool tools:\u00a014.5in touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and\u00a0Android Auto", "www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/images/2021/06/15/TELEMMGLPICT000261322019_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["Stylish with no substance:\u00a0there\u2019s a lot of software bits and pieces which might or might not be useful", "www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/images/2021/06/15/TELEMMGLPICT000261322078_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwRMWbYwzrg_3PLcMwCu9G8U.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["No space for a spare wheel: the boot is not all it seems to be", "www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/images/2021/06/15/TELEMMGLPICT000261322097_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqwD2sfO9joeQ6RY-qlTATNDlaTMTxUhlzF8Rkw038U-A.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["A couple of hours in the GV80 is like going five rounds with Anthony Joshua", "www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/images/2021/06/15/TELEMMGLPICT000261322084_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq900leoZVuq6ru6F43OqP_jlaTMTxUhlzF8Rkw038U-A.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["The Volvo XC90", "www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/images/2021/06/15/TELEMMGLPICT000136534876_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq900leoZVuq6ru6F43OqP_jlaTMTxUhlzF8Rkw038U-A.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["The\u00a0Range Rover Velar D300 R-Dynamic HSE", "www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/images/2021/06/15/TELEMMGLPICT000142243743_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=350"]], "author": ["Andrew English"], "date": "2021-06-15"}, "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/06/20/chris-packham-accused-hypocrisy-lord-botham-backing-xr-long/": {"title": "Chris Packham hits back at claims of long-haul 'eco-hypocrisy' in clash with Lord Botham", "subtitle": "Packham, the popular presenter of BBC\u2019s Springwatch, has become XR\u2019s biggest celebrity cheerleader and is a regular at its protests", "text": "Chris Packham has hit back at allegations of hypocrisy after Lord Botham highlighted the presenter\u2019s support for both Extinction Rebellion (XR) and long-distance air travel.\\nPackham, the popular presenter of the BBC\u2019s Springwatch, has become XR\u2019s biggest celebrity cheerleader and is a regular at its protests. In an interview last year, he proclaimed XR\u00a0\u201cthe first real hope of making a bigger difference\u201d.\\nBut it has emerged that Packham appears to have been an avid supporter of long distance aviation, promoting exotic and adventurous holidays to all corners of the planet.\\nPackham\u2019s links to the travel industry have been highlighted by Lord Botham, the former England cricket captain turned charity campaigner, who is concerned that environmental policies could push millions of people into \u201cgreen poverty\u201d.\\nWriting in The Telegraph last week, Lord Botham said: \u201cChris promotes holidays for the rich that encourage people to go on very long flights to places like Botswana, Peru and the Falkland Islands. Flights which create eye-watering emissions.\u201d\\nHe added: \u201cPackham is guilty of grotesque eco-hypocrisy\u201d.\\nIn response, Packham said Lord Botham\u2019s criticism was part of a longstanding grudge he had against him over the divisive issue of game shooting. Lord Botham is an ardent supporter, while the television presenter has called for grouse shooting to be banned.\\nPackham told The Telegraph he had participated in a number of adventure or eco-tourism holidays over the years but resolved not to undertake any more in the future.\\nFor example, Packham has acted as a guide for holidaymakers on a \u00a314,000 per person trip to Papua New Guinea, an 11-day cruise on the \u201cexceptional True North Boat\u201d, run by Steppes Travel, a specialist company that \u201ccarefully creates pioneering journeys in the world\u2019s far-flung places\u201d.\\nThe present and environmental campaigner has also travelled with Steppes to Alaska in November 2019 producing a photo diary reproduced on its website and in its magazine.\\nThe company acknowledges the \u2018climate emergency\u2019 and says it is working \u201cto reduce our carbon footprint\u201d.\\nPackham also admits to having done \u201clots of trips tour guiding\u201d for another firm Spencer Scott Travel in Cuba, Peru, South Africa, Botswana and Uganda. \u201cCheck them out if you want something special,\u201d says Packham on Spencer Scott Travel\u2019s website that includes a link to his own personal homepage.\\nPackham has also previously led birdwatching tours for \u201cover a decade\u201d in The Gambia for another travel firm; and was billed as the leader of a \u00a37,000 per person tour of South Georgia and the Falklands for a trip due to have taken place before the pandemic hit in November 2020. He was also involved with a US firm Responsible Travel undertaking tours of Antarctica.\\nXR has regularly carried out direct action protests at airports, disrupting holiday travel plans for thousands of families, as well as business passengers. One of XR\u2019s founders Roger Hallam has branded flying a \u2018no no\u2019, and compared it to eating meat.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a physical fact that it\u2019s beyond bad,\u201d Mr Hallam once said in a podcast with Flight Free UK, which encourages people to take a pledge to stop flying. Other members of the group - recognising the need for some air travel to see relatives who live abroad and other necessary trips - have called for strict rationing.\\nThe group itself has no stated policy on flying - it does not advocate an outright ban for example - but a spokesman has said \u201cit is self-evident\u2026 that the expansion of aviation and the rate of flying is inconsistent with our first and second demands\u201d which is for governments \u201cto tell the truth on the climate and act immediately\u201d.\\nPackham\u2019s links to the travel industry were highlighted by Lord Botham as part of what he said was a campaign to speak out against \u201cgreen poverty\u201d, resulting from environmental policies that could force people to replace petrol cars and gas boilers, as well as \u00a0jobs lost to overseas competitors.\\nHe calculated that 36 passengers on a trip to Papua New Guinea, flying from London via Australia, would have to plant 18,000 trees to absorb 360 tonnes of CO2.\\nPackham told the Telegraph that Lord Botham \u201cseeks every opportunity he can to undermine my integrity and credibility\u201d.\\nHe said he had \u201cnot seen an airport, like everyone else\u201d for the past 18 months. He said Lord Botham was accusing him of being a \u201chypocrite\u201d but he was wrong to claim that.\\nHe also said he did not fully support XR. \u201cI like aspects of XR but bear in mind it is a decentralised unit, there are things they do which I don\u2019t support,\u201d he said, \u201cThey are not a one size fits all outfit.\u201d\\nPackham said the tour to Papua new Guinea had taken place more than five years ago and he had not visited Gambia, where he had first gone on a regular basis in 1986, for three to four years.\\nPackham added: \u201cI cannot get involved in every public dispute with Ian Botham.
