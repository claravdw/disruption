Humanity\u2019s growing numbers had become \u201ctoo burdensome\u201d, he fretted, \u201cthe elements scarcely suffice for our support\u201d. The only solution, he feared, was to \u201cprune the overgrowth\u201d via pestilence, famine and war.\\nGiven that Tertullian\u2019s home city of Carthage was among the world\u2019s largest at the time, his jitters were perhaps understandable. However, at roughly 500,000, Carthage was still barely the size of modern-day Edinburgh. And courtesy of \u201cpruning\u201d by events such as the Black Death and the Thirty Years\u2019 War, the world\u2019s population did not grow that much until the Industrial Revolution, 1,500 years later.\\nYet as the demographer Paul Morland points out in Tomorrow\u2019s \u00adPeople, Tertullian was merely kick-starting a long tradition of population pessimism \u2013 most famously upheld by the economist Thomas Malthus, who wrongly feared that humanity\u2019s capacity to multiply would outstrip its capacity to feed itself. So here, first of all, is Morland\u2019s good news.\\nDespite the world\u2019s population being nearly eight billion, it is likely to peak this century at around 11 billion, as better life expectancy and living standards in the developing world reduce the need for large families. Climate change catastrophes notwithstanding, he says, that figure can be sustainable.\\nWhat is less reassuring is that while some countries\u2019 populations may go up, others may die out altogether. Take Japan \u2013 now nicknamed the \u201cland of the setting sun\u201d, because its ageing population is expected to shrink by a fifth over the next half-century.\\nNot enough young Japanese want to have children, nor is Japan keen to admit migrants, meaning the once-crowded suburbs of Tokyo could become \u201cmini-Detroits\u201d. Western nations have the same problem, especially more conservative countries such as Italy, where women are still discouraged from juggling a career with children. Faced with that binary choice, Morland says, many opt for \u201can interesting job rather than motherhood\u201d. He notes: \u201cJust as there are no more Visigoths, there is no guarantee that there will be any Italians or Japanese.\u201d\\nFacing the opposite challenge is much of sub-Saharan Africa, where a population boom caused by falling child mortality has not yet been offset by a reduction to the two-child family model now common elsewhere. By 2100, the region will account for one in three people in the world (compared with one in 14 in 1950).\\nYet even now, the likes of Nigeria, whose population is expected to double to 400 million by 2050, has nothing like enough jobs to go round. With Europe tightening its borders to African migration, the continent will need an \u201cextraordinary feat of human development\u201d to avoid conflict and chaos.\\nMorland is illuminating on how the ebbs and flows of population can influence history. Individuals may start wars and revolutions, but sheer force of numbers adds an under\u00adlying seismic pressure. Russia\u2019s rapid birth rate at the turn of the last century, for example, was one reason that Germany viewed it as such a threat.\\nBy the 1960s, though, Russians were having fewer children than most Western nations, thus speeding the Soviet Union\u2019s decline. Today, Russia\u2019s population is shrinking like Japan\u2019s, thanks partly to appalling male alcoholism rates.\\nYouthful societies are often turbulent, thanks to the numbers of young, childless males with little to lose. This, Morland says, was a common factor in many of the world\u2019s great upheavals, from the Bolshevik revolutions to the Arab Spring. By contrast, the terror campaigns in Northern Ireland and Spain\u2019s Basque region ended partly because ageing populations had \u201csapped the energy\u201d from the conflicts.\\nMorland\u2019s book is a concise chronicle of our global breeding habits, as deft with social context as it is with figures. Given how climate change concerns have politicised the issue of population, it\u2019s very topical. The Duke of Sussex, for example, has said he will have no more than two children.\\nThe more radical eco-activists of the so-called \u201cbirth-striker\u201d movement plan to have none at all. Indeed, as Morland notes: \u201cThe worry is that eventually the human race will be at risk of disappearing altogether.\u201d On that point, we may have to hope that, just like Malthus and Tertullian before him, Morland turns out to be wrong.\\nTomorrow\u2019s People by Paul Morland is published by Picador at \u00a320.

Its self-declared initial aim is an immediate end to new fossil-fuel investments, and it has been actively recruiting those prepared to engage in \u201ccivil disobedience\u201d. Last month, two supporters delivered a verbal and written ultimatum to Downing Street giving the Government a deadline of this Monday to comply or \u201cit will be our duty to intervene \u2013 to prevent the ultimate crime against our country, humanity and life on earth\u201d. One of the pair was Louis McKechnie, 21, the orange-clad activist who tied himself to the goalposts on Thursday. The mechanical engineering student was recently released from jail for taking part in court injunction-breaking road blockades with\u00a0Insulate Britain.\\nSunday\u2019s British Academy Film Awards was the first major event to be disrupted \u2013 hours before the Just Stop Oil deadline \u2013 with activists staging a sit-in on the red carpet. But the Premier League arguably has an even bigger profile and the act of tying oneself to a goalpost was always likely to go viral. The protests at the Everton match and the Arsenal-Liverpool game the previous evening were also followed by slick videos uploaded to Just Stop Oil\u2019s social-media accounts alongside posts justifying the action. One read: \u201cSorry to have interrupted your game, but no one listens unless we do crazy s--- like this. This beautiful game, like your lives, will be disrupted by increasingly extreme weather events in the years to come.\u201d\\nPublic threats of that nature have yet to be made but football and other televised major sports should brace themselves, amid warnings the campaign will step up next month. Saturday\u2019s FA Cup quarter-finals could be the next big target given they are on the BBC and ITV and may generate the British TV\u2019s largest audiences this year. It is also the final weekend of the Six Nations, with Wales hosting Italy in Cardiff. England also travel to France, while the Formula 1 season gets under-way in Bahrain, although activists would appear unlikely to get on a plane given their aims and would doubtless not want to spend time in a foreign jail.\\nBeyond the Government caving in to the group's demands, it is near-impossible to stop a protestor determined enough to disrupt a sporting event. Security staff will doubtless be on the lookout for obvious signs someone is a Just Stop Oil supporter and more effort could be made to tackle any pitch invaders before they manage to attach themselves to the likes of a goalpost. Unlike with the crowd trouble football has witnessed recently, the threat of a football banning order would be unlikely to act as any kind of deterrent to an activist.", "image": [["A protestor interrupted Everton's dramatic win over Newcastle on Thursday night", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2022/03/18/TELEMMGLPICT000000289814499_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqAblP_nApRBgTXVGqwDG3FtHhMh81Y8GqX3ipA8YMo0k.jpeg?imwidth=680"]], "author": ["Ben Rumsby"], "date": "2022-03-18"}, "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/interviews/blasphemous-metal-band-ghost-became-acceptable-face-satanism/": {"title": "\u2018Blasphemous\u2019: how metal band Ghost became the acceptable face of Satanism", "subtitle": "Fronted by 'anti-Pope' Tobias Forge, Ghost are one of the world's heaviest stadium bands \u2013 and it's all thanks to Andrew Lloyd Webber", "text": "Tobias Forge wants you to know that \u201cDeath metal has always been a very humanistic thing. When we\u2019re talking about darkness, death, despair, it\u2019s to express our discontent at the world. It\u2019s our way to explain how s___ things are\u201d. The 41-year-old mastermind behind Ghost has spent the last 12 years taking influences from the murky underground worlds of black metal and mixing it with radio friendly pop. The result is something that\u2019s as much ABBA as it is Cradle Of Filth.\\nThey\u2019ve been touted as future Download Festival headliners, have supported Foo Fighters, Metallica and Iron Maiden in stadiums around the world and they\u2019ll be supporting the release of fifth album Impera with a European arena headline tour of their own. Almost three million people listen to them every month on Spotify, with the band appealing to lifelong punks and metalheads while also acting as a glam introduction to the world of heavy music. In a scene full of legacy acts, Ghost are the sound of the future.\\nFor the first half of their career though, no one even knew who was in Ghost. On stage the band were led by demonic anti-Pope character Papa Emeritus or one of his successors (one for every album) while the band was made up of a gaggle of \u201cnameless ghouls\u201d who also handled interviews. It was even rumoured that Foo Fighters\u2019 Dave Grohl was an occasional member of the gang.\\nThen in 2017 those nameless ghouls filed a lawsuit over unpaid profits, revealing Tobias Forge\u2019s identity as the man in charge. The case was dismissed and fortunately, Forge took his unmasking in his stride. \u201cI\u2019ve read every classic rock biography of every band I\u2019m a fan of [and] the same s___ takes place in every single one,\u201d he said at the time.\\nThen, as if to prove there was more to the band than mystery, he wrote 2018\u2019s brilliant, synth-driven Prequelle: a record of survival set in the mediaeval plague era. It went on to elevate the band even further and was nominated for the Best Rock Album at the 61st Grammys (their second Grammy award after winning Best Metal Performance in 2016).\\n\u201cI am as much of an exhibitionist as anyone else who has ever put on a guitar and walked onstage but I like the idea of being able to step in and out of my celebrity,\u201d says Forge, explaining the reason for Papa Emeritus. \u201cIf Bono comes to dinner, you\u2019d expect a long spiel about Greenpeace. I don\u2019t have to be that person, but I still get to play a rock star.\u201d\\nStadiums, award ceremonies and talk of stardom are a world away from where Forge started his musical career. Aged 15, he joined his first DIY punk band and spent the next few years experimenting with death metal and alternative rock in a variety of underground bands. \u201cThere\u2019s a natural limiter on how successful you can become, playing extreme metal,\u201d Forge tells me over Zoom, a day off from a US co-headline tour with Danish rock band Volbeat.\\nHe formed Ghost in 2006 as a way to combine traditional rock (he\u2019d grown up idolising The Doors, The Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd) his love of theatre (The Phantom Of The Opera and Cats have both been hugely influential, with Forge calling Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s musicals \u201cmind-blowing\u201d) and the horror and darkness of death metal. The result is something flamboyant, dramatic and, he adds, \u201cwith a lot more visual elements than your average grunge band.\u201d\\n\u201cWithout the music, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten anywhere,\u201d says Forge. \u201cI know a lot of bands that look cool, but suck.\u201d Ghost released spooky debut single Elizabeth in 2010 without any press photos \u201cto let the music do the talking\u201d and signed a deal soon after. Debut album Opus Eponymous followed later that year. While most other occult rock bands were happy to \u201cstay on the carpet, as we say in Sweden\u201d Forge wanted more. \u201cMy background might be in underground punk but I never wanted to limit us.\u201d\\nBlending rock, prog and metal with Eurodisco and 1980s pop, as well as taking influence from the gothic worlds of Tim Burton\u2019s Batman and Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula, new album Impera is about the self-destruction of society. Played out against the backdrop of Victorian England, it\u2019s another leap forward for Forge \u2013 even if society appeared to be crumbling as he created it. \u201cWhen I was writing Prequelle\u201d says Forge, \u201cthe world was in a relatively stable place but I wasn\u2019t in a good place mentally. For Impera, I was in a way better place but the world was in complete disarray.\u201d\\nThe album also sees the band engage with life more directly, a change in direction from Ghost\u2019s early albums dealing in fantasy and escapism. Sure, the stories told on driving metal anthem Twenties (a rebellious call to arms against the disparity between social classes) and the wailing Driftwood (about religious hypocrisy) are set over a hundred years ago but their messages are relevant today.\\nEpic closing track Respite On The Spitalfields talks about the fear Jack The Ripper stirred in Victorian England, and how the fact he was never caught meant women were afraid to walk the streets of London after dark. Sound familiar? Throughout Impera Forge sings about the abuse of power.\\n\u201cThat abuse of power is the central mechanism that corrodes, but also builds societies,\u201d Forge says. \u201cWe like to think we\u2019re so enlightened in this modern world but right now, people believe in taking away other people\u2019s rights, rather than the opposite. It\u2019s all to do with control and money. Politicians are pro-life not because of their religious beliefs, but because if you have a baby, you\u2019re going to stay in one place and buy s___ like a good little capitalist.\u201d\\nThat said, Impera is an optimistic record, all pomp and empowerment. From the wailing guitar riffs of opening track Kaiserion to the thundering reassurance of the anthemic Call Me Little Sunshine, Ghost\u2019s fifth album is a constantly surprising, consistently brilliant listen that\u2019ll appeal to both the mosh pit, and the theatre stalls.\\n\u201cI believe in karma,\u201d says Forge. \u201cI believe that the bad empires, the ones that are actively trying to destroy the world, will fail. Especially if they\u2019re based on some crazy person who is trying to go against the will of the people,\u201d he adds, weeks before Putin mobilised.\\nForge explains that \u201cpop culture has always been a symbol for freedom\u201d. MeToo and the Black Lives Matter movements were driven by protest songs and lyrics were often the source of snappy slogans painted on banners. Even the Ukrainian resistance to the Russian invasion has taken on Twisted Sister\u2019s 1984 hit We're Not Gonna Take It as one of their unofficial anthems.\\n\u201cThe reason we don\u2019t tour certain places of the world is that they would refuse us, because of what we sing about,\u201d says Forge. Ghost has never played a show in China, and has also faced issues in America. Their second album Infestissumam was delayed because four different US manufacturers refused to print its \u201cblasphemous\u201d artwork \u2013 a 16th-century depiction of an orgy \u2013 while in 2018 a horrified Texan pastor led a protest outside their \u201cdevil-worshipping\u201d show.\\nBut Forge does not worship the devil, and has said that his views are more aligned with modern-day Satanism, which is centred around atheism, scientific scepticism and a passion for wildlife and nature. \u201cI believe in pop culture, in freedom and in being kind. I believe in people having fun, and that they have the right to put their genitals into whomever consents. I believe that love is stronger than hate,\u201d he says.\\nBacked by an eight-piece band, Forge will launch Impera with an arena tour of the UK and Europe. It\u2019s set to be Ghost\u2019s most ambitious run of shows yet \u2013 and that\u2019s saying something.\u00a0 \u201cEverything is about the live show. That\u2019s where you\u2019re making memories with people. I compare a lot of what we do, with what I\u2019ve experienced as a fan of other bands. \u201c\\nHowever, according to Forge, \u201ceverything we ever do is always a lesser version of what I intended it to be.\u201d He\u2019s been sketching out stage shows and plans for world domination since before Ghost had even released a song. \u201cWe\u2019re still working off that to-do list.\u201d\\n\u201cFrom the outside, it might look like our success has happened overnight but it\u2019s taken us years to get to where we are today,\u201d Forge continues. \u201cCompared to AC/DC though, we still feel like a new band. We\u2019ve got plenty of improvements to make before it\u2019s time to throw in the towel.\u201d\\nImpera is out now; Ghost's arena tour begins on April 9 in Manchester", "image": [["'I know a lot of bands that look cool, but suck': Ghost's Tobias Forge", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/music/2022/03/16/TELEMMGLPICT000289637341_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqDBIybpdE1hZc--J4Ymnp2mQnZJIETfWB_fUbKb77n0w.jpeg?imwidth=680"], ["Tobias Forge, lead singer of death metal band Ghost", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/music/2022/03/16/TELEMMGLPICT000000289632406_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqb9plNS0celYuCpnIwI5tgtM3_-3FdFhwSfyVAvXGIsU.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["Forge as Papa Emeritus II", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/music/2022/03/16/TELEMMGLPICT000289637353_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6niF2KNk0jL6WvblntmDzVHwtdpQwyNje2OyIL7x97s.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["Ghost arrive at the 58th Grammy awards ceremony", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/music/2022/03/16/TELEMMGLPICT000000289631337_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqU0jHSj23-rqgtcFc9pglTq1UDbDdk-JPjedL466dDsg.jpeg?imwidth=350"]], "author": ["Ali Shutler"], "date": "2022-03-16"}}
