In fact, she and her tattered banner provided a quiet moment in a show that otherwise fizzed with fashion pyrotechnics.\\nIt was all watched by a glittering crowd including the actress Jennifer Connolly, Call My Agent\u2019s Isabelle Huppert, Bridgerton\u2019s Phoebe Dynevor and Catherine Deneuve, the original Belle de Jour, who is ageing gracefully and vaping enthusiastically.\\nThey\u2019re celebrating 200 years since the birth of Louis Vuitton himself this year, and so Nicolas Ghesquiere, the Maison\u2019s creative director and reigning Napoleon of fashion, decided to fling open the dressing-up trunk and mine the archive for a selection of greatest hits through the ages.\\nThe outfits had a Bridgerton energy and theatricality and a simultaneous respect for, and disdain of, the past. There were sweeping Maleficent capes in white, black and polka dots. There were chiffon gowns with gigantic panniers, tail coats worn over skinny jeans and \u201820s beaded flapper dresses embroidered to couture levels of detail. Elaborate masks and Baroque dark glasses provided an Eyes Wide Shut naughtiness. This was appropriate as the show took place in the Passage Richelieu, a hidden corridor of the Louvre down which Louis Vuitton would go to appointments with the Empress Eugenie during the height of the Second Empire.\\nMonsieur Vuitton was providing his Imperial patroness with made-to-order luggage. These days, his eponymous business focuses on smaller leather goods, namely handbags. And Ghesquiere sent a kaleidoscopic array of bags down the runway. Next season\u2019s high streets may not be overrun by women in panniers, but the handbags - tiny versions of the trademark trunk - \u00a0will be a hit.\\nThe Louis Vuitton show attracted by far the highest celebrity headcount of the whole of Fashion Month. Equally enormous crowds of spectators thronged as close as they could get to the barriers protecting the Pyramid in the courtyard of the Louvre museum, hoping to catch a glimpse of the chandelier-lit glamour within. For once, it didn\u2019t disappoint.", "image": [["Louis Vuitton spring / summer 2022", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/fashion/2021/10/06/GettyImages-1345027104_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpg?imwidth=680"], ["Phoebe Dynevor and Catherine Deneuve attend the Louis Vuitton catwalk show in Paris", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/fashion/2021/10/06/FotoJet_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.jpg?imwidth=350"], ["Louis Vuitton spring / summer 2022", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/fashion/2021/10/06/FotoJet-1_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqgCXocDQF5kP7s3jSjli3eCH0-jRUT4rHK8EgtaGoQwQ.jpg?imwidth=350"]], "author": ["Sasha Slater"], "date": "2021-10-06"}, "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/art/artists/anti-woke-rebellion-has-begun-arts-have-bigger-problem/": {"title": "The anti-woke rebellion has begun \u2013 but the arts have a bigger problem", "subtitle": "A new report aims to help museums and galleries navigate the culture wars. But first these institutions must reject our culture of offence", "text": "Who would be the head of an art gallery, or curator of a museum, today? As well as worrying about getting punters through the door, or finding \u201cunproblematic\u201d benefactors without being assailed by Extinction Rebellion, our cultural institutions have a new worry: they now have to stay in step with contemporary political \u201csensitivities\u201d.\\nFrom the removal of statues to the renaming of streets, many institutions are now being pulled between campaigners wielding social-media pressure, who demand that \u201coffensive\u201d works linked to historical wrongs such as slavery or sexism be removed, and the Government, which has, of late, started dipping its toe into this particular culture war, and demands that they stay.\\nAn ongoing battle in Hoxton, east London, typifies this situation. Protests outside the Geffrye Museum (recently renamed the Museum of the Home), supported by Labour MP Diane Abbott and Black Lives Matter groups, have called for the removal of a statue of Sir Robert Geffrye, the museum\u2019s benefactor. Having been involved in the Atlantic slave-trade, even part-owning a slave ship called the China Merchant, the funds Geffrye used to build the original buildings in which the museum sits were created off the back of tobacco plantations and slave labour.\\nYet the Museum\u2019s director Sonia Solicari received a letter from then-culture secretary Oliver Dowden, reminding the museum to \u201ccontinue to act impartially, in line with your publicly funded status, and not in a way that brings this into question\u201d. The Museum compromised with a plan to \u201cretain and explain\u201d the statue with information about Geffrye\u2019s ill-gotten gains.\\nToday, a new report, led by Trevor Phillips for the think-tank Policy Exchange, has published a series of \u201cprinciples\u201d to help institutions such as the Museum of the Home and cultural gatekeepers like Solicari navigate these demands for change. The report suggests that any changes made to the makeup of public institutions and their works should be run through a \u201cdecision-making body\u201d made up of \u201cthe institution\u2019s management as well as governors or trustees\u201d and that while consultation with the public or other groups is necessary, \u201cno external body \u2013 whether a pressure group, the Government or an external commission\u201d should have the final \u201cauthority\u201d over whether to rename or remove historical artefacts.\\nThe report also demands that institutions stick to their \u201ccore stated functions\u201d. A museum that was founded to ensure the \u201ctransmission of knowledge\u2026 maintenance of public heritage\u2026 or the display of national history\u201d should stick to that, and not \u201cexceed its custodial function\u201d. Finally, the report argues that any change should take into account \u201ckey stakeholders\u201d \u2013 ie. the tax-paying public \u2013 before sending off for a big shipment of new plaques confessing all its benefactors\u2019 sins.\\nPhillips and his researchers are to be commended for highlighting how undemocratic and unaccountable some of the pushes for institutional change have been. (Galleries and councils have whipped away pieces after a whiff of Twitter controversy.) But we need more than technical measures to deal with the new war on history.\\nThe report rightly highlights the danger of setting precedents off the back of political pressure: if we can change the wishes of benefactors because we don\u2019t agree with their morals or choices, why would any rich person fork out for a new wing to the Tate today, if they imagine their name might only last until the next culture war? But more bureaucratic handwringing will not answer the question of why some are so obsessed with erasing history in the first place.\\nThe reason why many of our institutions are having trouble with their history is not because society is in the midst of a mid-life crisis, hoping to rid itself of its dodgy past and start afresh. Instead, we\u2019re living through a period of exceptional intolerance and cowardice, in which authoritative bodies feel unable to argue in defence of the importance of protecting all history \u2013 both the honourable and the shameful.\\nDiscussions about how we remember historical events should be nuanced, flexible and moveable. This is particularly true in the domain of art, which draws its energy and excitement from being in conversation with its public. But when \u201coffence\u201d is the reason for change, the momentum becomes less an interaction with the world around us, and more a reflection of a fragile internal world of narcissism. Should we listen to every individual who\u2019s offended by a piece of work \u2013 such as the punter who lobbied the Rottingdean Heritage Art Gallery to remove an artwork that contained the phrase \u201cCovid is a scam\u201d because they found it \u201cquite upsetting\u201d?\\nMuch like the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Bill, which seeks to legislate universities out of the crisis of campus censorship, the growing cowardice among cultural institutions can\u2019t be box-ticked away with a few regulations about consulting trustees. As shown recently by the Royal Academy of Arts and other institutions making knee-jerk decisions after accusations of \u201ctransphobia\u201d, much of the problem with the war on history and free speech exists within the walls of the institutions themselves, not outside on the placards of a few grumbling protesters.\\nUntil we start questioning our contemporary culture of offence, in which subjective emotions are accepted as the basis for huge public and cultural change, we won\u2019t be saved by all the consultations in the world.", "image": [["The statue of Sir Robert Jeffrye has thus far survived activist rage in east London", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/art/2021/10/25/TELEMMGLPICT000260915465_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq9M48Wd-QdBomgt__diCu-k8FchWZRD3tSYOiRwPjWDo.jpeg?imwidth=680"], ["A new report on the topic has been led by Trevor Phillips", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/art/2021/10/25/TELEMMGLPICT000006247857_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqCHco2f1jjYcmYrb_Lt46Uq1UDbDdk-JPjedL466dDsg.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["The artist Jess de Wahls had her work removed by the RA", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/art/2021/10/25/TELEMMGLPICT000262114526_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf-0Jyi0jPPD6Zx1hiwTPhlc.jpeg?imwidth=350"]], "author": null, "date": "2021-10-25"}, "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/10/07/not-perfect-says-insulate-britain-protester-photos-emerge-10000/": {"title": "Insulate Britain protester Cameron Ford admits 'I'm not perfect' after photos emerge of his 10,000-mile holiday", "subtitle": "The eco-activist, who helped to block roads on the M25, drove from Cambridge to Poland in a diesel van after a four-month stint in Canada", "text": "An Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain activist embarked on a 10,000-mile, four-month long holiday and toured across Europe in a diesel van last year, new photos have revealed.\\nCameron Ford gained infamy last month after spending his 31st birthday in a police cell after blocking roads on the M25 and being dragged away by officers.\\nThe carpenter from Whittlesford, Cambridge, remained unapologetic for the disruption to motorists, commenting at the time: \u201cI hope by causing disruption through civil disobedience that we can get our message across.\u201d\\nMr Ford attended a series of XR protests hosted in the capital two years ago as part of the \u201ccommunity support team\u201d, bringing nappies and bottles of water to the activists.\\nMeanwhile, a Keynsham-based branch of XR gave their backing to Mr Ford, describing him in a Facebook post as \u201celoquent, reasonable and wholly on the right side of history\u201d.\\nHowever, new photos have emerged reportedly showing Mr Ford indulging in globe-trotting holidays across Canada and Europe.\\nPhotographs, first published by the Mail Online, reveal the activist embarked on a four-month holiday across Canada in the autumn of 2019, potentially involving a round trip of 8,500 miles in flights.\\nHe toured across Canada, posting a flurry of photos on social media showing him ice bathing and sledging.\\nIt is believed he travelled at least 1,500 miles within Canada during the jaunt, which could amount to a total of 10,000 miles travelled.\\nAfter returning to the UK in January 2020, he reportedly bought a diesel-powered Citroen van and took another holiday in Europe.

These people have been doing it quietly for years", "text": "It\u2019s really irritating, the Queen was overheard complaining recently, when people talk and don\u2019t do. She is thought to have been referring to the lack of commitment to the upcoming Cop26 climate change summit in Glasgow, where global leaders are meeting to negotiate a new deal to stall rising global temperatures. \u201cExtraordinary, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019ve been hearing all about Cop\u2026 I still don\u2019t know who\u2019s coming. No idea,\u201d she fumed to the Duchess of Cornwall and Elin Jones, presiding officer of the Welsh Parliament, at the opening of the Senedd.\\nAs someone who has already made huge changes to the way she lives to save energy and the planet, one can understand the monarch\u2019s frustration. Long before sustainability was a buzzword, the Queen was embracing energy efficient LED lighting, renewable energy, electric cars, beehives and bug hotels. During a tour of the Edinburgh Climate Change Institute earlier this year, she made clear her belief that climate change means \u201cwe are going to have to change the way we do things\u201d.\\nThe very real threat of hotter temperatures, rising sea levels and life-threatening weather patterns would, one would think, make any leader show up to the party. Yet turning a blind eye is an age-old habit. As the Earl of Devon, a keen environmentalist, points out, we\u2019ve known since 1780 that the empire was destroying the natural world. \u201cThe early pioneers knew it but we forgot,\u201d he says. \u201cWe managed to hide it, packaging consumption into the third world. We were too amazed by all the treasures we were exploiting from the landscape. It\u2019s fascinating to look at historic forgetfulness \u2013 climate change is something we\u2019ve chosen to ignore.\u201d\\nAfter taking over his family seat, Powderham Castle, six years ago, Lord Devon has come to the conclusion that when it comes to living more sustainably we need to look back in order to move forwards. \u201cWe might have invented the iPad but we\u2019re still using land in the same way,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we can learn from the past.\u201d He takes inspiration from the farming and building practices of his ancestors, but also from the more recent past; his father was an avid recycler, long before it became common practice.\\n\u201cSustainability is a mindset and a lifestyle,\u201d agrees Dr Keith Powell, a seventh generation Black Mountains hill farmer. \u201cMy father always taught me that it's unviable not to farm sustainably; he saw that what you take out of the environment, you have to put back in again. It\u2019s a challenge we should relish rather than shy away from.\u201d\\nPrince Charles, who now runs his Aston Martin on bio-ethanol made from wine wastage and a cheese by-product, insists that it is a combined responsibility of all of us to work in harmony rather than conflict with nature.\\nThe first step, according to Lord Devon, is to trust that we can each, individually, make a difference \u2013 be it planting a million trees, which is what Powell has set out to do, or switching to an electric car.\\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been dead to the environment for too long, ordering countless packages online and living an unsustainable convenience life,\u201d says Lord Devon. \u201cBut now we\u2019ve all personally got to do better.\u201d\\nCharlie Courtenay, 19th Earl of Devon, runs Powderham Castle in Devon, which has been in his family since the 14th century.\\nThe Powderham Estate is a message in sustainability. Our deer park has been run in exactly the same way for 300 years and we\u2019ve recently discovered the ruins of a Roman farm in the park, suggesting that wheat, barley, oats, cattle and sheep have been farmed here in much the same way for 2,000 years. We\u2019ve never had any money to spend \u2013 our last injection of cash was in the 1840s \u2013 and we don\u2019t make profits; our revenue is reinvested in the fabric of the estate. There\u2019s always more to be done: dredging rivers; building lev\u00e9es; improving flood defences. We patch up for as long as we can and then we do a proper job. Over the past century we\u2019ve been as rattled as any privately held estate by revenue losses and rising taxes, but by being cautious and thinking sustainably, we\u2019re still here. If we were a greengrocers established in 1152, we\u2019d feel immensely proud of what we\u2019ve achieved but, somehow, because we are an aristocratic family, we feel embarrassed about it.\\nI was very aware growing up that modern farming was trashing the soil. We were paid to remove hedgerows and farmed fairly intensively, prompting big washouts. Over the past 15 to 20 years, we\u2019ve added organic matter back to the soil using minimum tillage, ploughing directly into the top soil using compost from the council and the biodiversity has improved. Jersey Tiger Moths, which my father only ever found in a small hedgerow on the far side of the estate, are now seen all over the south-west of England.\\nWhile I don\u2019t agree with Extinction Rebellion preventing ambulances from getting to hospitals, I understand that their message \u2013 that the voracious consumption of our environment cannot continue \u2013 urgently needs to get across. The Environment Bill is remarkable, but I\u2019m as concerned as they are that the Government won\u2019t deliver on their promises. Every smallholder, farmer and consumer needs to be nudged along to do a little bit better. We\u2019ve got a lot of work still to do.\\nJane Scotter has a 16-acre certified biodynamic farm in Herefordshire producing seasonal vegetables, fruit, herbs and flowers\\nI used to long for my mother to buy food in the lovely M&S packets that my friends had but she shopped at a market.\u00a0 She was brought up on a market garden and didn\u2019t mind about wonky vegetables; all she cared about was how things tasted when she cooked them. My father was in the army and we travelled all over Europe, tasting the market produce. I\u2019m glad she stuck to her guns; now I can see a vegetable and tell by its colour what it\u2019s going to taste like \u2013 it\u2019s in my soul. Since the Second World War science has been the answer \u2013 convenience cooking, miracle powders \u2013 and we\u2019ve lost the skills of preparing nutritious food simply and quickly. If you have chicken stock you can make so many things, but it\u2019s a faff; you\u2019ve got to spend time at the weekend boiling it up and freezing it into bags. For me this has always been a priority \u2013 I\u2019d rather enjoy delicious food and wine than a flashy car.\\nI take a peasant approach to growing. For fruit and vegetables to taste their best, you have to care for them properly using no chemicals. I use organic cow manure and follow the Maria Thun biodynamic calendar, which considers the unseen forces and influences on growing, sowing and cultivating. These include the alignment of the sun, moon and constellations, which relate to the four elements \u2013 earth, wind, fire and air \u2013 which are in turn related to the parts of the plant and also one\u2019s intentions.\\nIt\u2019s an ancient and instinctive way of growing, which was made popular again by Rudolf Steiner in 1924 when farmers were concerned about the impact of nitrogen on the quality of their soil. He told them to go back to the oldest form of organics and think holistically about their crop. You only have to look at the wine trade, where biodynamic is now considered the best, to see that it works.\\nPost-Covid I get the impression that people are having more time for growing and cooking again. They\u2019re realising that the lettuce they grow themselves is so delicious they can\u2019t go back to buying them in a shop. People are also understanding that it\u2019s best not to eat out of season. You can\u2019t avoid it completely \u2013 I would struggle to live without lemons \u2013 but we can for the most part stick to seasonal produce, which in Britain right now is brassicas, which like cool weather and can stand a lot of rain.\\nI wish more people would buy from farmers\u2019 markets and be prepared to pay a bit more for their food and cut flowers. Larger farms will feel encouraged to grow organically if they are incentivised by the consumer. With diesel prices as they are, it\u2019s really difficult for producers like me; a cabbage in the supermarket costs \u00a31; I sell mine for \u00a32 and that\u2019s tight. With flowers, the margins are even tougher.\\nThere isn\u2019t a college teaching people to be a market gardener anymore, but I think it\u2019s going to come back. I\u2019m in talks to set up a growing academy and I have volunteers working here who have come from professional-type jobs and now want to start living off the land. The fact is, though, it\u2019s extremely hard work and it isn\u2019t financially rewarding in the way people are used to these days. You\u2019ve got to be out there in the sun, rain and snow. I see it as a life choice, though. I like doing things well and seeing my vegetables used by the chef Skye Gyngell in her London restaurant, Spring, is very inspiring. The reward is in the produce and its incredible taste.\\nDr Keith Powell, a seventh-generation Welsh hill farmer, vet and a founder of Stump Up For Trees\\nAs a child growing up in the Brecon Beacons, I watched my parents plant different species of tree on every corner of the farm to replace those they\u2019d cut down. They knew that what you take out of the land you have to put back and this resonated with me. At Cambridge I used to go around college switching off the lights, and I got into guerrilla planting, driving to Madrid in a Land Rover powered by chip fat, planting conkers all the way. Then I went to work in the middle of nowhere in Africa, where everyone lived sustainably and happily. When I came back to Britain and saw how miserable everyone looked in the supermarket, I wanted to be self-sufficient.\\nMy wife, Emily, and I bought 50 acres of land with a river and woodland for energy and enough flat land to grow food on. We don\u2019t weave our own shirts from nettles, but for the past 12 years we have lived off-grid with a biomass boiler made out of an old factory chimney, solar-powered electricity and a hydro-electric generator made out of an old washing machine motor. Our drinking water is pumped from a spring using a 100-year-old ram pump.\\nWe do everything on the cheap, weighing up the lifespan and the carbon footprint of everything we buy, but we live very comfortably. Our four boys, aged 14, 12, 11 and eight have become fantastic skip divers, always trying to work out what they can make from their finds. They\u2019re not deprived of gadgets, though: if they want to play on the Xbox, we run the generator for an hour in the evening and they have lots of Lego. We also have things we love: Emily buys running shoes; beer is my luxury.\\nWe have 50 cattle and I\u2019m in the process of taking over the family sheep farm, as my father has dementia. He always taught me that if you don\u2019t look after the land,\u00a0 you will end up with poorer and poorer crops every year. At 53, my combine harvester, Felicity, is a year younger than me; our belts are getting slack and our bearings are slow but after a couple of days of combining we have a few tonnes of heritage wheat, which we\u2019ll mill on the farm and sell as flour. We\u2019ve also started producing biochar, an operation invented by the Incas, taking organic matter such as wood, grass and leaves, and converting it into a long-term carbon compound, which is an excellent soil additive.\\nIt\u2019s trees, though, that are our biggest operation now. It\u2019s hard to overstate their benefits \u2013 they literally give life. Since co-founding Stump Up For Trees \u2013 an initiative to persuade farmers to plant a million trees in the Brecon Beacons \u2013 with my friend, the journalist and author Robert Penn, Emily and I have put down 147,000 trees and Utility Warehouse recently paid us \u00a31\u2009million to plant and care for 200,000 trees for 12 years. We\u2019ve all got to address climate change in whatever way we can and tree planting is ours. We\u2019re perpetually skint and Emily says we\u2019ve almost divorced 10 times \u2013 I make it more like 100 \u2013 but anyone who visits us always tells us that we\u2019re living the dream, which cheers me up.\\nAdam Hills started an architectural salvage business in the Nineties with his wife Maria Speake\\nMy\u00a0grandmother would bag up old soaps into a net to ensure there was no waste, and my mother, a journalist and ecologist, was friends with the environmentalist Jonathon Porritt. So the \u201cmake do and mend\u201d ethos runs in my family.\\nWhen I went to Glasgow to study architecture at the Mackintosh School, where I met my wife, Maria, I realised early on that I didn\u2019t want to be an architect. I was more fascinated by the majesty and dereliction chic of the city, the crumbling buildings filled with marble and mahogany. Inspired by our architectural history tutor, Gavin Stamp, Maria and I found ourselves on a committee for the Church of Scotland, which decided the fate of unwanted stained glass and pews from redundant churches. We didn\u2019t set out to start dealing them; we wanted to save them and had a friend with a barn where we could store them. Soon our fledgling company, Retrouvius, was being commissioned to salvage elements from Glasgow\u2019s housing developments and offices, too. Glasgow was too small a pond to absorb these items, so we started talking to larger dealers such as Lassco in London and Chaunceys in Bristol. For the first decade, working in salvage felt like swimming upstream.\u00a0 The conversation about sustainability wasn\u2019t strong and the market was small.\\nIn 1997, when my mother died, we moved to London, intending to take a sabbatical from reclamation, only to buy some old stables in Kensal Green and reestablish Retrouvius. We\u2019re still in the same premises today.\u00a0 Our biggest salvage operation to date has been saving the entire concourse of Heathrow Terminal 2 \u2013 236,805 sq ft of rare Hopton Wood fossil limestone. We also saved the original bespoke furniture from Swiss Cottage Library and several Victorian railway carriages.\u00a0 These days I tend to work with smaller items, such as tapestries, chandeliers and light switches. A lot of what we save seems mundane, but it\u2019s rewarding putting things back into use and preventing virgin material being used.\\nGradually our business has become a property company, too. Maria, who was House & Garden Interior Designer of The Year, and I have created shops, hotels and private homes (including our own) out of salvage, which I like to think have been influential in promoting a re-use aesthetic and expanding the market and desire for reclamation.\\nTim Scott Bolton, an artist, and his wife, Trish, live sustainably in a straw bale house on their farm in Wiltshire\\nBoth of us came from frugal families who liked to grow their own produce and cook from scratch \u2013 but renewable energy wasn\u2019t an option for them. We drifted into it 20 years ago, first with solar panels on the roof that heated our hot water, and generated electricity.\\nWe then put in a wood-chip boiler to heat our house, farmyard and art gallery, which, at \u00a360,000, was an expensive undertaking, but we get an annual Government payment of up to \u00a310,000, which rather crazily encourages us to use as much fuel as possible. It\u2019s a good feeling being sustainable in terms of energy, and we\u2019re pleased that it\u2019s become the trendy thing to do.\\nWe weren\u2019t exactly organic pioneers, but we could see that chemicals weren\u2019t good for the earth, so we turned the farm organic in the early Nineties. We have our own vegetables, fruit, eggs and naturally-reared pigs, sheep and cattle. Mob grazing seems to be the thing these days; moving animals very regularly to graze small areas intensively, allowing the wildflowers to seed elsewhere.\\nNow the farms surrounding us are organic too and it has made such a difference to the flora and fauna.\\nIt was our son, Julian, who led us into sustainable housing. He\u2019s a sustainable builder who is even more purist about the environment than we are, avoiding cement wherever possible and installing sedum roofs.\\nWe were his guinea pigs for his first earth and straw bale house. He built it on our farm 10 years ago and we moved in two years ago when we downsized from the main house. The floor is local mud, treated with linseed oil, which makes a hard, smooth surface. One wall is hemp and lime, and the others are bales plastered in lime mortar. They look wavy, like an old cottage, which we love. The house is warm in winter and cool in summer and it feels very breathable.\\nWe feel very lucky to look out of the windows on to such beautiful scenery and want to do everything we can to ensure future generations can enjoy Britain\u2019s beautiful countryside too.\\nMake sure the installer and system are accredited through the Microgeneration Certification Scheme (msicertified.com)\\nIdeally from three different installers, and don\u2019t compare them on cost alone. Check if they will be project managing and if the price includes the cost of the system and commissioning it\\nYou may need to get planning permission or a building warrant from your local planning authority. If your home is listed, you will almost certainly require consent from your local authority\\nMake sure your policy covers the changes to your home and make any adjustments you need\\nThere are many schemes offering support and incentives for installing renewables.

Yet on Sunday evenings, when trying to enjoy a Victorian period drama on television, my fascination can be something of a pain.\\nThe 19th century designer is best known for his elaborate floral wallpaper, which has since become a cheat for set designers, I find; an easy signal to remind viewers of the story\u2019s Victorian setting. But the reality is that Morris\u2019s wallpaper often pops up on screen in woefully inappropriate places, something fellow devotee Anna Mason, former curator and manager of London\u2019s William Morris Gallery, criticised this week.\\n\u201cIn his own day he wasn\u2019t in homes up and down the country,\u201d Mason said at the Cheltenham Literature Festival on Wednesday, bemoaning the tendency for TV producers to distort the reality of Victorian life by plastering up Morris\u2019s wallpaper wherever they can.\\n\u201cBecause his designs have never gone out of production, whenever people are setting a period drama in the Victorian period they plaster William Morris on the walls because it\u2019s easy \u2013 you can ring up and get something on the wall. Now it\u2019s the archetype of what a Victorian home looks like, whereas in his day, the market for his wallpapers was, at the beginning in particular, very niche.\u201d\\nI know what she means. I practically jumped out of my seat while watching the film The Phantom Thread (2017), in which Daniel Day-Lewis plays Reynolds Woodcock, an ultra-stylish fashion designer in 1950s London who dresses members of high society. The character is a symbol of the experimental haute-couture movement of the 1950s and 1960s. And yet, for some bizarre reason, he patterns his dining room with Morris\u2019s floral wallpaper. By the post-war years, someone like Woodcock would have looked down on Morris\u2019s wallpaper as rather lazy and mass-produced.\\nIt points to something wider about Morris: how, 125 years after his death, the legendary designer is still somewhat misunderstood by those who profess to love him. Ask a person on the street for their views on Morris, and they\u2019ll almost certainly mention the word \u201cwallpaper\u201d. It\u2019s understandable; those detailed designs have become easily the most far-reaching aspect of his artistic legacy.\\nBut at the beginning of his career Morris was known more as a poet than a designer. He enjoyed a privileged, middle-class childhood in Essex, with a City broker father. After graduating with a degree in Classics from Exeter College, Oxford, he moved to Bloomsbury, which was at that point at the heart of Britain\u2019s intellectual life. His poems from that era include interminable epics, told in blank verse and rhyming couplets, retelling the tales of Troy.\\nBut it was in wall designs that Morris found his commercial success. Despite their ubiquity in Victorian TV dramas, Morris\u2019s wallpapers were in fact a little more niche; a status symbol of the avant-garde elite. His typical client was an aristocrat whose wife was interested in experimental interior design; or an upwardly-mobile professional looking to advertise not only their wealth, but also their refined cultural taste. When James Beale, a successful London solicitor, paid \u00a318,000 in the 1890s to build Standen, his country manor in West Sussex, he furnished it with Morris\u2019s fabrics and wallpapers. (The house was sold to the National Trust in 1972, allowing members of the public to enjoy Morris\u2019s intricate designs.)\\nHis wallpapers returned to fashion in the 1980s, this time with a more suburban feel. Some modern designers have perhaps gone slightly overboard, decorating entire rooms with Morris\u2019s elaborate, jungle-like design, when he only ever intended it to be a light, sparing touch. If he were alive today, I\u2019m not sure what he\u2019d think of the living room chair owned by Giles and Mary, stars of Channel 4\u2019s Gogglebox; it has become a subject of intense debate on social media.\\nLeast understood of all is Morris\u2019s politics. He\u2019s become a beloved figure among the British establishment \u2013 surprising, perhaps, given his firmly anarchist ideological leanings, which he discovered in middle age. His 1890 novel, News From Nowhere, depicts a utopian England transformed by an imagined 1952 Communist revolution, where men, women and children live in equality, and there is no private property \u2013 or money.\\nTony Blair once described Morris as his hero \u2013 again, surprising, given Morris\u2019s staunch opposition to parliamentary democracy. In his novel, he imagined the Palace of Westminster as a dung-house, filled with manure. If Morris were alive today, he\u2019d be leading Extinction Rebellion.\\nHis radical politics echoed through his personal life. When Morris\u2019s wife, Jane, admitted she was in love with one of his colleagues \u2013 pre-Raphaelite poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti \u2013 Morris allowed the pair to form a relationship. For a while, she spent the summers with Rossetti at Kelmscott, Oxfordshire, and the winters with Morris in London, loving them both \u2013 though the arrangement didn\u2019t last. He made a point of raising his two daughters, Jenny and May, in broadly the same way he would raise boys.\\nIt\u2019s just one of the fascinating details that makes it so delightful to study Morris \u2013 the man whose wallpaper adorns so many of our walls, but who so few of us truly understand.\\nAs told to Luke Mintz\\nWilliam Morris & Red House by Jan Marsh is available from Telegraph Books for \u00a325.

The Beverley Geronimo - which blocked the main entrance to the site for around eight hours.\\nThe environmental group claimed to have \"shut down\" the plant, but ExxonMobil - the plant's operator - told The Telegraph it had \"continued to operate safely and did not experiencing any impact on production\".\\nTwo British Olympians stood side-by-side with the Extinction Rebellion protesters.\\nSailor Laura Baldwin represented Team GB in the 2004 Athens Olympics before going on to coach in the 2012 London and 2016 Rio Games.\\nMs Baldwin said: \"I am a deeply protective mother, moved to take direct action in a desperate bid to force this suicidal system to change in time to limit the climate crisis worsening and slipping past the point of no return.\\n\"Watching the news this summer was horrifying and heartbreaking, witnessing catastrophic climate impacts killing people on every continent of the globe.\"\\nSlalom canoeist Etienne Stott, 42, was an Olympic gold medallist at London 2012.\\nHe was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to canoeing.\\nMr Stott added: \"I think it\u2019s totally wrong that oil companies continue to put their profits ahead of everyone\u2019s right to a future on a living planet.\\n\"We need our government to rein in these rogue companies as a matter of urgency and show to the world ahead of COP26 that the UK is prepared to take a genuine leadership position.\"\\nThe environmental\u00a0group - responsible for shutting down roads and bridges in London last year - said that ahead of COP26 it was \"demanding that the UK Government listens to the people and stops all fossil fuel investments now\".\\nA spokesman said that campaigners \"condemned the massive expansion of diesel production facilities at Fawley\", adding: \"ExxonMobil has known the devastating effects of fossil fuel production on the environment for over 40 years, but instead of acting responsibly on that knowledge, they've spent tens of millions funding climate denial and misinformation and obstructing a transition to cleaner energy sources.\"\\nAn ExxonMobil spokesman said: \"ExxonMobil believes that climate change risks warrant action and it\u2019s going to take all of us \u2014 business, governments and consumers \u2014 to make meaningful progress.\\n\"Our focus includes reducing our emissions, helping consumers reduce their emissions, and\u00a0 developing lower-emission energy solutions, including energy efficiency initiatives, biofuels, flare reduction and carbon capture and storage (CCS).\\n\"At Fawley, we are also directly helping motorists and farmers to reduce their emissions through the manufacturing of lower carbon fuels, and we are also producing the lubricants and chemicals that support lower emissions by use across a range of applications such as wind turbines and electric vehicles.\\n\"Furthermore, our chemicals play a vital role in our daily lives from medical equipment, to clothing, cleaning materials and healthcare products.\\n\"We respect the right to peaceful protest, but our priority is the safety of our people, our neighbours and our operations and we are working with Hampshire Police to ensure this is maintained.\\n\"ExxonMobil Fawley continues to operate safely and is not experiencing any impact on production.\\n\"We apologise to anyone from the local community or beyond experiencing any inconvenience resulting from the actions at Fawley today of this group.\"\\nA Hampshire Police spokesman said: \"Officers attended Fawley Refinery after reports of a protest, which were received just before 7am today.\\n\"Everyone has the right to free speech and protest.
