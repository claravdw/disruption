And its influence is enormous", "text": "It was inevitable. As Bristol became the focus of the most high-profile case involving criminal damage in many years \u2013 the de-erection, defacement and drowning of the statue of the philanthropic 17th century slave trader Edward Colston \u2013 Banksy decided to stick his oar in.\\nThe anonymous street artist, who is believed to come from the city, created a limited-edition run of T-shirts commemorating the empty plinth in support of the \u201cColston Four\u201d \u2013 the small group of defendants who refused to accept a police caution for their part in the toppling of Colston during a Black Lives Matter protest on June 7 2020. The artist launched it with an Instagram post that suggested the four use the money raised to \u201cgo for a pint\u201d.\\nFor Banksy, whose decision to keep his identity a secret has long protected the artist from charges of vandalism and criminal damage \u2013 at least during the 1990s and early 2000s, when having one of his graffiti works appear on your building did not equate to winning the lottery \u2013 this close-to-home intervention has a sort of perfect symmetry. The T-shirts, sold at five independent shops in Bristol, attracted queues of thousands of people of all ages, not only revealing the depth of feeling in the city about the case (and the attraction of owning a Banksy) but also raising awareness and perhaps even swaying the jury, who returned a majority verdict of not guilty earlier this week.\\nOf course, there will be those who doubt that such a light-hearted gesture of support could have influenced opinion on what was already an emotive issue in the city. Yet it\u2019s worth noting that, like it or not, right now, Banksy is Britain\u2019s most globally famous artist, bigger than Hirst, bigger than Turner, bigger than Hockney. Pooh-poohed by the art establishment and about as likely to get a Turner Prize nomination as he is to appear on Celebrity Bake-Off, Banksy nevertheless enjoys a popularity that goes far beyond the art world. No one knows for sure who he is, but everyone knows his name.\\nIn contrast with well-known British artists such as Anish Kapoor, who has outspoken views on everything from Brexit to government interference in our cultural institutions, almost all of Banksy\u2019s works are political \u2013 on some level. I would argue that this simple fact, laid next to his unassailable visibility, makes him de facto Britain\u2019s most important political artist. At the 2019 Venice Biennale, for instance, Swiss artist Christoph B\u00fcchel installed Barca Nostra (Our Boat), the giant, rusting hulk of a barge that sank in the Mediterranean with more than a thousand north African migrants on board. Banksy sprayed a small mural of a migrant girl wearing a lifejacket and holding a neon pink flare beside a canal, and instantly gained wider recognition.\\nBanksy has the platform (and in cases like his sneezing Covid rats spray-stencilled inside a London tube carriage, he has the train, too) but what exactly are his politics? At first glance, they look like a rag-bag of right-on \u201canti\u201d opinions: anti-right, anti-capitalism, anti-war, anti-Brexit. Choose an issue, any issue, and you can pretty much guess what Banksy\u2019s take on it will be. There\u2019s the 2019 mural celebrating the Extinction Rebellion protest in Marble Arch, for instance \u2013 \u201cFrom this moment despair ends and tactics begin\u201d \u2013 which is believed to be a Banksy.\\nOr the image of children giving allegiance to a Tesco-bag flag (anti-consumerism) that appeared on a wall in north London in 2008. In the 2017 general election, Banksy offered voters in six Bristol constituencies a limited-edition free print if they voted against the Tories and sent him a photo of their ballot paper to prove it. He was forced to withdraw the offer by the Electoral Commission, who warned that it could invalidate the results in those areas, but you get the gist.\\nSome scoff that Banksy\u2019s work is too simplistic and superficial to have any real political impact: his 2009 painting Devolved Parliament, for example, depicting the benches of the House of Commons colonised by chimpanzees, which sold for \u00a39.9m in 2019. Yet Dominic Cummings\u2019s understanding of the power of three-word slogans (perhaps learned from Soviet Russia), such as \u201cTake back control\u201d and \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d, and their performative part in real-world campaigns show that \u201csimple\u201d can be applied to politics with dramatic effects.\\nBanksy always intends to influence and effect change, and he\u2019s at his best when he\u2019s using humour to do it. The opening sequence he created for The Simpsons in 2010, which showed a hell-like Asian sweatshop making Simpsons merchandise was accompanied by the makers\u2019 forced laughter that, of course, it bore no relation to reality. You don\u2019t have to agree with Banksy to admire his chutzpah.\\nAnd increasingly, his financial clout has a power of its own. Earlier this year, a mural that had appeared on the wall of Southampton General Hospital in 2020, of a boy playing with a superhero doll in the shape of an NHS nurse, set an auction record for a Banksy work of \u00a314.4m. The money raised at the Christie\u2019s sale, plus a portion of the house\u2019s premium, was donated to an NHS charity. That\u2019s an awful lot of sponsored head shaves, for a start.", "image": [["Banksy's politics have always been integral to his art", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/art/2022/01/06/TELEMMGLPICT000282116776_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?imwidth=680"]], "author": null, "date": "2022-01-06"}, "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/body-intimate-thoughts-violated-police-political-ideas/": {"title": "\u2018My body and my most intimate thoughts were violated by the police because of my political ideas\u2019", "subtitle": "My story runs deeper than a personal betrayal \u2013 it reveals something dark and disturbing about the kind of society in which we live", "text": "This week I won \u00a3230,000 in damages from the Met Police in a landmark ruling that found they had breached my human rights. I was one of at least 36 women who were deceived into a relationship by an undercover cop who was sent to spy on me. The Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) found that operation violated my rights to privacy, freedom to expression and freedom from degrading treatment\\nOver the past decade, coverage has, understandably, focused on the sexual relationship I had with Mark Kennedy, the shocking details that emerged about institutional misogyny, the widespread practice of undercover officers deceiving women into sexual relationships in the course of their operations, and how far up the chain of command knowledge of those relationships went. You can listen to the stories of other women duped into relationships like mine \u2013 including other women deceived by Mark \u2013 on the first series of The Telegraph\u2019s podcast, Bed of Lies, using the audio player below.\\nIt is worth noting though, that the compensation I received \u2013 which includes my legal costs \u2013 was not for the abusive relationship Mark Kennedy had with me. The police admitted years ago that his actions were wrong, made a public apology and settled my civil claim in 2017. The ongoing battle, that has only now been resolved, was over systemic failings, and the implications of the IPT\u2019s ruling go far beyond the relationship I had with Mark.\\nThe Tribunal examined the overall lawfulness of Mark\u2019s operation and the actions of five other undercover officers who spied on me over a period of 12 years from 1998 to 2010. They found that my rights to freedom of expression and freedom of association and my right to private and family life were violated. They found that the authorisation process was \u201cfatally flawed\u201d and that the targeting of me and the political movements I was involved in was \u201cdisproportionate\u201d to any need for intelligence on the protest movement. The operations were \u201cunlawful\u201d and \u201cunnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.\\nIt became disturbingly clear over the course of my claim that, despite paying lip service to prosecuting crime, what the police were interested in was ideology. They viewed anyone with left-leaning ideas to be a \u201clike-minded individual\u201d and our privacy and political rights became fair game. It is impossible to describe the impact of discovering that my family, my home, my body and my most intimate thoughts were violated by the police because of my political ideas.\\nThe IPT ruling is long and detailed and it carefully considers the decision to deploy undercover officers into the Sumac Centre, the social centre in Nottingham where I first met Mark. They found that: \u201cThe Sumac Centre was not a criminal organisation. It was merely a place where various groups congregated\u2026 exercising rights enshrined in the ECHR.\u201d Yet the police kept undercover officers deployed in and around the Sumac Centre for around 11 years.\\nThe police accepted that the \u201cintelligence case\u201d which was used to make me a target was fabricated. I served a purpose and the unit clearly felt that was best left out of the official paperwork, even at the time.\\nThe IPT concluded that: \u201cIt is clear from the evidence that, during the Claimant\u2019s relationship with MK, he directly influenced not only her political opinions but also her movements.\u201d They detail how he influenced my decision to protest in Dublin in 2004; dissuaded me from travelling to support the pro-democracy movement in Myanmar; lent me money to ensure I attended an event in Hamburg; and used his position to influence my political decisions, depriving me of my political agency. The Tribunal\u2019s findings include how detailed information about my political activities \u201cwas gathered, recorded, stored and transmitted in contact logs, pocket notebooks and intelligence reports\u201d. I was specifically named in the RIPA authorisations and my political and protest activities were tracked for more than a decade.\\nThat is, of course, deeply upsetting for me. In many ways it runs deeper than Mark\u2019s personal betrayal because it is a collective betrayal that reveals something dark and disturbing about the kind of society in which we live. Growing up in Cold War Britain, I believed this kind of Stasi policing was the hallmark of totalitarian communism. It was not what \u201cwe\u201d did. That is important, because this kind of political interference was not confined to me. Thousands, maybe tens of thousands of people, were spied on by Mark\u2019s unit, the National Public Order Intelligence Unit, or its predecessor, the Special Demonstration Squad, known to have passed intelligence on people\u2019s trade union activity to an illegal employers blacklist. The Undercover Policing Inquiry has heard that more than 1000 political organisations were targeted, as well as serving politicians and members of the House of Lords. The ideological bias is starkly evident in the fact that, as far as we know, only three of the groups targeted and none of the MPs were on the Right.\\nIt took a decade of gruelling legal battles for me to get my claim heard by the courts. They stole my 30s and I will never get those years back.\\nMany others are still fighting for answers and justice. On Friday 28 Jan, my friend Jason Kirkpatrick finally got his claim heard by a German Court, more than 15 years after Mark Kennedy was deployed there. The court is yet to rule. Meanwhile, most of the 200 core participants in the public inquiry into undercover policing have yet to receive any disclosure about spying operations against them going back more than 50 years \u2013 and the inquiry has just announced further delays. The reasons given for why it has been so hard for any of us to get truth and accountability for these abuses is to protect ongoing policing operations. This is not all in the past. We know from more recent revelations that social movements such as Extinction Rebellion and School Strike for Climate, or Black Lives Matter continue to be targeted by counter terror policing, and secretive political policing operations that are ongoing today.\\nIn that context, the National Police Chief\u2019s Council (NPCC) and the Metropolitan Police made a statement this week in response to the IPT ruling. They appear to acknowledge that only \u201cpart of the claim related to a sexual relationship\u201d, however they quickly steer the conversation back to their preferred narrative of the rogue officer Mark Kennedy.\\n\u201cThe sexual relationship was wrong,\u201d they say, while making vague assertions that \u201cenormous change\u201d has been made.\u00a0 However, I am most struck by what they do not say. There is no mention of freedom of expression, freedom of association or secret policing operations that interfere with our fundamental political rights. It is as though they hope that they can distract the public from those findings altogether by talking about sex. For the most part, the media has been happy to oblige.\\n\u201cThis is not just a case about a renegade police officer who took advantage of his undercover deployment to indulge his sexual proclivities,\u201d said the IPT. \u201cThe undercover operation could not be justified as necessary in a democratic society.\u201d\\nIt added, there were \u201cdisturbing and lamentable failings at the most fundamental levels\u201d.\\nPut simply, the police have been manipulating political dissent and undermining democracy for decades \u2013 and we have no reason to believe that it has stopped. Greater powers are being given to the police by the CHIS Act and the Police Crime and Sentencing Bill. Meanwhile, with findings of institutional corruption and events such as \u201cPartygate\u201d raising serious questions about the Metropolitan police\u2019s role in politics, the things we discovered during my IPT hearings contain important lessons that we ignore at our peril.\\nListen to The Telegraph's award-winning podcast, Bed of Lies, to hear the stories of other British women who found out their boyfriends were police spies on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or your podcast app.", "image": [["Kate Wilson, 41, began a relationship with Mark Stone shortly after first meeting him in 2003 and had a \u201cwhirlwind romance\u201d for more than a year before they split amicably in 2005", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/women/2022/01/28/TELEMMGLPICT000283804409_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqD3d2dmOlWYuQkR76XZjLQKOylOV7i1cNNz18XOj47vE.jpeg?imwidth=680"], ["PC Mark Kennedy aka Mark Stone duped Kate into a relationship while he was undercover", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/women/2022/01/28/TELEMMGLPICT000006446213_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqeKwbNrcenAy0Vr1pEXoBGkxkScGbgbK6_2j-FmpWeo8.jpeg?imwidth=350"]], "author": ["Kate Wilson", "Ella Nunn", "David Christopher Kaufman ", "Emily Peck", "Claire Allfree", "Laura Donnelly", "Simon Johnson"], "date": "2022-01-29"}, "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/01/05/blm-activists-dumped-edward-colston-statue-bristol-harbour-cleared/": {"title": "\u2018Colston four\u2019 walk free as jury finds no crime was committed in toppling statue", "subtitle": "Black Lives Matter activists argue successfully that they \u2018prevented\u2019 a hate crime by pulling down the bronze monument in Bristol", "text": "Four Black Lives Matter activists who openly admitted toppling the statue of Edward Colston walked free from court after a jury agreed that they had committed no crime.\\nThe three men and one woman - dubbed the Colston Four - were acquitted of criminal damage after opting for a jury trial and arguing that pulling down the bronze statue in Bristol and rolling it into a harbour was justified.\\nThe verdict led to concerns that other protesters will be encouraged to take the law into their own hands.\\nCabinet ministers expressed disquiet at the verdict, which follows the case of six Extinction Rebellion demonstrators being cleared of similar charges after allegedly attacking Shell\u2019s London headquarters last year.\\nAmid warnings that the verdict amounted to a \u201cgreen light for mobs\u201d, MPs urged ministers to consider whether further changes to the law were needed.\\nHowever, lawyers and academics argued that the case was a \"quintessential\" example of the British jury system.\\nRhian Graham, 30, Milo Ponsford, 26, and Sage Willoughby, 22, were charged with criminal damage after being caught on CCTV passing the ropes around the statue that were used to pull the statue down on June 7 2020.\\nThe fourth defendant, Jake Skuse, 33, was accused of orchestrating the plan to throw it in the harbour.\\nThe statue of Colston, a 17th-century slave merchant, was pulled down during a Black Lives Matter protest attended by a huge crowd.

There were cheers from a public gallery packed with their supporters at Bristol Crown Court.\\nDuring the trial, David Olusoga, the historian, appeared as a witness for the defence.

Her well-being remains of paramount concern to me.\\n\u201cThere is a long history of protest, including civil disobedience, within the Church.

\u201cpriceless\u201d and \u201cpure escapism\u201d. Others took to Twitter to call it \u201cout of touch\u201d, \u201dtone deaf\u201d and \u201ceverything that\u2019s wrong with this country\u201d. ITV\u2019s stately docuseries Keeping Up With The Aristocrats launched last night to, let\u2019s say, a mixed reception.\\nFollowing four of Britain\u2019s most prominent dynasties - the Mountbattens, Romanoffs, Sitwells and Fitzalan-Howards - it was an awfully entertaining hour of crumbling residences, robust swearing and red trousers.\\nThere\u2019s a long and (literally) noble tradition of factual TV following asset-rich, cash-poor aristocrats. They might have blue blood and good breeding but they\u2019re also frequently broke and prepared to play ball for camera crews. It\u2019s pleasingly voyeuristic. It\u2019s televisual class tourism. And crucially, it\u2019s often very funny.\\nHands up if you remember Home From The Hill, director Molly Dineen\u2019s award-winning 1987 documentary about the larger-than-life army officer Hilary Hook? The brilliantly bittersweet film showed how retired Lieutenant-Colonel had been evicted from his extravagant colonial home in Kenya and was struggling to adjust to modern life back in Blighty. Cue him cursing at tin openers and reminiscing about jolly japes from his public schooldays (\u201cAre soles in season, sir?\u201d).\\nFrom the reclusive oddballs of Grey Gardens to the preening King\u2019s Road socialites of Made In Chelsea, viewers have long held a fascination for seeing how the other half really live. The likes of Lord Brocket and Lady Colin Campbell found unlikely fame in the I\u2019m A Celebrity jungle. We\u2019ve since had Posh Pawn, Inside Tatler, and those endless schedule-fillers about decorating stately homes for Christmas. Yah, yah, absolutely. The upper classes have become a plummy primetime fixture.\\nTV\u2019s current obsession with toff docs can surely be traced back to the \u201cfilthy Fulfords\u201d - an eccentric clan of West Country aristos who became cult anti-heroes during the Noughties. Their outrageous antics caused a storm in a bone china teacup and saw them dubbed \u201cThe Osbournes in tweeds\u201d.\\nAiring in August 2004 on Channel 4\u2019s Cutting Edge strand, The F______ Fulfords followed Francis and Kishanda Fulford as they hatched hare-brained schemes to fund repairs to their dilapidated Tudor pile in rural Devon. Their bloodline could be traced back to Richard the Lionheart, who\u2019d gifted Francis\u2019 forebears their estate in 1199 for a \u201cjob well done\u201d during the Crusades.\\nThe fly-on-the-wall film exposed the family as rude, crude, uncouth and unhygienic. Their faces were ruddy, their teeth snaggly. Bat droppings pebble-dashed the soft furnishings. Their four unruly children had a penchant for fisticuffs, smashing china, slinging mud at each other and hurling cricket balls across the Great Hall. Muddy labradors Bertie and Tim jumped on the kitchen table to lick their owners\u2019 dinner plates clean.\\n\u201cThe ways I train my dogs and bring up my children are exactly the same,\u201d said Francis. His school nicknames, he explained matter-of-factly, had been \u201cFull-of-food\u201d, \u201cFatty\u201d and simply \u201cF___er\u201d.\\nWe heard how the 800-year-old, 3,000-acre Great Fulford estate cost \u00a330,000 a year to run, while the creaking 48-room manor house needed repairs worth \u00a31m. Wallpaper was peeling. Windows were broken. Roofs leaked, debts mounted and the family \u201clived in genteel poverty\u201d.\\nFrancis\u2019 money-spinning ideas included borrowing a \u00a399 metal detector in the hope of unearthing buried treasure (he found the princely sum of 6p), conjuring up a ghost to attract American tourists and searching the grounds for telephone cables so he could invoice BT for using his land. Long-suffering, Tanzania-born wife Kishanda preferred sneaking off for a secret flutter on the gee-gees. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we rich?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt really annoys me.\u201d\\nIt was chaotic, compelling and bracingly entertaining. They drank like fish, smoked like chimneys and swore like sailors. When Francis claimed his first word as a baby had been \u201cbugger\u201d, it was unclear whether he was joking.\\nTheir loudly expressed views were refreshingly un-PC. Francis railed against the Germans and French, and sneered at Americans for having \u201ca fat gene\u201d. He expressed pride that his children weren\u2019t \u201ca bunch of poofs\u201d because \u201cyou can\u2019t breed from them\u201d.\\nIn a fit of rage, Kishanda threw the children\u2019s TV into the lake. Francis ranted about \u201cthose bastards\u201d and \u201cw______\u201d at English Heritage. During the 45-minute programme, he uttered 38 swearwords. Another 15 came from his children. This was car-crash TV, if the car was a clapped-out Jag stuck in a ditch.\\nIt attracted 3.5m viewers and earned a Bafta nomination. For a generation of viewers, it was their first introduction to just how dishevelled and down-on-their-luck\u00a0posh people can be. When once they ruled over us, 21st century landed gentry are often custodians of draughty, decaying ruins are ruinously costly to maintain. They must diversify to pay their way but are often ill-equipped to do so.\\nThe much-discussed documentary brought the Fulfords a strange kind of fame. Patriarch Francis popped up on other programmes including How Clean Is Your House, Country House Rescue, Salvage Hunters, Help! My House Is Haunted and the poetically titled Why Britain\u2019s F_____. It all made him a little less skint, at least.\\nHe tried to enter local politics, standing for a seat on Teignbridge District Council as a Conservative candidate but polled just 370 votes, despite the area being a Tory stronghold. Fulford promptly joined UKIP instead.\\nWith the appetite for aristocratic TV reawakened by Downton Abbey, the Fulfords returned to our screens in 2014. The BBC Three series Life Is Toff focused on the next generation. A decade after they\u2019d been terrors in short trousers, the six-parter followed siblings Arthur, Humphrey, Edmund and Matilda - now aged 17 to 21 - as they prepared to leave education and enter the real world.\\nWell, sort of. As heir-to-the-estate Arthur said: \u201c\u2018We\u2019ve been here longer than the f______ monarchy. If anyone tries to judge me for being in this amazing position, frankly they can f___ off.\u201d Perhaps unsurprisingly, he\u2019d been expelled\u00a0from \u00a330,000-a-year Sherborne school for bad behaviour.\\nGreat Fulford now relied on guided tours, wedding bookings, pheasant shoots and photoshoots for income. The Fulford Jnrs flogged antiques at a car boot sale but were so rubbish at it, they only made a few quid. Matilda got so stressed by the experience, she called an ambulance.\\nThey fired air rifles from windows and hit golf balls at grazing cows. Matilda roller-skated around the Great Hall, like Princess Diana in The Crown. A large Muscovy duck called Ben roamed the corridors, leaving a trail of droppings behind him.\\nIn 2016, Arthur was charged with drink-driving and resisting arrest after flipping his father's Ford Focus on a country lane. The 24-year-old insisted he wasn\u2019t over the limit after sinking five pints at a local pub. He lost his appeal and was slapped with a 12-month ban. Even his own lawyer said Arthur\u2019s evidence was \"all over the place\" and \"a bit of a pantomime\".\\nThe following year, he tried to extend his 15 minutes of fame by signing up for reality franchise Big Brother. Arthur entered the house hoping to \u201chave a really good time\u201d but duly got into rows about the benefits system and whether the earth is flat. He vandalised a mannequin while drunk on champagne, took a naked shower in front of his housemates, then quit after six days, branding them \u201cf_____g stupid\u201d. Talk about a\u00a0chip off the old block.\\nHis father Francis, now 69, remains as opinionated as ever. The latest entries on his blog defend Prince Andrew, call civil servant Sir Philip Rutnam \u201ca big girl\u2019s blouse\u201d for accusing Priti Patel of bullying, and slam Londoners as \u201cwet\u201d for \u201cputting up with the ridiculous Extinction Rebellion protesters\u201d when they should \u201csort these prima donna idiots out\u201d.\\nAh, Francis Fulford.
