In the grainy, black-and-white image, a woman \u2013 Crook\u2019s grandmother \u2013 sits in a chair facing the camera. Behind her lurks a white spectral vision of horror. It\u2019s really quite chilling. It\u2019s also fake.\\n\u201cMy grandfather was this shy, grumpy greengrocer,\u201d says Crook. \u201cIt turns out he had this hobby of trying to make fake ghost photos. We had no idea. I used to do it when I was younger, too.\u201d\\nIt feels appropriate that Crook has an unassuming ancestor with a hidden talent. You could easily imagine \u2013 if his face weren\u2019t so famous \u2013 Crook\u2019s north London neighbours being entirely unaware that the nice bloke next door, with his indie-rocker clothes and hobby shed, has won two Baftas, acted with Johnny Depp in Hollywood blockbusters and formed an integral part of the most influential English-language TV comedy of the past 20 years. He is also responsible \u2013 as writer, director and star \u2013 for the most delightful early-evening family viewing in years, the BBC\u2019s Worzel Gummidge reboot, which returns to our screens next week.\\nBefore meeting Crook, I was planning to ask him how much he identified with The Office\u2019s hapless nerd, Gareth Keenan (or if he was more like randy delivery driver Ferris from his 2004 comedy Sex Lives of the Potato Men). But it only takes a few minutes to realise that Crook is Worzel. Not the straw-stuffed, head-swapping, child-frightener inhabited by Jon Pertwee in the original 1970s series, but Crook\u2019s modern version \u2013 gentle, softly spoken and in love with the natural world.\\nWorzel\u2019s next adventure is called \u201cTwitchers\u201d, with the scarecrow vying with a bunch of birdwatchers for a glimpse of some choughs. Does Crook twitch? \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things my wife calls my \u2018imaginary hobbies\u2019,\u201d he says (Crook has been married since 2001 and the couple have two children).\\n\u201cI know a lot about birds and this year, for the first time, I\u2019ve kept a list of the species I\u2019ve spotted. I have enough knowledge and all the equipment, but I hardly ever go. It\u2019s the same with metal detecting.\u201d The latter, of course, was a hobby he picked up while making his Bafta-winning comedy Detectorists with co-star Toby Jones, about a pair of middle-aged metal detectors \u2013 sorry, metal detectorists \u2013 on the hunt for an elusive Saxon haul.\\nIs knowing the names of the birds and trees a dying art in this country? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d says Crook. \u201cI just know it\u2019s really important to me. If a bird flies across my path and I don\u2019t know what it is, I\u2019ll endeavour to find out. But I know for a lot of people, it\u2019s not important.\u201d Crook\u2019s Worzel Gummidge is a show set in a determinedly old-fashioned and rural world in which we barely see a smartphone or a television, but feel the changing of the seasons and the programme\u2019s obvious love for the English countryside. Does he see Worzel as a green activist?\\n\u201cI think there\u2019s an environmental message to the show,\u201d says Crook. \u201cIt would be odd not to include it, as it\u2019s such a current thing. But I don\u2019t want it to be preachy, it should be almost subliminal.\u201d\\nWould Worzel join Extinction Rebellion if he could, blocking roads and gluing himself to railings? \u201cI think he\u2019d be amazed and amused by the lengths they\u2019re going to, but Worzel is aware how urgent it all is. So, yeah, they\u2019d get the thumbs up from him.\u201d\\nOne hallmark of the 1970s Worzel is the legions of British adults who are still mildly scarred by their memories of the scarecrow. Crook wanted to ensure this generation of Gummidge fans could sleep at night, but when the first images of his version were released to the media one tabloid compared him to the Nightmare on Elm Street monster Freddie Kreuger.\\n\u201cPeople keep talking about folk-horror and I\u2019m not quite sure I understand what that is, but apparently there\u2019s an element of that in there,\u201d Crook says. \u201cBut it\u2019s a human built to look like a man standing in a field to scare away crows. There is something scary about that. But children seem to warm to him. He\u2019s a good friend and you soon find that out.\\nThe folk-horror element, perhaps, comes from the fact that more and more Britons find the countryside itself dark and foreboding, an otherworldly place (without wifi). While there is a clear thread of the bucolic running through Crook\u2019s work \u2013 as well as Worzel and Detectorists he famously starred in the original production of Jez Butterworth\u2019s hit play Jerusalem, and plays a druid in Butterworth\u2019s Sky drama Britannia \u2013 there is also a sense that nature is a powerful force beyond our control.\\n\u201cThere is something mysterious and unknown about it. I have this woodland in Essex and in the height of summer, when you walk in there, it\u2019s so oppressive. There\u2019s so much pollen and insects in the air and things that are making you itch and sneeze and you just think, \u2018I\u2019m not actually invited here, I\u2019m not really very welcome\u2019.\u201d\\nWhen we speak, Crook has yet to learn from Butterworth or director Ian Rickson how they will be restaging Jerusalem, which is being revived in the West End next year with most of the original cast from 2009, including Mark Rylance, who will reprise his role of Rooster Byron, a mystical drug dealer living in a caravan in a Wiltshire forest.\\nWhen Crook first starred in the play, he was in his mid-30s \u2013 now he\u2019s 50. Will that change how he approaches his performance? Crook recounts a time during the first rehearsal when the cast visited Pewsey in Wiltshire, where Jerusalem is based (though in the play it is called Flintock), and he met the inspiration for the character of Ginger. \u201cAnd he was my age, fiftysomething, just a couple of teeth left in his head but he thought he was a teenager.\u201d\\nIt will be instructive to see how the production deals with men like Ginger and, in particular Rylance\u2019s Rooster; older men who ply young girls with booze and drugs. Byron is not a man who fits in the MeToo era.\\nNor, while we\u2019re on the subject, does the un-PC David Brent. Crook hasn\u2019t watched an episode of The Office \u201cfor years\u201d, but his 18-year-old son Jude really likes it; his daughter, Scout, 14, hasn\u2019t watched it. But the show still stands up, 20 years on, says Crook. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t dated as much as I feared it would \u2013 but it\u2019s a document of the time.\u201d\\nIts creator, Ricky Gervais, has since gone on to blaze a trail in a style of comedy that seems to revel in the concept of free speech/causing offence (delete as appropriate). Crook\u2019s comedy, is the opposite. There is no cruelty, humiliation or embarrassment. \u201cBut that\u2019s not because I disapprove,\u201d he says. \u201cI adore The Office and I adore that kind of comedy. I think my work has definitely been a conscious decision to do something uncynical, but it\u2019s not a reaction against that sort of humour.\u201d\\nAs for Gervais, who now lives in Los Angeles and is a global superstar, Crook has not seen him since they were both on the set of Muppets Most Wanted in 2013. Crook\u2019s future is, he says, definitely not in Hollywood (\u201cAmerica doesn\u2019t seem like a very appealing place at the moment\u201d). He is happy to be working in British TV, and is more likely to be behind the camera than in front of it. After Jerusalem, he is not sure what comes next, but he is keen to write one more Detectorists special.\\nNo interview with Crook could be complete without an update on Winter George, the robin who has been visiting Crook in his garden for the past five years and who has been turned into a character in Worzel Gummidge. As it turns out, Crook hasn\u2019t seen him in a few months.\\n\u201cI\u2019m amazed he\u2019s been around for five years. He comes indoors, he comes into my shed and hangs out with me. In the first few pages of [the book] Worzel Gummidge [by Barbara Euphan Todd] it says he has a robin\u2019s nest inside his jacket, that\u2019s how I knew Worzel was a good fit for me. I\u2019m hoping Winter George will come back again. I\u2019m a bit lost without him.\u201d\\nWorzel Gummidge is on BBC One at 7.15pm on December 28 and 29", "image": [["Francesca Mills as Mangold and Mackenzie Crook as Worzel Gummidge in Twitchers, a new episode of Worzel Gummidge out on BBC One on Dec 28", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tv/2021/12/26/TELEMMGLPICT000279586383_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqUTB3vMrBgFH3wkEYGI_sPP4Xpit_DMGvdp2n7FDd82k.jpeg?imwidth=680"], ["Mackenzie Crook as Andy in Detectorists (2014)", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tv/2021/12/26/TELEMMGLPICT000036906703_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNJjoeBT78QIaYdkJdEY4CnGTJFJS74MYhNY6w3GNbO8.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["Clarty (Tim Plester) in Twitchers, a new episode of Worzel Gummidge out on BBC One on Dec 28", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tv/2021/12/26/TELEMMGLPICT000279587284_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqYXjog94lRMOHxImHynYRZf4Xpit_DMGvdp2n7FDd82k.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["Mould-breaking: The Office (2003), starring Lucy Davis, Ricky Gervais, Martin Freeman and Mackenzie Crook", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tv/2021/12/26/TELEMMGLPICT000000372648_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqqkb88qSgqUxWyAI78UoubE3oOXNROu1EFP51T6s2Qt8.jpeg?imwidth=350"]], "author": ["Chris Bennion"], "date": "2021-12-27"}}
