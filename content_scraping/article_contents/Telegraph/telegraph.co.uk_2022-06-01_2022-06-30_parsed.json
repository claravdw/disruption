Enough is enough.\\n\u201cThis is the last remaining tree and this council now - in this environmentally-aware world that we live in - describe this ancient tree as a \u2018nuisance\u2019 and want to fell it as a precaution.\\n\u201cIf you said that any tree, near any house, could potentially create damage, you\u2019re going to fell thousands of trees across the country.\u201d\\nNigel Simons, who has responsibility for the council\u2019s environmental policy, said earlier: \u201cWe will be going ahead with the felling and ask those at the scene to respect our decision \u2013 we especially ask that they do not put themselves in danger \u2013 and to think carefully before doing anything illegal.\u201d\\nHe added that it was a \u201cdifficult decision\u201d to fell the tree.\\n\u201cWe understand the point of view of some residents, it is a beautiful tree and we would not be doing this if we did not have to. All options to save the tree could have cost the council hundreds of thousands of pounds in repairs and legal fees.\\n\u201cThis would have meant we had no money to plant additional trees in our city or maintain our existing tree stock.\u201d", "image": [["Work starts to cut down the tree in Blind Lane in Peterborough", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/environment/2022/06/29/TELEMMGLPICT000301277209_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqA7N2CxnJWnYI3tCbVBgu9T0aesusvN1TE7a0ddd_esI.jpeg?imwidth=680"], ["The tree's roots are said to be causing structural damage to nearby houses", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/environment/2022/06/29/TELEMMGLPICT000301277212_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqzpnK1fqIf8AfXYjEGXVTomuT-RD8RsYMxMpJRtmVdl4.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["An activist sits in a hammock in the tree in Peterborough", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/environment/2022/06/29/TELEMMGLPICT000301243429_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["The council urges people to 'think carefully before doing anything illegal'", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/environment/2022/06/29/TELEMMGLPICT000301243502_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqyuLFFzXshuGqnr8zPdDWXhbQKbwj1ZsnNMhuR7O6ySI.jpeg?imwidth=350"]], "author": ["Telegraph Reporters"], "date": "2022-06-29"}}
