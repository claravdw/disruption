From celebrities proclaiming the need to be \u201cbrave\u201d about social media\u2019s latest political trend, to kids at school being encouraged to ditch classes \u201cfor the climate\u201d, engaging in online political protest is now as widely recommended as eating your five-a-day.\\nIn fact, we\u2019re so used to people \u201cspeaking up\u201d that it can be quite hard for a stunt or protest to break through. Politics, like contemporary art, is often crippled by a Duchamp-urinal effect, in which the gallivanting street-theatre of Extinction Rebellion or the throwing of buckets of blood at arms conventions has long felt a bit samey.\\nSuch was the case, this week, with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Met Gala dress, a beautiful Aurora James off-the-shoulder gown with \u201ctax the rich\u201d emblazoned on the back. All the usual people went wild; one Guardian writer penned a \u201cguide to getting noticed at parties\u201d with the advice: \u201cArrive AOC-style, in the blood-spattered garments of fighting class war.\u201d\\nBut while everyone from couture critics to (supposedly) serious political commentators fawned over AOC\u2019s \u201cbravery\u201d, the rest of us were wondering how edgy it really is to use photo opportunities at a fashion show to raise questions about taxation. This was no Miss-World-1970s-style flour-bombing; the Gala\u2019s co-chairs, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Billie Eilish, Amanda Gorman and Naomi Osaka, walked away coiffured and unscathed. AOC wore her dress, made a few Hollywood royals smirk, and took her seat for the rest of the fancy evening. She might as well have ruined her dress with something catchier, such as \u201cdeath to the middle classes\u201d.\\nAOC wasn\u2019t alone in taking a stand (in heels) that night. Plenty of other celebrities wore what Harper\u2019s Bazaar called \u201csocially conscious statements\u201d. The US congresswoman Carolyn Bosher Maloney paid tribute to the 2021 theme, \u201cAmerican Fashion\u201d, by arriving draped in women\u2019s-rights slogans. The message would have been more effective had Maloney not been celebrating women\u2019s freedom while mask-less and flanked by female staff trussed up with face coverings.\\nAnd supermodel Cara Delevingne kept it simple with a \u201cpeg the patriarchy\u201d bullet vest (though it\u2019s unclear whether she wanted to inflict pleasure or pain on said patriarchy). These displays are nothing new. From Kristen Stewart removing her Louboutins in a protest against \u201csexist dress codes\u201d at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival to the Time\u2019s Up pins at the Golden Globes (remember them?), political protest is the statement clutch-bag of the modern celebrity outfit.\\nThis is the problem with the aestheticisation of political protest \u2013 it becomes a means of preserving the status quo, rather than challenging it. Despite AOC\u2019s Instagram nod to Marshall McLuhan\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe medium is the message\u201d, the message that her dress and other awards-ceremony stunts send home is that politics happens in the seedy world of elites, a simulacrum watched on television by a less privileged populace \u2013 who are supposed to applaud.\\nIn America, the anti-democratic nature of modern activism was also set to be crudely exemplified in a new TV show (now hastily reworked), titled The Activist, in which cherry-picked \u201cactivists\u201d would battle for their chosen cause under the guidance of political leaders such as Usher and Priyanka Chopra Jonas. The winner? Whoever managed to amass the most likes, clicks and follows on social media to show the worthiness of their campaign; they would get to make a speech at the G20 Summit in Rome (presumably in a slogan-embellished couture gown). What we previously understood to be the key purpose of political protest \u2013 to convince fellow citizens of the need to change the world from below \u2013 was being ditched in favour of winning the patronage of those in power.\\nIt\u2019s unsurprising that most of today\u2019s champagne protests take place in the world of fashion and art, neither of which is famed for its ability to be populist. From Emma Thompson riding a pink Extinction Rebellion boat around London to Vivienne Westwood churning up David Cameron\u2019s driveway in a tank, climate-change activism has quietly and assuredly gained control of the arts. The World Wide Fund for Nature is leading a \u201cgo green\u201d day on November 5 as part of its Art For Your World project, involving most major UK museums and galleries. The Tate has said it is \u201cdetermined to inspire environmental change\u201d, while the artist Tracey Emin has warned critics that \u201canything that makes people aware of the damage we are doing to this planet, and what we can do to save it, is worthwhile\u201d.\\nWhatever you think about how we\u2019re going to combat climate change, and the effectiveness of artists hectoring the public, the homogeneity of institutions\u2019 obsession with the green agenda is a threat to the notion of artistic freedom. It\u2019s not quite clear what a \u201cgo green\u201d day, week or month would look like, but you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that only artists who create carbon-neutral work, and punters who offset their emissions, will one day be allowed to show in, and visit, the exhibitions.\\nPolitics and art have always intertwined, but, to use a much-loved phrase of political luvvies, the successful protests were always about punching up. When celebrity politicians, film stars, museum heads and gallery owners take a stand \u2013 usually a very pretty stand, like Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s 2014 Chanel show, involving placard-wielding top models such as Delevingne and Gisele B\u00fcndchen \u2013 it is often less about changing the world, with the masses willingly in tow, and more a cosy recognition that there\u2019s a \u201cright side\u201d that certain people are already on. Top-down expressions of \u201cradicalism\u201d rarely inspire political change. Taking a stand is easier on the red carpet than it is on the street.", "image": [["US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez attends the Met Gala in a dress ensloganed with \"Tax the Rich\"", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/art/2021/09/17/TELEMMGLPICT000271205841_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqW5LAbqXSQw_G1yEaLnMlB4yt3BU7yimAYJ8YD28sfCE.jpeg?imwidth=680"], ["Pain or pleasure?

It\u2019s a measure of the seriousness of his leaving that the story spoke about GB News mainly in the past tense. Can GB News survive his departure? And what does it mean for the dream of conservative news TV in Britain?\\nThe station\u2019s comings and goings have been heavily reported \u2013 Neil fell out with station founder and chief executive Angelos Frangopoulos over the channel\u2019s direction. GB News\u2019 director of news and programming John McAndrew left in July, followed by production staff, including Neil\u2019s producer Jamie McConkey. Frangopoulos, despairing at low ratings, is steering GB News into the Fox News wind. Nigel Farage briefly boosted numbers, but ratings fell back, now bouncing along in the tens of thousands. The company launched with \u00a360 million in the bank from US, Dubai and UK-based backers whose pockets are deep \u2013 but just how deep do they go?\\nThe Beast story was wrong in one key detail: GB News didn\u2019t set out to be a Fox News wannabe \u2013 at least as far as Andrew Neil was concerned. In his opening statement delivered to camera he laid out the need for a right of centre news station clear and precisely: \u201cGB News will not be another echo chamber for the metropolitan mindset that already dominates so much of the media,\u201d he said gravely, introducing a manifesto that would \u201cempower those who feel their stories, their opinions, their concerns have been ignored or diminished.\u201d\\n\u201cWe will not lecture\u2026 and nobody will be allowed to hector,\u201d he went on. \u201cIf you want fake news, lies, disinformation, distortion of the facts, conspiracy theories, then GB News is not for you\u2026\u201d\\nThis theory of a Right-of-Centre, intelligent, news-based TV station headed up by Andrew Neil was so inspiring to the Right and so alarming to the Left that the first couple of weeks saw guests of both stripes bring their A game. This, after all, is a Right-of-Centre country with a long tradition of informed dissent. Election debates often outperform soap operas as elections loom. We love seeing elites challenged.\\nFox News, on the other hand, is currently built on anti-vax conspiracy and \u2013 unlike Neil\u2019s demolition of Rishi Sunak in a superbly conducted first week interview \u2013 is a party line station, not a true contrarian. So, as GB News lurched through zero ratings, woeful tech, executives jumping ship, phone lines failing, wildly vacillating public statements over whether it was OK for Guto Harri to take the knee (with an eye-watering lack of irony as a station launched to support free and open debate in the face of cancel culture literally cancelled its own presenter), it seemed depressingly unable to represent either the tradition of British contrarians like George Orwell and Christopher Hitchens, nor match Fox News\u2019 impassioned political focus.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate for the Right-of-Centre world that GB News travails hog the headlines as if Right-wing news is failing,\u201d says David Elstein, former chief executive of Channel 5, who points to a challenging market as one of the fledgling channel\u2019s many difficulties.\\n\u201cI warned [Frangopoulos] the field was very crowded. The bulk of the small audience available is soaked up by the state-funded BBC and heavily subsidised Sky News. Even if the BBC is regarded as not always unbiased, Sky News comes out well in surveys on trust. Then calling it a news channel where there\u2019s very little news doesn\u2019t help... It\u2019s basically people shouting. Whether that\u2019s from the Left or Right, Owen Jones or Nigel Farage, that is not sustainable.\u201d\\nGB News is rapidly reshaping its output, confirming Colin Brazier as Andrew Neil\u2019s replacement and removing his \u2018woke watch\u2019 slot. Tom Harrington from Enders Analysis believes it will be forced to move further Right to attract an audience, but this may prove to be unpopular among the staff that do remain.\\nSources say there is a clear division in the newsroom between those who favour the shock jock journalism represented by Dan Wootton and some of the channel\u2019s more recent hires, and others who are alarmed by attempts to move away from more sober discussion. The departure of McAndrew, a well-respected news executive, also dismayed some of the senior hires.\\n\u201cAndrew Neil may have been the face of the channel but a lot of the senior guys in front of the camera and behind it were persuaded to join because they were reassured by John\u2019s presence that this wasn\u2019t going to be a Mickey Mouse outfit,\u201d said a source.\\nWhile some insiders are adamant the channel is not reliant on Neil\u2019s presence \u2013 let\u2019s not forget that his departure from both Sky TV and Fox TV in their early days did not bring about a demise \u2013 there is some disquiet about Brazier\u2019s positioning as the station\u2019s star turn.\\nDespite what the team might think, Frangopoulos seems to be driven by his experience running Sky News in Australia, which Elstein describes as \u201cbland in the day and noisy in the evening with former politicians turning up to have an opinionated bash at people and events.\u201d\\nHe says: \u201cIt\u2019s very Australian, very outspoken and works well over there. The UK is different. Fox News was available here for years until it surrendered its licence in 2017 and no-one watched it at all. In fact, compared with Fox News, GB News is a huge hit in the UK.\u201d\\nThe Fox News model is not hugely useful to Frangopoulos and backers. The station had certain key advantages. In part, it was a case of right place, right time. In 1987 the US equivalent of Ofcom removed the Fairness Doctrine, which ruled broadcasters had to cover controversial issues in a fair and balanced manner. Although this didn\u2019t apply to cable TV, the resulting rise in political shock jocks on radio created a market for and a talent pool of opinionated presenters. Fox also had Rupert Murdoch\u2019s deep, deep pockets \u2013 the mogul spent $100 million on launching the channel. And Fox News only faced one clear rival, CNN.\\nGB News, on the other hand, is at the bottom of a list of 19 news channels on the electronic programme guide. It\u2019s as hard to find as it can be to watch \u2013 unless Dan Wootton yelling \u201cyou Lefties!\u201d is your idea of entertainment. Neither is outraging Liberals enough to grow in viewing figures. Nigel Farage\u2019s Acorn Antiques performance briefly made waves when he was on the beach attacking the RNLI, but viewing figures rarely correlated with the column inches and social media real estate dedicated to the channel\u2019s teething problems.\\nWhen I asked my 18-year-old daughter, who\u2019s been on Extinction Rebellion protests and criticises my use of gender pronouns over dinner, what she thought of GB News, she\u2019d barely heard of it. \u201cI think someone from Love Island went on it didn\u2019t they? And it\u2019s not doing very well.\u201d Anything else? \u201cNo.\u201d What\u2019s the point of a woke watch station if it doesn\u2019t irritate the woke? With the exception of a spike in RNLI donations, there\u2019s been more mocking than shocking from the Left side of the culture wars.\\nAnd perhaps this is the real issue for the channel. The UK is not yet experiencing the culture wars in the same way as the US and even when most people in the UK really disagree, we\u2019re not big on ranting. Research from the Reuters Institute in 2020 showed that, although support from politically partisan consumers on both the Left and Right has fallen by 20 percentage points since 2018, the BBC remains the most trusted national news outlet.

Its residents have kept going in the face of eviction attempts, harsh Scottish winters, and, at times, waning public interest in the anti-nuclear cause, with dwindling numbers nearly causing it to shut at one point.\\nToday, though, the huddle of rain-lashed caravans off the side of the A814 is once again in the spotlight - thanks to its role in the new BBC TV drama Vigil, the murder-mystery set on a Trident submarine.\\nThe camp is recreated in the show as the fictional Dunloch protest site, where detectives probe a romance between an activist and a murdered serviceman, who has been feeding her information about life on the submarine.\\nWhile the show has proved a ratings hit, such cloak-and-dagger plotlines have already been criticised by ex-Trident sailors for having a patchy relationship with reality. And on this - if nothing else - it would seem the protesters find common ground with the Royal Navy. They, too, have issues with the script's accuracy - so much so that they declined to let Vigil's creators film in the camp.\\n\"The BBC did approach us - they said they wanted to film some walk-through scenes, and intersperse them with footage shot in the fake peace camp that they'd built,\" Freeman, from Dumfries, tells me.\\n\"We said that we wanted to see the script first, and they told us it would feature one activist who was giving information to the Russians. That sounded unrealistic - as did the idea of an activist having a relationship with a sailor on the sub. They offered us \u00a3500, but in the end we said we just didn't want to do it.\"\\nNonetheless, the peace camp is still a colourful lens through which to view the story of the Faslane base, whose massive sheds sit behind electric fences just a mile further down the A814.\\nFaslane has been Britain's launch pad for World War III ever since the 1960s, when the deep waters of the Firth of Clyde were identified as an ideal spot for large submarines to come and go into the Atlantic.\\nBut when Margaret Thatcher decided to replace the base's ageing Polaris submarines with the new US-made Trident missile system, it became a focus for a revived anti-nuclear movement. The Cold War was at its height, and the government's newly-published Protect and Survive pamphlets, telling families how to build makeshift bomb shelters, had raised awareness of just how awful nuclear war would be. Many Scots also saw Thatcher's decision as Westminster high-handedness, placing Clydeside rather than London directly in the firing line.\\nThe camp was first set up in 1982 by Scottish CND members Margaret and Bobby Harrison, starting out with just a couple of pitched tents. Despite the midges, it attracted a new generation of volunteers, some drawn to the cause after watching Threads, the harrowing 1984 BBC drama about a nuclear attack on Sheffield.\\nIn the decades since, it has also been home to a ragtag mix of alternative tribes, from donkey-jacked socialists to punks and dreadlocked New Age Travellers. Anyone who lives there, though, needs a degree of commitment: Scotland's central west coast has one of Britain's wettest and windiest climates.\\n\"I went up there in winter once,\" recalls one visitor, more used to the gentler climes of Greenham Common protest camp in Berkshire. \"We were there so that some of the long-term residents could take a break - my only problem was that within about three hours, my tent was in about three inches of water.\"\\nToday the camp is more comfortable, with functioning toilets, showers and cooking facilities, powered by wood-burners. Vegetables are grown on site, and the residents hold regular open days for the public, complete with vegan curry. \u00a0Even so, though, it's not exactly glamping. \"It's quite a rural spot, four miles from the nearest town, and a lot of the day is spent just on camp maintenance - chopping wood, fixing caravans, getting the stove and hot water going and so on,\" says Freeman. \"The campaigning comes on top of that.\"\\nAt present, he is one of only five full-time residents, although they are backed by cadres of supporters nationwide, who come for periodic demonstrations at the base's gates. At times they also try to enter the base itself - which can not only disrupt its normal running, but also embarrass naval chiefs.\\n\"A couple of years ago, two campaigners actually managed to get on top of one of the submarines and ring its bell,\" says Andy. \"The navy was so embarrassed that it didn't even go to court.\"\\nOther protests have involved stopping convoys carrying nuclear materials - often tense encounters as the convoys are escorted by heavily armed MOD police. Many protesters have notched up dozens of convictions, like veteran protester Brian Quail, from Glasgow, who wedged himself underneath an armoured convoy vehicle in 2017. The retired Classics teacher told his court hearing that he was \"hindering an ongoing crime - the deployment of criminal and illegal weapons of mass destruction.\"\\nDespite such provocations, the camp encourages protesters to remain peaceful. \u00a0Some of Faslane's commanders are even said to take the view that the activists help keep them on their toes, highlighting weaknesses before terrorists can exploit them.\\nHowever, the idea of fraternisation between activists and naval staff, as depicted in Vigil, seems unlikely. According to Freeman, Faslane employees did occasionally used to visit the camp - \"either out of curiosity or conscience\" - but these days, the Navy's security staff are thought to forbid it. And while activists have occasionally had suspicions about being infiltrated by undercover police, they doubt their activities would be of much interest to Russian spies.\\n\"We do monitor the coming and going of the submarines to see if we can detect anything unusual going on, but the places we get information from is all public record anyway,\" Freeman says.\\nWith Greenham Common camp closing in 2000, following the removal of \u00a0cruise missiles from the nearby RAF base, Faslane is now the only permanent anti-nuclear camp in Britain. Its founders, the Harrisons, continued to visit until well into their 80s, although both have now passed away.\\nYet as memories of the Cold War fade, campaigning against nuclear weapons has become less of a preoccupation among younger generations. In 2013, Faslane nearly had to close down, due to a shortage of volunteers.\\n\"Younger people do seem more focused on the threat posed by climate change,\u201d Freeman says. \u201cBut we do get a lot of support from people like Extinction Rebellion, and it is pretty accepted that nuclear war is still very much a threat.\"\\nStill, with the Scottish Nationalist Party government pledging that an independent Scotland would remove Trident, the peace camp's residents may get their wish yet.\\nIn the meantime, they are digging in for another Scottish winter - although as the long nights draw in, it seems they won't be whiling them away by watching re-runs of Vigil.\\n\"At the end of the day, it's just another police procedural, isn't it?\" says Freeman. \"We saw the first couple of episodes, but we're not exactly desperate to watch the rest.\"", "image": [["'Until we get nuclear weapons removed from Scotland, we'll remain': Faslane Peace Camp, which was first set up in 1982", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tv/2021/09/13/TELEMMGLPICT000270789428_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?imwidth=680"], ["Rose Leslie and Lauren Lyle in Vigil's fictional recreation of Faslane Peace Camp", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tv/2021/09/13/TELEMMGLPICT000268489796_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["'Within about three hours, my tent was in about three inches of water': a resident of Faslane Peace Camp", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tv/2021/09/13/TELEMMGLPICT000270789427_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["Faslane co-founder Margaret Harrison with her husband Bobby in 2002", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tv/2021/09/13/TELEMMGLPICT000000665310_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqdTOTs03EjuZb891uz-lkHWvmsZawOkrGzifjmJ5EcoA.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["Ministry of Defence personel escort a naked anti-nuclear protester from Faslane Peace Camp out of Loch Long, Scotland, in 1999, after attempting to swim to the final Trident nuclear submarine HMS Vengeance", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tv/2021/09/13/TELEMMGLPICT000003835270_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqPkPWLXP_iG_X2Wo3V95CStEgVipCcYG_lNXo9zZTqHc.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["HM Naval Base Clyde, also known as Faslane, in Scotland", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2021/03/26/TELEMMGLPICT000087338464_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqKjggCdpvXjoraOzAlyzu1OZ4rIwMkIxkKo_v8-HMYxA.jpeg?imwidth=350"]], "author": ["Colin Freeman"], "date": "2021-09-13"}, "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comedy/comedians/geoff-norcott-mash-report-right-wing-comedy-farce-moral-certainty/": {"title": "Geoff Norcott on The Mash Report, Right-wing comedy and the farce of moral certainty", "subtitle": "Back on our screens, the satirical comedy show is one of the few shows to take on the woke orthodoxy, argues the conservative comedian", "text": "The Mash Report, the satirical comedy show I\u2019ve been a part of since it began in 2017, was publicly cancelled by the BBC in March. I understand the majority of the Telegraph readership won\u2019t have shed many tears over this decision. It might even have been accompanied by the odd sound of a popping cork.\\nHowever, as it returns this week, on the Freeview channel Dave, I would urge readers of this newspaper to give Mash a chance (next week I\u2019m suggesting Extinction Rebellion give Top Gear a watch). To this day, The Mash Report \u2013 now called Late Night Mash \u2013 is the only topical comedy show on British TV that makes a regular place for anybody right-of-centre (that\u2019s me, by the way). And despite its reputation, the show has always had the occasional gag at the Left\u2019s expense. In series one, Andrew Hunter Murray did a great report about a detective trying to hunt down the Labour Party\u2019s Brexit policy. Thanks to Labour\u2019s Brexit paralysis, I was able to do a similar piece a series later.\\nThe Mash producers took a chance on me in 2017 and, at the time, we didn\u2019t know how well it would work. The studio audiences did tend to be left-leaning, though not exclusively and, crucially, they were fair. It\u2019s fun for me to be in the position of the outsider swimming against the comedic tide. That\u2019s the great thing about the comedy industry \u2013 a bloke like me, who actually represents mainstream opinions and says what many people are thinking, gets to look a bit edgy purely by dint of context. In reality I\u2019m about as edgy as James Blunt eating a Lemon & Herb Nandos.\\nGiven people on either wing seem disappointed with the political parties at present, there\u2019s a chance Mash will be more representative than before. Some of the Right, for instance, are at odds with Johnson. My Leftie friends often ask me if I regret voting for a Conservative government. The main thing I regret is not getting one.\\nAnd large parts of the Left are cross with Starmer for not taking any definitive stances and generally seeming like the first bloke your mum dates after getting divorced. Labour\u2019s main policy on Covid has been to say things should have been done a bit sooner, a bit later or moan that no one ever listens to them. That\u2019s not opposition, that\u2019s nagging.\\nWhat else makes Mash different? Well, I\u2019ve done a few panel shows and quite often you make jokes about politics rather than because of politics. That\u2019s not the same as satire. When a political subject comes up on a panel show everyone rattles off their gags and it\u2019s great entertainment. If someone quips that Jacob Rees-Mogg looks like a Victorian ghost it\u2019ll get a good laugh, but it\u2019s gone in a heartbeat. What Mash has the capacity to do \u2013 even more so in this longer format on Dave \u2013 is sustain a focus on a subject, put it under proper scrutiny. That\u2019s a unique opportunity for a comic. In series three, in a piece on how dismal Labour had been, I said of the anti-semitism accusations against Corbyn that he was like a gangster\u2019s wife, insofar as he \u201chadn\u2019t killed anybody personally, but had seen a lot of shovels go missing from the shed\u201d. However left-wing you might have found the rest of the show, there wasn\u2019t much other political comedy in 2018 giving a platform to opinions like that.\\nMaking jokes about both sides of the political spectrum is completely natural to me, having grown up in a politically divided household. People assume it\u2019s hard to be a right-wing comedian in Britain at the moment, but I\u2019d say the opposite. My left-wing colleagues are much more at risk of a pile-on than me \u2013 people on the Left are under more pressure from people on the Left. If you step out of line or if you have the wrong opinions on hot button issues, they\u2019ll get told off. The Left do have a tendency to devour their own.\\nI\u2019d love to tell you that among the cast I\u2019m the odd one out on the Mash set, that I have a separate dressing room \u2013 that they eat their vegan wraps while I tuck into some veal. But the truth is we all get on. I find the idea of putting barriers up to people who don\u2019t think like you a bit intellectually embarrassing. \u201cI won\u2019t be friends with a Leaver\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ve never kissed a Tory\u201d, that sort of thing. The inference is that the person who says it is an awesome person simply because of where they put a cross on their ballot paper once every five years. I\u2019d argue being a good human being is a little more complicated than that \u2013 you\u2019re not the sum total of e-petitions or how many witty banners you\u2019ve had appear on Newsnight.\\nI know it\u2019s not all Lefties, but the ones that engage in this sort of grand-standing exhibit amusing levels of moral certainty. I remember reading Twelfth Night for my A Levels, at a time when the Right were more censorious and people like Mary Whitehouse made conservatism look as cool as Justin Trudeau in a beige suit. I find it amazing that Malvolio, the puritan who\u2019d tell people off for what they did or didn\u2019t do, has changed in a generation. From sounding like a fusty old right-winger he now comes off like a modern figure from the Hard Left. There\u2019s been a changing of the guard on censorship, free speech and libertarian instincts which has been astonishing to watch unfold. I often see \u201cwoke\u201d types use the phrase \u201cfree speech warrior\u201d as an insult. I wonder if they realise that to most of Britain that might sound like a decent thing to be.\\nHere\u2019s another thing. The Left aren\u2019t the only ones riven by irony these days. The cultural Right, having been at first surprised then accustomed to their new reputation as the more easy going ones are starting to show signs of contradiction. Freaking out over cancel culture but also losing their minds when someone doesn\u2019t wear a poppy. Speaking out over deplatforming, but staying quiet when it suits them. And I look forward to taking the p*** out of everybody when the new series starts. Why limit yourself? There are numpties on all sides.\\nLate Night Mash starts on Dave tonight at 10pm.

In Brown Hart Gardens, overlooked by stately red-brick buildings, a vast squiggle of candy-coloured trumpets sprout from the tarmac like a novel species of triffid.\\nNo, it\u2019s not another Extinction Rebellion caper (though it\u2019s likely to prove equally divisive). Instead, it\u2019s Sonic Bloom, London\u2019s latest piece of public sculpture. Sorry, not \u201csculpture\u201d \u2013 instead, try \u201ccommunity-focused multi-sensory installation\u201d. Sonic Bloom is \u201ccurated\u201d by Alter-Projects and designed by \u201csound artist, designer and electronic musician\u201d, Yuri Suzuki.\\nNor is this the most egregious eyesore to arrive on the capital\u2019s streets in recent months. That honour belongs to the \u00a36million Marble Arch Mound, which sits near Hyde Park\u2019s Speaker\u2019s Corner. Crowned the \u201cworst attraction in London\u201d, it has been compared to a \u201cTeletubby hill\u201d and an ill-rendered chunk of Super Mario scenery. To my mind, it recalls a moth-eaten dry-ski slope, as designed by someone who\u2019d never been skiing \u2013 or, for that matter, seen a slope.\\nIt\u2019s not only London that has come down with a nasty case of bad public art. Across the Atlantic, Brookfield Properties, one of the many conglomerates energetically re-shaping the New York skyline, has opened Citrovia. It\u2019s an elegant solution to a problem of their own design. The construction of Brookfield\u2019s Manhattan West project, comprising four towers, requires a massive construction shed that blots out the sky.\\nCitrovia, therefore, is designed to bring sunny vibes to mole-like office workers: the shed\u2019s ceiling is hung with billowing fabric, spot-lit a deep, cloudless blue. Below, visitors amble through a psychedelic grove of giant plastic lemon trees and lemon slices. Citrovia even has its own specially commissioned scent, pumped out at regular intervals: \u201ca gender-neutral vegan cologne\u201d.\\nWhy has there been such a flourishing of public sculpture in the last few decades? Partly it\u2019s about money. As more real estate falls into the hands of private developers and speculators, public art \u2013 often bafflingly obscure and expensive \u2013 becomes a sop to authorities trying to preserve some degree of the public realm; it\u2019s a more convenient concession to the great unwashed than, say, genuinely affordable housing.\\nThe pandemic has been a particular spur. While predictions of the death of the city centre appear to have been premature, local authorities have mounted many initiatives to entice citizens from their work-from-home cocoons, such as Sadiq Khan\u2019s (ill-defined) Let\u2019s Do London campaign. The pandemic has fundamentally skewed our urban compasses; public artworks are the shiny gobbits to tempt us back into the rat race.\\nBut such forebodings about the death of the urban realm are not new. In the early 1970s, things looked equally bleak \u2013 the 1971 Nixon Shock had sent inflation spiralling, driving the global economy towards recession. Meanwhile, in the UK, unions had the country in a death grip; with Edward Heath\u2019s Conservatives unable to trim their wicks, widespread industrial action was a continual threat, eventually leading to the three-day week in 1974 and the rationing of essential utilities. The Swinging Sixties came to a sudden halt. The national spirit needed a jump-start \u2013 and fast.\\nIn 1972, Jeremy Rees, the founding director of Bristol\u2019s Arnolfini Gallery, proposed an ambitious solution: he invited 15 leading sculptors to build large-scale artworks across eight British cities, including Birmingham, Plymouth, Liverpool, Sheffield and Southampton. The initiative, dubbed \u201cCity Sculpture Projects\u201d, was funded by the Peter Stuyvesant Foundation, an organisation backed by a South African tobacco firm, and assisted by the Arts Council of Great Britain. It aimed to bring public art back into everyday life, and renew cultural engagement for the new decade.\\nAn initial list of 240 artists was drawn up; this was then narrowed down to 46, then to 24. That final list included a mix of well-established names, such as Ivor Williams, and ambitious up-and-coming figures such as Liliane Lijn, then recently out of art school. The brief was enticingly vague, Lijn tells me over a video-call from her home in Italy.\\n\u201cLimitations? No, there were no limitations,\u201d she says. \u201cThey just took us to various sites that they thought might be appropriate. And that was it. They didn\u2019t say, \u2018We\u2019d like a sculpture that relates to the city.\u2019\u201d\\nLijn was commissioned with John Panting to provide two sculptures for Plymouth. Her piece, White Koan, was a rotating six metre-high pyramid with a thread of electric light running around its sides; Panting\u2019s Work for North Cross Roundabout, was a vast ethereal metal cross, suspended by steel cables, hanging above a pedestrianised underpass. Both artists, alongside the other 13 sculptors whose works made it past the drawing board, were given \u00a31,000 for labour and materials (around \u00a312,500 in today\u2019s money). In total, the budget for the City Sculpture Projects was \u00a340,000 (roughly \u00a3500,000 today).\\nIn October 1971, the shortlist of 24 proposals was whittled down to 16. Production of the full-size artworks took place between November 1971 and March 1972. Yet even before they were installed, the projects caused a stir. At the time, the anti-apartheid movement was gathering pace, and the links between smoking and poor health were being widely publicised. Sponsorship by a leading South African tobacco firm was not a great look. (The leading conceptual artist Michael Craig-Martin was invited to submit a proposal, but turned it down, saying: \u201cThe deliberately hidden association with tobacco was enough for me to say no.\u201d)\\nMeanwhile, William Tucker\u2019s sculpture Beulah, a Curly-Wurly of steel tubes, was moved from Liverpool to Newcastle after Liverpool City Council protested at Stuyvesant\u2019s involvement. Councillors called the City Sculpture Projects \u201c[a] cigarette company\u2019s insidious campaign to infiltrate people\u2019s lives\u201d.\\nThis, however, was far from the end of the controversy. The majority of the sculptures were, like Panting and Lijn\u2019s work, abstract works playing with space, materials and form; they were designed to reflect and riff on the hard edges and sharp contours of the cityscape. There was one prominent exception, though: Nicholas Munro\u2019s two-storey-high King Kong, a pot-bellied leering gorilla, menacing Birmingham\u2019s Bull Ring shopping centre. Munro had never seen the film, but picked King Kong as a subject because he said at the time: \u201cthe project had to be city-orientated and the giant gorilla was city-disorientated, which was as good a reason as any.\u201d\\nMunro\u2019s outsized ape became the poster boy for the entire enterprise. Its trip up the M4 on the back of a flat-bed truck was covered by the national press: \u201cThe King-Sized Hand Signal\u201d, ran the Daily Mirror\u2019s headline. Its installation was largely greeted with bemusement. One man joked that \u201che would make a good centre[-half] for [Aston] Villa\u201d. Within a week, the gorilla had \u201cVilla\u201d graffitied across his chest.\\nBut while the sculpture was begrudgingly adopted by Brummies, the city council were less keen. When it looked like it might be brought by an American collector, they seemed eager to wash their hands of it. A campaign was launched to keep it in the city, but by July 1972, it was running out of steam. One of Kong\u2019s stout-hearted defenders, Nellie Shannon, a lollipop lady, even had her \u00a31 donation returned by its organisers. \u201cI help more than 1,000 children across the road every day and I know they love the statue,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe statue gives me a sense of security.\u201d\\nYet King Kong continued to be part of city life. That summer, 3,000 building workers gathered in Manzoni Gardens, where it was sited, to protest against pay and working conditions. Two builders scaled the sculpture, placed a hard hat on its head and placed a giant trowel and a hod in its hands.\\nAfter its stint in the city centre, it spent three years outside a used-car dealer, before moving to Edinburgh and the Lake District, where it loomed incongruously among dry-stone walls and rolling green fields. Munro himself likewise stepped away from the limelight: he is now a reclusive physicist studying perpetual motion in the hope of disproving Newton\u2019s Third Law of Motion; he lives in a remote Dorset cottage with no electricity or running water.\\nIn fact, none of the sculptures remained in place. At the end of their six-month exhibit period, the cities had the option to buy their pieces. None did. Several, such as Peter Hide\u2019s anvil-like Compression Pillar and Bryan Kneale\u2019s Astonia in Southampton, were unceremoniously destroyed. Others provoked fierce backlashes. Both L Brower Hatcher\u2019s Untitled (Colour Field Sculpture), a thicket of coloured wires, and Barry Flanagan\u2019s Work for Cambridge, four squiggly totem poles stretching to the sky, were vandalised. A vicar in the quiet university city went as far as to make a public appeal for someone to blow up Flanagan\u2019s contribution. And William Turnball\u2019s six-part, stainless-steel Angle in Liverpool was ruefully assessed by his fellow sculptor Arthur Dooley: \u201cThe kids will eat this one.\u201d\\nYet some of the artists relished the bafflement their pieces generated. Garth Evans recorded the reflections of passersby in tongue-in-cheek audio diaries. His slab-like recumbent steel pillar, Work for The Hayes, prompted a local butcher to ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s it supposed to be? Tell me, what is it? What\u2019s the idea of putting it there? It\u2019s a sculpture, and I suppose that\u2019s modern art, is it? It\u2019s just angles and that\u2019s it to me, I can\u2019t see any form of anything in it.\u201d\\nLijn\u2019s Koan had a happier fate. After a spell outside the Globe Theatre, it now sits at the entrance to Warwick University\u2019s Arts Centre. \u201cIt\u2019s greatly loved by the students,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt has its own website, Twitter page. They worship it \u2013 it\u2019s a good-luck mascot. They take a little cone with them when they go on University Challenge.\u201d\\nThe sculpture, though, suffered from 20 years without maintenance. And when its motors began to seize up, the vice-chancellor tried to destroy it. \u201cThe students went on strike, there were big protests. So they had to restore it. And they asked me to come in and help.\u201d\\nWhy does she think Plymouth City Council didn\u2019t adopt her sculpture? \u201cBecause they were philistines! They didn\u2019t have the first clue about what art is,\u201d she laughs. \u201cThere was no education in schools \u2013 or there certainly wasn\u2019t in 1972 \u2013 which would allow people to appreciate art as they do in so many other countries, such as Italy, where I am now.\\n\u201c[But] I don\u2019t think public art always causes a scandal. And every time it\u2019s for a different reason. For instance, my cone on the Isle of Wight caused a stir which lasted almost two years. People thought the hospital had put money into the art when it should have gone on beds and doctors. But the press got it all wrong.\u201d\\nShe points to the recent examples of the Diana sculpture at Kensington Palace, and Maggi Hambling\u2019s controversial Mary Wollstonecraft-inspired piece in north London. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t like them, but frankly they\u2019re not very likeable. Put up something dreadful and people are going to call it out.\u201d\\nYet public art can spark conversations and raise spirits. The post-war Labour government, for instance, flushed with the idea that culture should be accessible to the masses, in 1951 launched the Festival of Britain, an ambitious celebration of science and the arts. It featured 60 painters and 12 sculptors, alongside theatre, scientific showcases and technology fairs. And it attracted millions of visitors, as well as reimagining the artist\u2019s role in society. No longer dependent on private patronage, it gave artists the confidence to respond to, and be enmeshed in, everyday life.\\nCan something similar be achieved now in the post-Covid era? Lijn is not so sure. \u201cLots of people want art to be pure entertainment. And plenty of public art goes that way. But if art becomes completely emptied of meaning, then there\u2019s no point having art. You might as well go to Disneyland.\u201d\\nBut perhaps there is hope. After all, public art \u2013 whether a colossal gorilla or an ignominious mound \u2013 is an invitation. It\u2019s an invitation to carp and scoff; an invitation to threaten violence or vandalism. But, most of all, it\u2019s an invitation to consider the city in a different way: to see it as a playful space, in constant process of self-discovery. A place which is always growing up.\\n\u201cThere seemed to be a clear cut division of opinion between the elderly and the young,\u201d Lijn wrote of the reactions to her sculpture, in an accompanying essay shortly after its construction. \u201cEspecially the children who dragged on their mother\u2019s coat-sleeves to stop and look at this strange new adventure, which had suddenly appeared.\u201d", "image": [["Nicholas Munro\u2019s two-storey-high King Kong in Birmingham\u2019s Bull Ring", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/art/2021/09/27/TELEMMGLPICT000272765587_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqX0kxSjxoDpjMU82a4enB3U5HFnKf4ATkdnbzkGdFBG4.jpeg?imwidth=680"], ["Yuri Suzuki's Sonic Bloom, currently in situ in Mayfair, London", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/art/2021/09/29/TELEMMGLPICT000272022265_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqMRgC_Ccxc8RBXbv5WpjFkj0BfgITsmJeLLkNDIpFOrM.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["Marble Arch Mound, the \u00a36million eyesore that has been dubbed the \u201cworst attraction in London\u201d", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/art/2021/09/27/TELEMMGLPICT000265806724_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqeo_i_u9APj8RuoebjoAHt-a-90u71-_kcfkywl_shTM.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["The King Kong sculpture on display at the Manzoni Gardens in Birmingham", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/art/2021/09/27/TELEMMGLPICT000272765585_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqoXJUJZ2koYGvlQ_O-BqYxr6Xj2WECU5tGTp4vDMBGsY.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["Liliane Lijn\u2019s White Koan now sits at the entrance to Warwick University\u2019s Arts Centre", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/art/2021/09/27/TELEMMGLPICT000272766019_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?imwidth=350"]], "author": ["Alex  Diggins"], "date": "2021-09-29"}}
