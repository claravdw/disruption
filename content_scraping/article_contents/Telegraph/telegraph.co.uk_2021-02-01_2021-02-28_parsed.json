His 18-year-old daughter, Blue, is in London, hiding in 100ft of makeshift tunnels beneath Euston Square Gardens in protest against HS2\u00a0and she\u2019s driving her poor father crazy with worry.\\n\u201cI\u2019m longing for the moment when she comes out,\u201d he says tearfully\u00a0on a video call from his shed, the only place on the island to have a phone signal. \u201cI find myself bursting into tears with no warning. It\u2019s so symbolic, her being underground. It\u2019s like something out of Greek mythology.\u201d\\nIt\u2019s been more than two weeks now since Blue, the youngest of Sandford\u2019s four children and Britain\u2019s answer to Greta Thunberg, entered the tunnels with a group of six other protesters.\u00a0\u00a0Initially, Sandford\u2019s son, Lazer, 21, was down there, too, guarding the entry shaft with his body; he had his arm encased in a steel tube inside a wrought-iron safe buried in concrete. But he gave himself up last week\u00a0in return for lighting and sanitary products for his fellow campaigners who include Daniel Hooper, the 47-year-old green campaigner better known as \u201cSwampy\u201d,\u00a0and his 16-year-old son, Rory.\\nSandford believes Blue \u2013 who has been on a school strike since she completed her GCSEs at private school in north London\u00a0and whose book, Challenge Everything, encourages other young people to step up to save the world \u2013 has enough food to last her for six weeks. She\u2019s keeping in touch with him and her mother, who lives in London, via her mobile phone, which has reception at the bottom of one of the down shafts. \u201cI keep asking her if she\u2019s okay and she sounds upbeat and resolute when I speak to her, but she\u2019s facing horrific experiences \u2013 I\u2019m very concerned for her safety,\u201d he says.\\nThere\u2019s no doubt that the tunnels are a dark and dangerous place, wholly unsuitable for those without hard hats and proper safety equipment. Machinery including cherry pickers could destablise the tunnels, according to safety experts, and there are currently no oxygen monitors. Lazer has told his father that he had been trampled and, at one point, caught his neck in a rope. \u201cI was sent a video [of him choking] and it sounds like someone is dying,\u201d Sandford says. \u201cI was really shocked to discover what\u2019s going on down there \u2013 the risks they are taking. It\u2019s extremely difficult and painful to watch.\u201d\\nHis only comfort is the fact that Blue is tough as old boots, having divided her childhood between Gometra, where the temperature inside the house is currently three degrees and there is no hot water, and an off-grid house in north-west London, where the family lives in a tent in the living room during the winter months. \u201cMy father\u2019s house was similar and so was my grandparents\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s not a hardship once you get used to it,\u201d he says.\\nShe\u2019s also her father\u2019s daughter when it comes to safety. \u201cYou have to be a stickler for safety if you\u2019re going to survive in a place like this,\u201d Sandford says, gesturing towards the window of his hut\u00a0from\u00a0which you can see nothing but sky, rock and sea. \u201cBlue has a sardonic wit, as if she sees through folly in all forms and she thinks for herself. I love her so much,\u201d he adds, wistfully.\\nIf he had his way, she would be studying for her A-levels. \u201cI\u2019m a great believer in education as being an important route to freedom in life, so I have always wanted to stress this with my children,\u201d he says. Her teachers at King Alfred School in Hampstead begged him to try to influence her into staying on; they told him she could do anything. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad to watch her turning her back on it, but I completely understand that she\u2019s not being given a choice, her generation isn\u2019t.\u201d\\nSandford has spent the past few years watching all four of his children evolve into hardcore activists: his eldest daughter, Savannah, 22, from his first marriage, protested naked in the House of Commons on April Fools\u2019 Day 2019 during a Brexit debate; Lazer and Blue poured oil over themselves in the National Portrait Gallery in protest against BP\u2019s sponsorship.\\nThere have various dicey moments; Savannah, was cut free after she D-locked herself to furniture at an oil industry dinner in Edinburgh\u00a0and Lazer was removed from a tree at another HS2 protest in Denham, Buckinghamshire.\\nSandford is aware, though, that his children are just chips off the old block. Since his early 20s, Sandford been challenging the existing order through protests, demonstrations and disruption; his proudest moments as an activist include successfully challenging plans for new salmon farms on the west coast (four out of five were cancelled), and chaining himself to the bottom of a truck on Waterloo Bridge during the Extinction Rebellion last March.\\n\u201cI learnt early on that you need to hold your nerve against authorities. They aren\u2019t necessarily right\u00a0and they aren\u2019t necessarily going to win,\u201d he says.\\nIs he tempted to join her in the tunnel? Sandford shakes his shaggy locks. \u201cI\u2019m terrified of it,\u201d he says.\u201c I don\u2019t think I\u2019m as brave as the children, but I\u2019ve been in similar places in terms of challenging things I didn\u2019t think was right.\u201d\\nWhen Cato, his eldest son, was born, he felt a homing instinct to return to place he\u2019d grown up and raise his children close to nature, using as little carbon as possible. \u201cThe problem is that with the climate and nature breaking down, it\u2019s getting harder to bring your children up in the wilderness. Surely this is as good a reason as any to do something about it?\u201d he says.\\nCato was two when Sandford bought Gometra\u00a0and the family began living off-grid, farming sheep for a living. At first, Sandford used a diesel generator to power his cooker and washing machine and drove about on a quad bike and Land Rover, but gradually these \u201cguzzling off-grid\u201d items broke\u00a0and he began living even more frugally \u2013 without central heating or mains power, charging his mobile, laptop, torches and power tools via a solar panel.\\nEven for babies, it\u2019s no hardship living in these conditions, he says, so long as you have the right blankets and clothing, although he does admit to using disposable nappies. \u201cYou learn how to dry clothes when it\u2019s damp, and diagnose yourself rather than dashing to the doctor,\u201d he says. \u201cI like the fact that I don\u2019t have broadband and I have to go to my shed to get phone signal. It means I can be proactive rather than all the time reacting.\u201d\\nThe only real stumbling block to family life on Gometra was the lack of schooling. Sandford toyed with the idea of homeschooling, but eventually opted to educate the children in London, fearing it would be too insular on the island where there are only two other households, his tenants. Following the breakdown of his two marriages\u00a0his former wives based themselves in London, so the situation suited everyone\u00a0and, while the children would cry when they left Gometra for the mainland at the end of the holidays, he\u2019s pleased that they learnt to survive in the urban jungle as well as in the wilderness.\\nSandford admits that the new high-speed rail link wasn\u2019t on his radar until the children went into the Euston Square tunnels, but he stands by their protest, even though the Government has said that the cost of tackling climate activists at HS2 sites has hit nearly \u00a350 million. He believes that there is no place in the world for a new fast train network, requiring a huge amount of carbon. \u201cPeople are in denial; the world has changed \u2013 it\u2019s like the third runway at Heathrow and the coalmine in Cumbria \u2013 the sooner these projects are cancelled, the less money is wasted and the fewer lives are put at risk,\u201d he says.\\nBut what about those who need this infrastructure for their jobs, or to get to university or a hospital appointment? One could argue that it\u2019s a bit rich for a family with a private island and multiple homes and private schooling to try to jeopardise new commuter links for the sake of ancient trees.\\nSandford is well aware of his privilege. During our conversation, he reiterates on several occasions that he knows how fortunate he is to have grown up close to nature, to be financially comfortable even without the income streams from his farm and lodger. It would be ridiculous, though, he says, if people didn\u2019t try to protect our crumbling environment simply because they were in a fortunate position. \u201cTo say people who are fortunate shouldn\u2019t try to save the environment doesn\u2019t make any sense. Everyone is going to have to do something \u2013 we\u2019re all going to have to stick our necks out.\u201d\\nBesides, his children might be \u201caristo activists\u201d, but they aren\u2019t trustafarians. They\u2019re no longer supported by him financially, he says: Savannah does without money, Cato works for an environmental think tank, Lazer works as a building site labourer and Blue earns money from her writing.\\n\u201cNone of them buy anything much\u00a0and they hardly ever use money. They live much of the time in protest camps or with friends,\u201d he says. A mutual friend points out that they probably find the world quite a difficult place to be in right now. \u201cMost people can\u2019t give up \u2018necessities\u2019 such as heating\u00a0but they\u2019ve been brought up not to need them,\u201d he says. \u201cThey feel extinction is imminent, and yet no one is listening because they\u2019re focused on day-to-day living.\u201d\\nSandford wishes for Blue\u2019s sake that she wouldn\u2019t have to face the law when she emerges from the tunnels; courts are never fun, he says. \u201cBut the experiences of Gandhi, Martin Luther King and the suffragettes show us that when a government isn\u2019t doing what it needs to be doing in a crisis, non-violent direct action is a way to wake it up.\u201d", "image": [["Roc Sandford's daughter Blue is currently in tunnels beneath Euston Square Gardens", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2021/02/12/250777779_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq0ilzbT_7ObbKLxxvXs6alT0EAXHfv0qGj0bMZamh28Y.jpg?imwidth=680"]], "author": ["Anna Tyzack"], "date": "2021-02-13"}, "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/tom-brady-might-look-like-living-dream-details-life-sound-deathly/": {"title": "Tom Brady might look like he's living the dream but the details of his life sound deathly dull", "subtitle": "NFL hero and Gisele B\u00fcndchen are the undisputed golden power couple of the moment but you notice the absence of anything you\u00a0might call fun", "text": "Tom Brady, as you will know, is the hero of the hour in the US, having become the oldest quarterback at 43 (almost twice the age of his opposite number) to win a Superbowl title, his seventh.\\nBut that\u2019s just the icing on the cake. Brady could be the poster boy for all-American manhood. His name could not be more all-American, unless it were Buzz. He has the square-jawed good looks of Captain America. He\u2019s loaded (something to do with a private jet rental service just valued at $2.1\u2009billion). And he\u2019s married to Gisele B\u00fcndchen, the Brazilian supermodel who \u2013 many would argue \u2013 outshines all the other supers with her thoroughbred body and thousand-yard smile. Together, they\u2019re the undisputed golden power couple of the moment \u2013 beautiful, rich, and age-defying. When they\u2019re pictured out on the town together \u2013 him in his Versace DJ and polo neck, her in a strapless dress split to the hip \u2013 the world gawps and marvels and feels very small.\\nOr maybe not quite so much any more. Because what few of us appreciated until this week is just what it takes to be Mr and Mrs Brady Body. For him, it\u2019s a regimen that starts at 5.30am and ends with bed at 8.30pm. In between, there\u2019s an awful lot of electrolyte water drinking (five litres), exercise and massage. Both he and Gisele eat an 80:20 plant-based/animal-based diet \u2013 no red\u00a0meat, no white flour, etc. He stops eating three hours before bed, though the electrolyte-sipping continues. Those evening dress pictures, if you think about it \u2013 allowing for journey home, shower, putting on the athlete recovery PJs (seriously) \u2013 have to be taken no later than 6.45pm, 7pm, tops, on a treat night.\\nOnce you have all the details of Body world laid before you, you very quickly begin to notice the absence of anything you might call fun. Sexy it is not. The bedroom thermostat is set to 18C (64F) and the Beautyrest Black mattress is designed to prevent his body from overheating \u2026 so you do the maths.\\nIs Gisele even in this performance-maximising sleep area? One can only wonder. And if she is, it\u2019s reasonable to imagine she\u2019s not wearing a Victoria\u2019s Secret, feather-trimmed basque, or a satin pyjama top, or a football shirt (we wish) but an eye mask, lymphatic drainage boots, nasal cannula for the delivery of pure oxygen, face mask, hair protector and mouth guard. At least four of those are standard bedwear for Love Island hopefuls, after all.\\nWe\u2019ve all grown up and learnt a lot about health and wealth over the past few years. No one looks back wistfully to the good old days when George Best counted being three sheets to the wind \u2013 and under the sheets with Miss World by 3am the night before \u2013 as being match fit. Then again \u2026 what do they do for laughs? How do they relax? When do the Bodys let their hair down?\\nOr, to put it another way, let\u2019s never\u00a0wish to be super-fit, gorgeous and rich, ever again.\\nWho punched the air when Hugh Dennis said that he\u2019d like to do another series of Outnumbered? Who didn\u2019t love Outnumbered? And now that we\u2019re older and they are older (the actor who plays Karen is 19) wouldn\u2019t it be fun, albeit of a different variety, to revisit family life with the Brockmans? You know \u2026 Karen gets superglued to a bus in an Extinction Rebellion demo and lives in a tent in the garden, Ben becomes a spoken-word poet, etc? Also, Hugh Dennis and Claire Skinner are now a couple in real life. Which, let\u2019s face it, is reason enough to tune in.\\nBe bursting with gratitude for the French drama on All\u00a04? It\u2019s called Torn, but we\u2019d watch it if it were called See French People Acting, because that\u2019s all we want to do. It\u2019s not clear why this has happened. It may be to do with subtitles (love them, make us concentrate, everything feels more significant) and while we haven\u2019t gone off Scandi noir, it is a smaller pond; all the actors crop up in everything and all the interiors look the same. Meanwhile, French drama \u2013 from Call My Agent! to Spiral \u2013 is invariably glamorous, racy, pacy and sexy, with good clothes. Anyway. Phew.", "image": [["The new rules of A-list celebrity?

Recently it was revealed that a New York Times cover shot of actress Zo\u00eb Kravitz was taken by Taylor Swift, who happened to be in her bubble. The actual photographer, Christopher Anderson, directed Kravitz, and Swift\u2019s camera, through video call from Paris.\\nHarriman, who was born in Nigeria but moved to Britain as a child, is the son of Chief Hope Harriman, a businessman and politician once described as \u201cone of the founding fathers of modern Nigeria\u201d. He attended Bradfield College in Berkshire before moving into the social circles of aristocrats, celebrities and royalty.\\nAfter a career in the City of London, he reportedly went into business with former tennis player Boris Becker, and became director of the British network of polo games called British Polo Day, before launching What We Seee in 2016.\\nHe has been friends with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex for years, and may have seen their \u201clove story\u201d, as his Instagram caption had it, blossom far earlier than their wedding day. It was reported in the explosive 2020 book about the Sussexes, Finding Freedom, that the Duchess \u2013 then Meghan Markle \u2013 dined with Harriman at Mayfair private members\u2019 club 5 Hertford Street on the eve of her blind date with Prince Harry.\\nUntil 2017, Harriman ran \u2013 and still runs \u2013 a media company called What We Seee, but maintained a lifelong passion for photography. His wife, Camilla Holmstroem, encouraged him to turn the hobby into a profession, and since then his ascent has been breakneck.\\nIn just over three years he has photographed Hollywood stars such as Tom Cruise, Cate Blanchett and Olivia Coleman, musicians such as Rihanna and Stormzy, and taken the engagement portraits of the Duke of Sussex\u2019s cousin, Princess Beatrice, and her husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.\\nLast September, with his images of Marcus Rashford and model Adwoa Aboah, he became the first black male photographer to ever shoot a cover in British Vogue\u2019s 104-year history.

The Telegraph attempted to put this allegation to UAF last Saturday\\nLord Walney warned that MPs\u2019 endorsement of these groups increases the \u201crisk that a far-Left minority could mire noble and essential movements for change in unacceptable violent tactics in the future\u201d.\\nHis intervention comes after the SWP faced allegations, including from a leading racial justice campaigner, a prominent academic and an MP, of trying to hijack the Black Lives Matter movement last summer. The party had placed itself at the heart of protests and hosted Zoom sessions entitled \u201cBLM: Racism, resistance and revolution meetings\u201d.\\nThe SWP denied the allegation at the time, saying it had supported BLM demonstrations in the US, Britain and across the world, but insisting it had \u201cnot sought to take over the movement\u201d.\\nLord Walney also raised concerns that the leadership of Black Lives Matter UK have \u201cpushed a very hardline and absolutist view\u201d about defunding the police, which he predicted was \u201ca world away from where the vast majority of BLM [supporters] would be\u201d.\\nThat niche agenda \u201crisks taking attention away from really legitimate and urgent debates on reform which may need to be had\u201d about racism and wider society, he said.\\nLabour and figures on the mainstream-Left have also distanced themselves from some of BLM UK\u2019s calls. Last June, Sir Keir Starmer said it was \u201ca shame\u201d the sentiment behind the movement had become \u201ctangled up with these organisational issues\u201d and branded the demand to defund the police \u201cnonsense\u201d.\\nReports have also emerged of communist and socialist cells attempting to use Extinction Rebellion (XR) as a trojan horse to pursue their far-Left aims.\\nAn XR spokesman hit out at \u201cparasitical\u201d organisations staging \u201cworrying\u201d infiltration attempts last September, but said he believed such bids would be unsuccessful and that the environmental group was \u201cbigger than that\u201d.\\nLord Walney will examine the entryism allegations as well as the radical tactics deployed by the group, which has the stated aim of using nonviolent civil disobedience to push for government action on climate change.\\nThe Home Secretary has claimed some XR activists are \u201cso-called eco-crusaders turned criminals\u201d who threaten key pillars of national life.\\nShe has described the group as an \u201cemerging threat\u201d that has wrought \u201canarchy\u201d on the streets, and has heaped scorn on its attempts to interrupt economic activity and \u201cthwart the media\u2019s right to publish without fear nor favour\u201d after besieging newspaper printing sites.", "image": [["Extinction Rebellion activists gesture next to signs at a makeshift camp, as others occupy tunnels under Euston Square Gardens to protest against the HS2 high-speed railway in London", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2021/01/27/TELEMMGLPICT000249579029_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqkXbkQY4xF11YSbIjVXCcoqbhEzXW48tX4Vy2uuQc4DA.jpeg?imwidth=680"]], "author": ["Lucy Fisher"], "date": "2021-02-07"}}
