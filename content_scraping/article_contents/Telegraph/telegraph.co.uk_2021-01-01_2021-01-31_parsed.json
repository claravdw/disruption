They accuse the authorities of sheltering behind a complex web of maritime jurisdictions to avoid the difficult task of bringing the perpetrators to book.\\nThe alarm has not only been sounded by activists. A crackdown last year by the United States\u2019 authorities on Taiwan\u2019s distant water fleet supported their concerns about the extent of the problems.\\nIn September, the US Department of Labour added fishery products from China and Taiwan to its list of goods that it has reason to believe are associated with forced labour - an unprecedented inclusion.\\nOn December 31, the US Customs and Border Protection agency halted seafood imports from a Taiwanese vessel over suspicion of forced labour, the fourth such ban of 2020.\\nJack describes a miserable existence on board the foreign-registered Taiwanese vessel as it battled huge swells while trawling the Pacific for tuna and blue marlin.\\nHe claims the crew, from Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, were forced to work more than 20 hours a day, and were fed small, watery meals.\\nMost faced physical violence, he alleges, but the young, inexperienced Indonesian was a favourite punching bag, particularly when catches were poor.\\nHe claims one senior crew member was \u201ca furious person. He hurt people, he always cursed his people, bad mouthing us and slapping our heads for no reason at all. There were instances when he got mad and threw our laundry and toiletries in the ocean.\u201d\\nThe crew were assaulted with fishing hooks, he alleges, adding that on one occasion the Indonesian teenager was slapped hard in the face with a thick sandal.\\nArif had seemed lonely the night he died and was found lifeless when colleagues tried to wake him in the morning. They immediately went on strike, forcing the boat to dock in Fiji, but the journey to port took days and his body was stored in a freezer.\\n\u201cWhen we were about to dock, they asked all the crew to sign a waiver that said the cause of death of the Indonesian crew member was a stroke,\u201d claims Jack.\\nArif\u2019s family, who live in a remote village, were unable to be contacted. However, the details of Jack\u2019s story were corroborated by an Indonesian colleague, Stanley, who told the Telegraph that although the victim was often punished, he was generally cheerful and healthy.\\nHe claims Arif had been struck behind his ear a few hours before his death, causing him to cry out in pain. It was only the intervention of the shocked crew that prevented his body from being disposed of at sea.\\nAn autopsy in Fiji ruled that Arif died of \u201cacute pulmonary oedema with bilateral pulmonary oedema\u201d on 17 June 2019 on \u201cHigh Sea \u2013 Tahiti Waters.\u201d\\nThe Fiji police did not respond to Telegraph requests about whether there had been a further investigation into his death.\\nPearl Chen, ocean campaigner from Greenpeace East Asia, said uncertainty about the exact timing and location of Arif's death meant it was difficult to establish accountability.\\nThe lack of legal clarity in serious cases can be compounded by the frequent use of flags of convenience, when a ship is registered in another country to avoid financial charges or restrictions in its home country.\\nHowever, in March, Taiwan\u2019s fisheries agency, which has limited oversight because of the ship\u2019s foreign registration, asked prosecutors in the southern port of Kaohsiung to investigate possible violations of the Human Trafficking Prevention Act. The probe is ongoing.\\nThe Telegraph attempted to reach the boat\u2019s owners by phone and by email but received no response.\\nIn December 2019, a representative of the vessel denied to Greenpeace that crews were treated inhumanely, emphasising that working was prohibited between midnight and 5 AM, and claiming that the fishermen were paid through labour service companies in Taiwan.\\nThe representative mentioned an incident where a crewman allegedly died in his sleep.\\nHowever, the US Customs and Border Protection agency last August issued an order blocking shipments from the vessel at all American ports, following a Greenpeace report in July on the alleged abuse.\\nIt said the ban was based on information \u201cthat reasonably indicates the use of forced labour, including physical violence, debt bondage, withholding of wages, and abusive living and working conditions\u201d.\\nThe Greenpeace report \u2013\u00a0Seabound: the journey to modern slavery on the high seas \u2013 is one of several recent investigations by rights groups that has highlighted allegations of appalling working conditions in one of the world\u2019s most dangerous industries.\\nThe challenges are intensified by isolation at sea for months or even years, where it is easier for vessels to operate out of reach of the law, and by dwindling fish stocks that force the fleet further from land.\\nThe biggest complication, however, lies in the fact that the industry involves so many state actors, meaning responsibility and accountability is often unclear.\\nGreenpeace has demanded Taiwan\u2019s government ensure foreign crew on Taiwanese boats have the same rights and labour standards as their Taiwanese counterparts, including a grievance mechanism, and that it fully implement International Labour Organisation conventions on rights.\\nIt has also asked industry to do more to keep abuses out of its supply chain, including publicly disclosing its full vessel supplier list and embracing international standards like setting a maximum time at sea.\\n\u201cWe keep telling the Taiwanese government it\u2019s very important to establish high seas surveillance.We are not trying to say that all fishing vessels are bad,\u201d said Pearl Chen.\\n\u201cWe can do that with electronic observers, by asking the fishing vessels to return to port every three months and so all fishing vessels will be subject to labour inspections,\u201d she added.\\n\u201cThere are so many things that we could be doing to prevent the situation now. It\u2019s such a shame to our national reputation. We are the country that is proud of our human rights record but look at what we are doing to migrant fishers.\u201d\\nIn a statement, Taiwan\u2019s Fisheries Agency, which comes under the government\u2019s Council of Agriculture, defended its record and it said it was moving towards implementation of the ILO\u2019s Work in Fishing Convention.\\nBetween 2017 and last September, it conducted inspections on 49 per cent of Taiwan\u2019s distant water fishing vessels. The small number of owners who had violated laws received \u201cadministrative punishments, or had their cases transferred to the prosecutors\u2019 office for investigation in relation to human trafficking.\u201d\\nThe agency added it was working to enforce its clear policy against recruitment fees, the withholding of wages, and excess working hours, which should guarantee 10 hours rest a day and four days holiday every month.\\nThere would be zero tolerance of physical or verbal abuse and mechanisms were in place to report violations. Harbour inspections to monitor conditions for foreign crews had also been introduced in 2018.\\nOn the US crackdown, the agency said it \u201cwas willing to listen to suggestions from all walks of life with humility and discuss ways to improve\u201d.\\nBut while efforts were being made to close the regulatory gap between domestic and foreign workers, it insisted that \u201cmost fishing boat owners\u201d were \u201cwilling to treat foreign crews kindly\u201d.\\nNGOs had generally presented a one-sided, subjective picture that unfairly tainted the industry and did not always take into account the views of the vessel owners, it claimed.\\nPressure for action continues to mount.\\n\u201cIn recent years, the Taiwanese government has instituted legal and regulatory changes. However, NGOs find these changes to be insufficient and they continue reporting serious abuses,\u201d said a report by the Global Labour Justice-International Labour Rights Forum in December.\\n\u201cTo end forced labour in distant water fisheries, the government must abolish the discriminatory employment scheme and ensure all migrant fishers are afforded the same labour rights and protections as Taiwanese fishers,\u201d said Kimberly Rogovin, the group's\u00a0senior seafood campaign coordinator.\\n\u201cI do hope the fishing industry in Taiwan can learn to adjust to international and local regulation against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and the violation of human rights,\u201d added Lennon Ying-Dah Wong, a workers\u2019 rights activist.\\n\u201cWhat we want is merely to stop this kind of scandal and abuse, not to destroy the industry\u2026If the industry doesn't change, they might face more international sanctions.\u201d\\nHariyanto, the head of the Indonesia Migrant Workers Union, said he had heard of 21 cases,\u00a0including five from Taiwan, of modern slavery on fishing boats from 2019-2020. The case where Arif had died was \u201cone of the worst cases we found\u201d, he claimed.\\nBut perhaps nobody wants to see reform more than fishermen like Jack and Stanley.\\nStanley was left in debt to the broker who found him the job, and still has\u00a0a scar on his leg where he was struck with a fishing spear.\\nJack remains in hiding in Taiwan, where he has found construction work, but is haunted by his experience at sea.\\n\u201cI just want to be heard..to tell the whole truth about what happened in our fishing boat,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to get justice for what happened to all of us.\u201d\\nAdditional reporting: Dan Olanday in Manila\\nProtect yourself and your family by learning more about\u00a0Global Health Security", "image": [["A demonstration in Jakarta in December against modern slavery at sea", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/global-health/2021/01/13/TELEMMGLPICT000246989345_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqdTOTs03EjuZb891uz-lkHWgaQVecUj8rxrsgG1lkhqs.jpeg?imwidth=680"], ["Much of Taiwan's vast fishing fleet is staffed by Indonesian and Filipino workers", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/global-health/2021/01/13/TELEMMGLPICT000246881272_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["Fishing is a multibillion dollar industry in Taiwan and it supplies markets around the world", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/global-health/2021/01/13/TELEMMGLPICT000248426133_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqX2Twu50MDWOr9OmvKmmXP5xWLfs5mAvkbXYQqrLnBas.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["Tuna is one of the main species caught by the Taiwanese fishing fleet", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/global-health/2021/01/13/TELEMMGLPICT000248003907_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["Fishermen in the Philippines", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/global-health/2021/01/13/TELEMMGLPICT000246997507_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqERCyFNcLUIKPeqT28e10mxfhd63VCrMKZl2FrrKSrX4.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["Overfishing and rights abuses in the industry are global problems that have an impact beyond Taiwan's fleet", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/global-health/2021/01/13/TELEMMGLPICT000236865766_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq1qK9fS0WD7QU0EDCDdqwlutObuKGZ014Y3elOWbxHws.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["Fishermen display their catch in Indonesia", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/global-health/2021/01/13/TELEMMGLPICT000248059808_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=350"]], "author": ["Nicola Smith", "Lya Cai.
