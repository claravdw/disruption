The academic, who is half Brazilian and half Italian, originally moved to Yorkshire from her native Rio de Janeiro to study a PhD in English literature and as far as she knows is the only foreigner living in the village of 700 or so residents. Until now.\\nIn a few weeks, the Home Office is intending to move the first of what is expected to be 1,500 single male asylum seekers into Linton-on-Ouse, occupying a new processing centre being established on the site of a former RAF base in the village.\\nUnder the plans, which have been revealed in a shock announcement as part of the Government\u2019s proposals to also send asylum seekers to a similar facility in Rwanda, the men in Linton-on-Ouse will be housed on the former World War Two bomber base \u2013 which was also later where Prince William trained as an RAF pilot before it was closed by the Ministry of Defence in 2020.\\nThe site has been billed as \u2018Guantanamo-on-Ouse\u2019, but those sent there will be free to come and go as they please while their applications are considered. Anyone staying out beyond 10pm will be followed up with a \u2018safeguarding call\u2019, but the Home Office insists there is no curfew.\\n\u201cI can go for a walk by the river and don\u2019t meet anyone, and if I do people are friendly,\u201d says Avila. \u201cThen suddenly you are going for a walk all on your own and you [will] see a group of men. Safety is a concern.\u201d\\nIndeed, such is the apparent unsuitability of the site that the Home Office has managed to unite everyone across the political divide in opposition. Tory MP Kevin Hollinrake, who is working with local Conservative-controlled Hambleton District Council, said a legal challenge will be mounted unless the Home Secretary backs down. He has written to Boris Johnson, urging him to scrap the plan, which Hollinrake said would \u201cdevastate\u201d the village just as dramatically as if the Government constructed a reservoir on it.\\nOver recent days, Hollinrake says he has been involved in numerous discussions with Home Secretary Priti Patel (who he claims told him in a private conversation that ultimately there would be a number of similar centres established around the country).\\nHe believes the Linton-On-Ouse site was rushed through by the Government without any prior consultation so it could be unveiled as part of the \u00a3120m Rwanda deal announced last month (which is now facing its own delays after six legal challenges have been lodged). Earlier this week Boris Johnson admitted in an interview with the Yorkshire Post that the Linton-on-Ouse processing centre was \u201cpivotal\u201d to delivering the Government\u2019s Rwanda deal by ensuring there was a similar facility in place in the UK.\\nAs Hollinrake points out, the need for action is evident in the record number of asylum seekers arriving by small boats across the Channel this year (more than 7,000 between January and May \u2013 treble the 2021 rate over the same period of time). At present asylum seekers are housed in hotels while their claims are processed, which the Government admitted in February is costing \u00a34.7m every day.\\nGiven such astronomical costs, Hollinrake insists he is not against the principle of reception centres \u2013 so long as they are situated in suitable locations; and also if the people housed there are not left to simply languish.\\nWhile the vacant and Government-owned site in Linton-on-Ouse may have seemed attractive to officials in Whitehall, the problem, as residents including Avila point out, is that apart from a village shop, village hall and local primary school, there are no amenities. The bus to York (which is 10 miles away) runs just five times a day and only then if there are enough passengers on board. Otherwise there are just miles of rolling fields.\\n\u201cThe village cannot accommodate this amount of people; it\u2019s just not possible,\u201d says Avila.\\nAs a lone foreigner living in the village of overwhelmingly white residents, she insists her opposition is not about race or culture, but the fact that all of those moving into the village will be single men with nothing to do.\\nBehind the counter of the village shop, Linton Stores, 19-year-old Mya Aston voices similar concerns about the impact on the village where she grew up. \u201cA lot of people including myself will just feel unsafe,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is going to be more of them than us, and that is a bit daunting to think about.\u201d\\nWhen Hollinrake has raised his objections about the lack of facilities, he says Home Office officials pointed him to a proposed five-a-side football pitch and an on-site library. One official even highlighted 100 different types of trees on the windswept former airfield for asylum seekers to explore.\\n\u201cImagine if that was said in a public meeting,\u201d Hollinrake says. \u201cThere would be raucous laughter and anger, actually... There is this naivety at work here. You have to give people something to do.\u201d\\nCiting residents\u2019 concerns, Hollinrake says \u201ca lot of people will be afraid of going out and feel almost under house arrest, which is just unthinkable \u2013 but that is where we are.\u201d\\nResidents in Linton-on-Ouse are reportedly discussing Extinction Rebellion-style tactics in opposing the plans, including gluing themselves to fences and roads blocking the base. Many expect to see a plunge in house prices as a result of the centre. One 49-year-old resident, David (who prefers not to give his full name) moved to the village a year ago and bought his house for \u00a3500,000. \u201cI reckon it will knock at least 15 per cent off the house price if I can even sell it,\u201d he says. \u201cThis would destroy the village; absolutely destroy it.\u201d\\nA number of former service personnel who live in the village have also voiced their opposition. Among them is Paul Gerrard, a 62-year-old former corporal in the Royal Military Police.\\nHaving served in Iraq and Afghanistan, Gerrard says he has seen the plight of refugees at first-hand and has no problem with families being resettled in the village \u2013 but says the arrival of so many single men will create a \u201cpowder keg\u201d situation.\\n\u201cMy daughter is 20 and works in the corner shop and I would be concerned for her \u2013 mainly because of the mix,\u201d he says. \u201cTestosterone is going to be rife in there with nothing to do and with the facility being open, they are going to come into the village\u2026 it only needs a bad one per cent that ruins it for everybody.\u201d\\nThe chairman of Linton-on-Ouse Parish Council, Marc Goddard, insists the opposition is not about nimbyism. As he points out, residents have lived happily alongside the base for the past 85 years. \u201cAt its very height this facility had 500 personnel here, not 1,500,\u201d he says.\\nGoddard, 52, who has a nine-year-old son at the village primary school, likens what is happening in Linton-on-Ouse to the old North Yorkshire village of West End which in the 1960s was flooded to make way for a new reservoir.\\n\u201cWe are collateral damage,\u201d he says. \u201cFlooded to ensure this goes ahead.\u201d", "image": [["Monica Avila: \u2018You are going for a walk all on your own and you [will] see a group of men.

Immaculate in a Persil-white ensemble reminiscent of Joan of Arc\u2019s tabard and radiating similar levels of invincible self-belief, her menacing presence belied her diminutive stature.

But the Home Secretary plugged on, with a messianic glint in her eye, and summoned a supporting cast of wrong-uns with which the opposition were apparently in cahoots. \u201cRapists, thugs and people with NO RIGHT TO BE HERE\u201d.\\nThe Labour benches convulsed with hissing, booing, and cries of \u201cShame!\u201d \u2013 but since the Home Secretary, like a Hun or Visigoth, takes great relish in the lamentations of her enemies, it seemed only to spur her on. \u201cThey cheer on the selfish protesters who cause chaos and endanger life,\u201d she continued, triggering further gasps.\\nThe Home Secretary attempted a trolling power-play \u2013 studiously ignoring all shadow frontbenchers\u2019 pleas for an intervention, particularly her opposite number Yvette Cooper, in favour of lowly backbenchers. \u201cI will NOT give way,\u201d she smirked, as Cooper tapped the despatch box disbelievingly and Jess Phillips sniped from a sedentary position. There were echoes of Hogwarts and Professor Snape delightedly ignoring Hermione Granger\u2019s raised hand in Potions class. The Home Secretary passed from Margaret Hodge to Diana Johnson, all the while ignoring Cooper\u2019s growing exasperation. \u201cOne last time, I\u2019ll give way,\u201d said Patel, flashing an angelic grin at Jim Shannon of the DUP.\\nEventually the shadow home secretary rose to her feet, scruffy, severe and fuming. It would be hard to imagine two more polar opposites than Patel and her would-be successor. Countering Patel\u2019s sleek but fierce \u201ccat with the cream\u201d impression, Cooper, in a crumpled pink jacket that looked as if it hadn\u2019t seen an iron for some months, gave a perfect demonstration of high-minded dowdiness. As she lectured the Home Secretary for ignoring her interventions, the effect was of an overworked geography teacher after a bruising Friday afternoon encounter with the bad lads of Year 9.\\nSoon, though, the zingers were flying thick and fast \u2013 alongside a raft of shaming data; arrests down, crime up 18 per cent. \u201cCommunity penalties issued by the police in the UK were down,\u201d added Cooper, \u201cnotwithstanding the Prime Minister and his staff\u2019s valiant personal attempts to get those numbers up again\u201d.\\nReinforcements of Tory red meat arrived from the Red Wall. A gushing Jonathan Gullis thanked Patel for backing his \u201cdesecration of war memorials\u201d bill. Ashfield MP Lee Anderson, who today seemed on a mission to out-gammon the rest of them, jokingly (at least I think he was joking) called for national service with a difference \u2013 conscripting members of Extinction Rebellion for manual labour. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen these eco \u2013 whatever they are, with their little hammers smashing petrol stations up,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s a good idea that we give them bigger tools and get them to work seven days a week like the rest of us?\u201d\\nThe Home Secretary, visibly smouldering now, congratulated Anderson \u2013 someone who, \u201clike me, appreciates the value of hard work\u201d.

Labour would be foolish to entertain it", "text": "A new survey has concluded that a pre-election formal pact involving the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens would pave the way for an anti-Conservative coalition that wouldn\u2019t even have to rely on the SNP to govern. If it sounds too good to be true, then there may be a simple reason for that. But we\u2019ll come to it later.\\nFirst, we should take note of the identity of the organisation that has come to this not-particularly-surprising conclusion. Best for Britain was set up in 2017 to campaign to prevent the result of the previous year\u2019s EU referendum being honoured. Having failed in that ambition of dubious democratic credentials, it then morphed into a broader campaign to preserve and strengthen Britain\u2019s links with the EU. Its aims do not yet include rejoining the EU (and in that sentence, \u201cyet\u201d is doing a lot of heavy lifting).\\nSo it is worth asking: would Best for Britain have released with such fanfare the results of a survey which showed, contrary to their aims, that a formal pact of \u201cprogressive\u201d parties would not deliver the knock-out blow to Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives?\\nThe big news story seems to be that a Labour-led coalition would be able to govern without the help of SNP MPs, and so would not be under any obligation to concede a second independence referendum in exchange for votes in the Commons. In 2015, the prospect of a Labour government being held hostage by a large nationalist contingent helped the Conservatives destroy Ed Miliband\u2019s ambitions to lead the country.\\nSo why would Labour agree to stand aside candidates in favour of Green candidates (for that is the hope of Best for Britain) when the Greens in Scotland support independence as enthusiastically as the SNP? In fact, when Nicola Sturgeon gave ministerial jobs to two Green MSPs last year, the UK Greens welcomed the development with \u201cdelight and excitement\u201d, even as it breathlessly listed \u201cpreparing a joint bill on a new referendum on independence for Scotland\u201d as one of the main aims of their new government friends.\\nIt would be ridiculous therefore to assume that engaging with the Greens will in any way strengthen the Union.\\nMore importantly \u2013 and the reason why Best for Britain\u2019s ambitions for our electoral future are likely to be dashed \u2013 is that Labour is being invited to do two entirely contradictory things.\\nIt will, of course, as all opposition parties do, insist that it can win the next election on its own, that it is heading to majority government. But the party is also being asked to take a step that would, by definition, be an admission of defeat. \u201cYes, we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll win the next election outright, and to that end we\u2019re standing down Labour candidates across the country because they can\u2019t win.\u201d Too wordy for an election leaflet, perhaps?\\nAgreeing to Best for Britain\u2019s cynical old tactic would do nothing more than confirm in voters\u2019 minds that Labour still hasn\u2019t cracked the problem of appealing to them.\\nAnd make no mistake: the Lib Dems and the Greens, across a series of issues, are Labour\u2019s opponents. The country\u2019s sole Green MP, Caroline Lucas, was elected on the same day that the last Labour government was removed from office. Had she been elected five years earlier, there can be no doubt that she would have voted against Labour in the Commons on far more occasions than she would have supported them. While the Lib Dems established their taste for political pragmatism by their decision to usher in more than a decade of Conservative rule by agreeing to David Cameron\u2019s request for a coalition, the Greens remain unreconstructed oppositionists. The notion that they could be relied upon to support a minority Labour administration, with all the compromises and concessions such a role would entail, is fanciful to say the least.\\nA consequence for Labour of publicly stating its preference for a broad coalition with the Greens and the Lib Dems would be a free-for-all by the media. How many Green candidates will have expressed something in their social media accounts that would embarrass Starmer on the campaign trail? How many bare knuckle fights would the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, have with ostensible allies in the Green movement over the latter\u2019s ideological insistence that \u201ctrans women are women\u201d and that anyone who demurs from that assertion is transphobic?\\nWhat will Labour spokespeople say when their putative coalition partners insist that Extinction Rebellion are entirely right to prevent people going to their work or to hospital because the right to protest must always trump the right to travel? By inviting voters to support candidates who agree with that view?\\nBest for Britain have not outlined a strategic way forward for Britain\u2019s progressive parties; they have indulged in a fantasy that would result only in a chaotic (though admittedly entertaining) political circus.\\nBut the best reason to reject their approach? They offer an apparently easy path to government. Yet winning elections is not an easy task, and neither should it be. Labour can only succeed if it\u2019s willing to reform and, crucially, if it is willing to counter the demands of those who claim to be allies but who are most decidedly not.", "image": [["Lib Dem leader Ed Davey with Labour leader Keir Starmer", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2022/05/15/TELEMMGLPICT000294777510_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwSX5rhseiWKOo9p9OQ-ymek.jpeg?imwidth=680"]], "author": null, "date": "2022-05-16"}, "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2022/05/09/queen-miss-state-opening-parliament/": {"title": "The Queen to miss State Opening of Parliament for first time in nearly 60 years", "subtitle": "Her Majesty will be absent from the event for just the third time in her reign, with Prince Charles delivering the speech on her behalf", "text": "The Queen will miss the State Opening of Parliament on Tuesday for the first time in nearly 60 years, as she continues to suffer with \"episodic mobility problems\".\\nThe Prince of Wales will read the Queen\u2019s Speech on her behalf and at her request - the first time he has taken on such a major constitutional duty, Buckingham Palace announced.\\nIt is only the third time the Queen, 96, has not attended the ceremonial occasion during her reign.
