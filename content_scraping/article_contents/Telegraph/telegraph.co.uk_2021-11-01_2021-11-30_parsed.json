{"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/keira-knightley-impossible-liked-everyone/": {"title": "Keira Knightley: 'It's impossible to be liked by everyone'", "subtitle": "The 'pretty ingenue' from Love Actually on why she's no people-pleaser and choosing contentious new films over blockbusters", "text": "\u2018Do you mind if we don\u2019t turn our cameras on?\u2019 Keira Knightley\u2019s familiar, if a little more nasal than normal, voice echoes out from my laptop. \u2018It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve got Covid and I\u2019m feeling pretty rubbish\u2026\u2019\\nShe sounds deceptively perky considering that her entire family has fallen foul of the virus, finding themselves once again locked down at home in north London. Her two daughters, Edie, six, and Delilah, two, are faring better than she, in spite of her double vaccination, while her husband, the musician James Righton, is asymptomatic and \u2018being very smug about it \u2013 he is convinced it\u2019s because he\u2019s one of those cold-water swimmers and I\u2019m not\u2019.\\nIt feels rather fitting that Keira should catch Covid at the exact time she is doing press for her new film, Silent Night, a peculiarly prescient black comedy in which the parallels to the pandemic are almost uncanny. The film, written and directed by first-time feature maker, Camille Griffin, centres around a group of friends (Matthew Goode plays Keira\u2019s husband, while Peaky Blinders\u2019 Annabelle Wallis, The King\u2019s Lily-Rose Depp and Motherland\u2019s Lucy Punch also co-star) gathered together for a Christmas dinner in a country home (so far, so Love Actually, one of Keira\u2019s earliest roles back in 2003) to get rip-roaring drunk before they all take a suicide pill to avoid a certain prolonged and gruesome death by an incoming toxic gas cloud (which is where the similarities to her previous festive fare abruptly end).\\nWhile the threat in the movie comes from climate change (a topic Keira finds \u2018terrifying\u2019, having read \u2018every single climate book going\u2019 while pregnant with Delilah, before voicing a climate-crisis film for Extinction Rebellion), and not a mutating virus, the plot has food shortages, lockdowns and final goodbyes made over a Zoom call. And yet it was written way before the word \u2018Covid\u2019 joined our lexicon \u2013 filming completed just two days before the first British lockdown.\\n\u2018It was really weird,\u2019 Keira, 36, tells me of the shoot. \u2018We were making a film about an experience and then the experience suddenly started happening around us. We were filming scenes about the shops running out of food at the same time as the news was becoming full of stories that all of the toilet paper had gone. The last scenes we shot before we got shut down were our family death scenes and we were desperately trying to finish so that Lily-Rose could get back to Paris to be with her mum [Vanessa Paradis] before they closed the borders. It was incredibly strange for everyone.\u2019\\nAlongside the fact that we are still living the Covid years and the fragility of life remains a reality that many have to face, there\u2019s the worry that a comedy about the subject will not be to everybody\u2019s taste. \u2018I think it should come with a warning,\u2019 Keira agrees, \u2018because now everybody is coming to the film with a lived experience, hopefully not as horrific as this one, but it has suddenly become a lot more raw.\u2019\\nYou could argue that even without a pandemic, the film would still be incredibly divisive. It\u2019s funny and beautifully shot, but it\u2019s also very, very dark, and involves, well, parents killing their children. It is a fairly extreme example of Keira\u2019s approach to scripts these days, but very revealing of where her head is at when it comes to her career.\\nSmall budgets don\u2019t faze her \u2013 she is estimated to have made more than \u00a350 million from more than 30 movies (ranging from 2002\u2019s Bend It Like Beckham and 2003\u2019s Pirates of the Caribbean to period dramas including 2005\u2019s Pride & Prejudice and Atonement in 2007) and a lucrative deal as the face of Chanel\u2019s Coco Mademoiselle fragrance. Now, crowd-pleasing films are only interesting if they please her personally too.\\nWhen her agent sent her the Silent Night script, it came with a note that read, \u2018You might hate this.\u2019 Her interest was immediately piqued. \u2018I\u2019m not frightened of contentious,\u2019 Keira says, and she is no stranger to dividing public opinion, whether it is due to her comment that the Duchess of Cambridge shouldn\u2019t have had to pose for photographs, looking perfect, so soon after childbirth, or over her own looks, weight, voice, choice of films\u2026 the list seems endless.\\n\u2018It\u2019s impossible that you\u2019re going to be liked by everybody. That\u2019s just a task you\u2019re never going to win, but I love doing work that people will have a dialogue with, whether that\u2019s positive or negative. I think that\u2019s a very exciting place to be.\u2019\\nThe fact that Silent Night explored the maternal experience in a way Keira hadn\u2019t previously seen was another huge lure. \u2018There\u2019s this breadth of emotion that comes with motherhood that just isn\u2019t there in mass culture,\u2019 she says. \u2018You\u2019re bringing life into the world, but you are also very aware of how fragile life is because of it. And as much as you might want to protect your kids, you can\u2019t always do that. In this film, it\u2019s taken to its most extreme version, but it does tap into the dark side of the maternal psyche in a way that we never get to see.\u2019\\nMotherhood, on a personal level, informs all of Keira\u2019s film choices. Family comes first, and if the logistics don\u2019t allow them to be with her, then it\u2019s just not going to work. \u2018I had to pull out of a TV series that I really wanted to do last year,\u2019 she says, referring to Apple TV\u2019s adaptation of the Sarah Perry novel The Essex Serpent \u2013 she was later replaced by Claire Danes.\\n\u2018It was filming at that point when you couldn\u2019t travel between different parts of the UK. My youngest was one, and suddenly I might be stuck on the other side of the country and I wouldn\u2019t be able to get to her. I couldn\u2019t do that.\u2019 So she stopped. Didn\u2019t work. Holed up at home with James and the kids and stood still for the first time in a long time.\\n\u2018There\u2019s a part of me that went, this is great, maybe I should never work again,\u2019 she laughs. \u2018And another part of me that was like, whoa, I need to get back to work very quickly. But it felt lovely, because we\u2019re a family that had, up until then, moved around the whole time. I feel frazzled right now because we\u2019re trapped in the house with Covid, but if you talk to me in about two weeks\u2019 time, I\u2019ll see it with rose-tinted glasses again.\u2019\\nKeira met her husband at a mutual friend\u2019s dinner party in 2011, and they married two years later in Mazan, Provence, where she owns a farmhouse (and accompanying vineyards and olive groves). She wore a strapless Chanel couture dress (which she had worn twice before to red-carpet events). James is the cook, a \u2018very, very good one\u2019, according to Keira, who is happy to taste-test his Ottolenghi-inspired creations, and she\u2019s, well, she\u2019s the carnage. \u2018I\u2019m looking around the room I\u2019m in,\u2019 she laughs, \u2018and it\u2019s a complete tip. I think I probably made it into a tip, so can I take credit for that?\u2019\\nChildcare is a 50/50 split, which is how it has been ever since Edie was born, six years ago. When she\u2019s immersed in a role, James, 38, takes on full-time parent duty, just as Keira will when his new album is released next year. Usually it works, sometimes it doesn\u2019t, and that\u2019s when the cavalry is called in. Either her mother, the playwright Sharman Macdonald, will come up from Teddington, where she lives with Keira\u2019s father, actor Will Knightley (and where Keira and her older brother, Caleb, a composer, grew up). Or, if things are really frantic, they\u2019ll hire a nanny \u2013 a luxury she very early on found might be a necessity, thanks to an ill-advised lead role in Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin on Broadway in 2015.\\n\u2018I remember being pregnant with Edie and people going, are you sure taking on this play is a good idea?\u2019 she recalls. \u2018But I had absolutely no idea what was coming. You go, they\u2019re small, they\u2019re portable, it\u2019ll be fine! I ended up, when she was four months old, starting rehearsals for my first lead on stage in New York, playing a psychotic murderer who kills herself on stage eight times a week. It was a very difficult experience, and I wouldn\u2019t really recommend it.\u2019 She hired a maternity nurse to help with the baby at night so she could get some sleep to keep her own sanity in check.\\nNow Keira is once again heading back to the US, to take on the role of Loretta McLaughlin, the glass-ceiling-shattering reporter who broke the story of the Boston Strangler in the early 1960s. The shoot requires the family to relocate to Boston for three months. Edie has a temporary place in a local school, and James, a seasoned nomad thanks to spending his 20s on the road with his former band, Klaxons, will look after Delilah. Keira is both wildly excited about her return to work and utterly terrified.\\n\u2018The prospect feels impossible right now,\u2019 she says. \u2018I want to do it, but I\u2019ve been a full-time mum for the last 19 months. I haven\u2019t left the little one. She doesn\u2019t know life without me putting her down for a nap. Already I\u2019m going, \u201cOh my God, how are they going to cope?\u201d Now, obviously, they are going to cope fine, it\u2019s me that\u2019s going to be in pieces.\u2019\\nMcLaughlin is exactly the sort of character that Keira loves: complex, flawed, multi-layered. She says reading the script made her think of films like Alan J Pakula\u2019s All the President\u2019s Men, about Watergate.\\n\u2018It\u2019s that kind of intellect. Those are the sorts of parts I never got the opportunity to play when I was younger. In my mind, those characters traditionally would have always been played by men. To me, they are more interesting exactly because they\u2019re women.\u2019\\nShe refers to a \u2018single-mindedness\u2019 early on in her career that helped her to mostly swerve the big blockbusters she was offered, and pass on the endless roles where her sole purpose would be to look nice. \u2018There were a lot of strategic manoeuvres to get me out of being seen as the pretty ing\u00e9nue and I had a long period of having to prove myself.\u2019\\nFilms such as 2008\u2019s The Edge of Love, co-written by her mother and co-starring her friend Sienna Miller, and 2010\u2019s adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s Never Let Me Go, co-starring Carey Mulligan, moved her closer to where she wanted to be, with thought-through characters and interesting writing. But it was being cast by David Cronenberg in 2011\u2019s A Dangerous Method, an intense period study of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, co-starring Viggo Mortensen and Michael Fassbender, that felt like a game changer for her. It featured Keira, as Sabina Spielrein, being spanked by Fassbender\u2019s Jung, nudity, and submission. It wasn\u2019t the Keira Knightley people were used to seeing.\\n\u2018The idea that Cronenberg had given me something like that,\u2019 she says, \u2018that he\u2019d just gone, \u201cWell, go on, you do it,\u201d that was extraordinary to me.\u2019\\nThe quality of those quieter roles was not their sole allure, but also the prospect of removing herself from the scrutiny that films such as Pirates of the Caribbean had put her under \u2013 including tabloid headlines tearing apart everything from her acting to her looks. Paparazzi arrived on her doorstep one morning in 2003 and didn\u2019t leave her alone for five years, screaming abuse at her every time she opened her front door in order to get a photograph of her at breaking point. Their favourite insult, she says, was \u2018whore\u2019, which they would shout at her with increasing aggression throughout the day. She was barely out of her teens at the time. It was a very dark time for women in the public eye \u2013 think Sienna Miller, Amy Winehouse and Britney Spears \u2013 and by 22, the intensity of that experience for Keira led to a breakdown and, after extensive therapy, a PTSD diagnosis.\\n\u2018There is a fury in me,\u2019 she says, of the mental scars she still carries. \u2018I\u2019m furious that that is the position that we put young women in and, as the mother of two daughters, I\u2019m furious for their sake. You cannot please everybody, and yet women are still held up in order to do exactly that \u2013 that is impossible.\u2019 What would she like to see change? \u2018Young women should be seen as people, as having an intellect, and whatever they look like, whatever their bodies may be like, however attractive they are perceived to be or not, that they have worth for themselves and are not simply objectified. I\u2019ve made a lot of money out of the way I look. I choose to use that; I did, and I do, commodify myself. But we objectify young women, whether they\u2019ve made a decision to commodify themselves or not, and that makes me very angry.\u2019\\nKeira\u2019s fierce feminism started early, thanks to her mother\u2019s work ethic and politics. It\u2019s there in her film choices, from Bend It Like Beckham (girls, playing football!) to, more recently, 2018\u2019s period biopic Colette, and 2020\u2019s Misbehaviour, in which she plays an activist who disrupts the 1970 Miss World beauty pageant. She was six when she first got an acting agent, partly because she loved the idea of following in her parents\u2019 path and partly because she wanted to be \u2018useful financially\u2019 to the family. She\u2019s well aware that the drive she had won\u2019t come as naturally to her own daughters, given that their mother is worth tens of millions of pounds.\\n\u2018What I\u2019ve learnt is that they don\u2019t want to do things like tidying up or eating their vegetables,\u2019 she says, conspiratorially. \u2018And so you can instil an idea of working in payment. If all of the homework is done, the payment is watching a cartoon, but if you haven\u2019t earned it, then it doesn\u2019t happen. I\u2019m hoping that, in a very small way, that is instilling the idea that you have to work to get what you want.\u2019\\nOur time is coming to an end, but I am intrigued to know where she wants to go next. \u2018I would like to write,\u2019 she says. \u2018At the moment, my brain feels so frazzled with small children, but I would really like to see what I could do.\\n\u2018I like the unknown. That suddenly something comes out of the blue, that experience that the world is full of possibilities and you have no idea what they might be. I find that exciting.\u2019\\nAs long as her work doesn\u2019t accidentally predict any more global pandemics, I think I do too.\\n\u2018Silent Night\u2019 is released in UK cinemas and on digital platforms on Friday", "image": [["\u2018We objectify young women \u2013 whether they\u2019ve made a decision to commodify themselves or not \u2013 which makes me very angry,\u2019 says Keira Knightley", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/films/2021/11/25/26710_20200218_VSORRENTI_PORTER_KNIGHTLEY_SHOT_3_163_V4_RGB_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqyrExcyLmJ2rXkhVv_9NiEBa306WnPHVE_UdBq2uCdwc.jpg?imwidth=680"], ["\u2018This film taps into the dark side of the maternal psyche in a way that we never get to see,\u2019 says Keira of Silent Night", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/films/2021/11/25/26710_20200218_VSORRENTI_PORTER_KNIGHTLEY_SHOT_7_088_V4_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq-PSyyIpYuv3hhTxnBm0pRkgS7S-ukhk48w-_KmtyACY.jpg?imwidth=350"], ["Bend It Like Beckham, 2002", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/films/2021/11/25/B3KKR6_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZi7gvsi17RyR_riQK5LfveEF_BzZH9KgI5zMAB0l0FU.jpg?imwidth=350"], ["Keira in her new end-of-the-world dark comedy, Silent Night", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/films/2021/11/25/0592_SILENTNIGHT_040320RV_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqRo0U4xU-30oDveS4pXV-Vv4Xpit_DMGvdp2n7FDd82k.jpg?imwidth=350"], ["Love Actually, 2003", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/films/2021/11/25/BY992M_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqP4pV-m6laGcMQMbuKYgJGYOGJS8qYNz7-0VoSyoiuoY.jpg?imwidth=350"], ["Pride & Prejudice, 2005", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/films/2021/11/25/FHPHXJ_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqDGzgDyQhQusxl972-IFqFW24dU_YFKvc0zvFD3324UM.jpg?imwidth=350"], ["In Paris with husband James Righton in 2019, while pregnant with Delilah", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/films/2021/11/25/GettyImages-1146743447_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWxGSA6EqCkNPLXCjaqkxzU8FchWZRD3tSYOiRwPjWDo.jpg?imwidth=350"], ["The Edge of Love, 2008", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/films/2021/11/25/BKPGFM_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqxuFCpqIkoGDfFd5rCzvUCl4RsAJjORnPdNlOYX45nIc.jpg?imwidth=350"], ["A Dangerous Method, 2011", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/films/2021/11/25/HCBJDD_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqnjwwg6uFgt_R7Jwk0HWLoE7lTd54M51vjE_PoSGAmgY.jpg?imwidth=350"], ["Colette, 2018", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/films/2021/11/25/PPGFBC_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZgEkZX3M936N5BQK4Va8RWtT0gK_6EfZT336f62EI5U.jpg?imwidth=350"]], "author": ["Francesca Babb"], "date": "2021-11-27"}, "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/columnists/2021/11/07/hypocritical-eco-zealots-should-concentrate-solutions-not-moral/": {"title": "Hypocritical eco-zealots should concentrate on solutions, not moral point-scoring", "subtitle": "From the Greta Thunbergs of the world to Extinction Rebellion, all modern \u2018activists\u2019 want to do is virtue-signal and berate humanity", "text": "My primary school was a magnet for horrible teachers. Their goal did not seem to be the successful imparting of knowledge: on the contrary, they repeatedly opted for tactics that would stand in the way of learning, preferring to humiliate us, mock us and attack our confidence. They actually kind of seemed to hate us and we became well-versed in the psychology of people who want to punish rather than help.\\nIt is amazingly easy to spot the same psychology in the climate activism movement sweeping the world. Whether the utterly pointless beration and futile yet grandiose promises of world leaders at Cop26, or the relentless and violent obstruction of our lives practised by Extinction Rebellion and their outlandish, counterproductive offshoot Insulate Britain, the aim is to denigrate, not cure. Hypocrisy naturally accompanies all this and it was once again on full display last week as noisily green bigwigs from Boris to Jeff Bezos jetted in to Cop26 on private planes.\\nNobody wants Miami or dozens of other coastal cities sunk without a trace. If emissions remain at their current rates and the globe warms by two degrees celsius rather than 1.5C, the tipping point spelled out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), then forecasts predict that two billion people would be exposed to severe heatwaves, 420 million to extreme heatwaves and 65 million more to deadly heat. No coral reefs would remain. This is not a good picture.\\nBut one can want to avert the consequences of rapid global warming without hating humanity. The truth is \u2013 and this has been clear since that worryingly pale zealot Greta Thunberg became the Pope of environmentalism \u2013 that the climate activist brigade are far keener on hair-shirtism than on actually getting on with solving the problem. No wonder the actual Pope praised Thunberg in messianic terms as \u201cthe great witness\u201d of the Church\u2019s environmental teaching.\\nClimate activists are just that \u2013 activists, in the modern sense. This means that they don\u2019t want to avert climate change, they want to berate, denigrate and control humanity, beating their chests, showing their virtue, wailing at the moon and \u2013 crucially \u2013 ruining things for everyone else, from the commute to work to the ability to board an affordable plane to go on holiday. More fundamentally, as the birthstriker movement shows (birthstrikers believe having even just one child is morally wrong because it is bad for the environment), the new climate hairshirters seem to want to save the planet for the sake of everything on it besides human beings.\\nLook at the rhetoric of the movement. Thunberg refers to climate change not even as a \u201ccrisis\u201d but as \u201cthe climate betrayal\u201d \u2013 betrayal of the trees and animals by horrible, culpable humans. Extinction Rebellion \u2013 the global movement founded by three British eco-zealots \u2013 demands the end, or radical curtailment, of things in moral terms. \u201cWe have a moral duty to take action\u201d is its top line and its very first demand is that we \u201ctell the truth\u201d. Sound familiar? Yup. This is about owning up to your sin, if you want to avoid hell.\\nXR\u2019s second demand is to \u201creduce greenhouse emissions\u201d \u2013 fair enough \u2013 but the third, like the first, shows how little this movement is interested in practical attempts to solve the problem. Instead, it\u2019s more about chaos, lawlessness and the weakening of elected power: hence the demand for governments to be led not by their elected leaders, but by the decisions of a Handmaid\u2019s Tale-esque \u201ccitizens\u2019 assembly on climate and ecological justice\u201d. I for one certainly wouldn\u2019t want this ragbag of extremists deciding what counts as justice.\\nIndeed their real motives are all too clear in the wholesale rejection of persuasion and persistence, the bread and butter of liberal democracies. \u201cTraditional strategies like petitioning, lobbying, voting and protest have not worked due to the rooted interests of political and economic forces,\u201d they intone, concluding that all these have failed. Really? Voting has failed and is useless? This is mad and scary stuff.\\nReading the XR website, and listening to the impassioned speeches of the growing celebrity crop of global youth activists, one hears a lot about what \u201cthe science\u201d says but little about what \u201cthe science\u201d can do. Solving the climate crisis would clearly involve huge-scale reversal, requiring massive investment in human ingenuity and geo-engineering. If this bunch of crusaders were keen on solutions, we\u2019d be hearing a lot less about \u201cecological justice\u201d, the evils of voting and \u201cthe rooted interests of political and economic forces\u201d and much more about chemical scrubbers that dissolve CO and pump it underground, carbon-chomping micro-organisms, flocks of radiation-deflecting mirrors in space, CO2-sequestering power stations burning biomass, and throwing everything and more at cheap advanced nuclear fission which would enable the substitution of clean energy for fossil fuels.\\nBut we hear almost nothing about that, either from the Thunbergs of the world or \u00ad\u2013 far more worryingly \u2013 from its governments, CEOs or all the people who could actually spur investment in these things and make a real difference. Instead the pull of religious fervour, with all its rules, punishments, avowals and moral point-scoring, has once more triumphed, causing still more delay to the increasingly urgent end-goal: an actual solution.\\nYou can read Zoe Strimpel\u2019s column every Sunday", "image": [["Greta Thunberg refers to climate change not even as a \u2018crisis\u2019 but as \u2018the climate betrayal\u2019", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/columnists/2021/11/05/TELEMMGLPICT000276805772_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqP-t--XiuvYMJPd4Ncdgt2haFS7t6wUD2c5CAYw-u7FY.jpeg?imwidth=680"]], "author": null, "date": "2021-11-07"}, "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/11/03/extinction-rebellion-co-founder-claimed-climate-crisis-will/": {"title": "Extinction Rebellion founder\u2019s repugnant rant: \u2018Climate crisis will lead to gang rape\u2019", "subtitle": "Campaigners for women's safety hit out at Roger Hallam, who wrote of sex attacks on \u2018your mother, sister and girlfriend\u2019 in 2019 pamphlet", "text": "The co-founder of Extinction Rebellion claimed the climate crisis would lead to the gang rape of \"your mother, sister and girlfriend\" in a self-published pamphlet written while he was in prison in 2019.\\nRoger Hallam, who is believed to be involved in organising Insulate Britain protests, wrote that, in the aftermath of sustained climate change, \"a gang of boys will break into your house demanding food\".\\n\"They will see your mother, your sister, your girlfriend and they will gang rape her on the kitchen table,\" he wrote. \"They will force you to watch, laughing at you.
