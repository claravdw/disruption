While it insisted that rooms 33 and 34 each had a guard when The Hay Wain was targeted, it conceded that guards do patrol two rooms elsewhere.\\nIt also admitted that \u201cit was approximately three minutes before the guards started evacuating the room\u201d, but declined to explain why it took so long.\\n\u201cWe cannot comment on security arrangements or intelligence that would in itself compromise our security,\u201d it added.\\nInsiders fear that \u201cthe quality, motivation and intelligence of the warding staff has deteriorated under outsourcing\u201d.\\nJulian Spalding, a former director of museums and galleries in Glasgow, Manchester and Sheffield, told The Telegraph: \u201cIt\u2019s almost unbelievable that this could have happened. There\u2019s no way that there should be only one attendant between two rooms. It\u2019s just ridiculous. They must have attendants in every room.\u201d\\nHe dismissed the outsourcing of security as \u201ctotally wrong\u201d because the remit of museum guards goes beyond security to communicating with the public.\\n\u201cThey can\u2019t just be security staff from an outside firm,\u201d he told The Telegraph. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same business as having a security man at the entrance to a supermarket. These are world treasures. I\u2019m disgusted that the National Gallery is so irresponsible \u2013 to the paintings and the public. It\u2019s just cheapskate. It\u2019s disastrous.\u201d\\nWill Geddes, a leading security expert, was astonished that it took so long for the guards to respond.\\nHe said: \u201cWhat are their actual instructions to do in terms of not just standing there in a uniform with a badge that says \u2018security\u2019? There was no clear direction or response plan, other than to try and usher and shoo people out of the hall. Abysmal.\u201d\\nHe warned that further incidents are likely.\\nJust Stop Oil protesters also targeted the Royal Academy in London last week, glueing their hands to the frame of a copy of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s The Last Supper and spraying \u201cNo new oil\u201d across the wall below it.\\nMichael Daley, the director of ArtWatch UK, an outspoken critic of the National Gallery\u2019s conservation policy, said: \u201cGiven the astonishingly indulgent length of time protesters are given to assemble their aerosols, glues and banners before disporting themselves to cameras, it is terrifying to contemplate what else might be permitted to occur.\u201d\\nHe added: \u201cUnchecked activist assaults on works of art in museums and galleries are products of a growing institutional unfitness of purpose. Early museums comprised large collections with small dedicated professional staffs and uniformed attendants who saw that visitors could study and enjoy \u2013 but not harm \u2013 publicly displayed works.\\n\u201cIn the last half-century, uncontrolled expansionism has seen swollen and increasingly politicised staffs.\u201d\\nThe National Gallery said: \u201cSafety and security is of the highest priority.\u201d\\nSecuritas, the firm to which the National Gallery outsourced security, declined to comment.", "image": [["Just Stop Oil protesters glued their hands to the frame of John Constable\u2019s The Hay Wain last week", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2022/07/10/TELEMMGLPICT000301792629_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqL2PAfGWOBj0LpZQ6m31qI_4Xpit_DMGvdp2n7FDd82k.jpeg?imwidth=680"], ["The National Gallery declined to explain why it took so long to remove the Just Stop Oil protesters", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2022/07/10/TELEMMGLPICT000301791164_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqcM9aBJczjGu2JtrWg8AaNSz9Cmq21KUSdqMt5tijWtw.jpeg?imwidth=350"], ["Just Stop Oil protesters also targeted the Royal Academy in London last week", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2022/07/10/TELEMMGLPICT000301873625_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNpPHkRvugymKLtqq96r_VP8.jpeg?imwidth=350"]], "author": ["Dalya Alberge"], "date": "2022-07-10"}, "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/07/05/just-stop-oil-protesters-glue-artwork-londons-royal-academy/": {"title": "Just Stop Oil protesters glue themselves to The Last Supper at London\u2019s Royal Academy", "subtitle": "Campaigners want art institutions to join demonstrations calling on the Government to halt new oil and gas licences in the UK", "text": "Climate protesters have struck at a major art gallery for the fifth time in a week, gluing themselves to the frame of the copy of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s The Last Supper on Tuesday.\\nFive Just Stop Oil supporters attached themselves to the frame while the words \u201cNo New Oil\u201d were spray-painted in white paint onto the red plinth under the picture at the Royal Academy, in central London.

It is a death sentence for the nature that has directly inspired art for hundreds of thousands of years.\u201d\\nHe suggested the Government is \u201cbetraying the younger generations and those in the global south who are facing the worst impacts\u201d of climate change.\\nJust Stop Oil later named some of the protesters as Lucy Porter, 47, a former primary teacher from Leeds, Jessica Agar, a 21-year-old art student from Hereford, and Tristan Strange, a 40-year-old community organiser from Swindon.\\nIn a statement, Ms Porter said: \u201cMy job as a teacher was to encourage my students to take inspiration from the great works of art housed by institutions like the Royal Academy.\\n\u201cHow can our Government expect young people to respect culture when they are encouraging new oil and gas projects that will be our children\u2019s death sentence?\u201d\\nMs Agar said: \u201cAs an art student, I deeply respect and value the artworks themselves, but I also value the power that art has to change the world. It\u2019s that power I speak to today.\\n\u201cArtists and galleries are failing to meaningfully take action against the climate emergency. No painting is worth more than my six-month old nephew\u2019s life. No sculpture can feed babies starving because extreme heat killed food crops.\u201d\\nMr Strange said: \u201cTime is running out to change course or prepare for disaster, and the message is not reaching the public or our politicians. We must stop new oil and gas immediately.\\n\u201cDa Vinci said that art is the queen of all sciences, communicating knowledge to all the generations of the world.

Nevertheless, Mercedes have certainly had worse opening days.\\n\"It has been a good day,\" Hamilton told Sky Sports F1 after second practice.\\n\"Feeling pretty good. It's bouncing still, not necessarily in a straight line but through the corners it's pretty harsh. Not physically harsh but in the car. It feels like a small step forward.\"\\n\"The upgrades were for downforce. It's difficult to feel it because it's two massively different tracks [Canada and Silverstone]. It's much smoother this track, which is a bit more like Barcelona.\"\\n\"It is still hair-raising and epic to drive,\" the Briton said of the challenges of Silverstone in the new regulation cars.\\n\"Our long run pace isn't as good as the other guys but it isn't miles off. We've definitely made an improvement. I am sure overnight we can work and improve the car a little bit more.\"\\nEarlier in the afternoon, Alfa Romeo\u2019s Valtteri Bottas was fastest in a first practice session that was disrupted as rain fell heavily before the session\u2019s start and intermittently throughout. Only\u00a0 Hamilton registered a lap count in the double figures.\\nBy the time track conditions were fit for slick tyres there were only a few minutes remaining on the clock. The session was then brought to a premature close as Lance Stroll spun his Aston Martin at Copse, bringing out a red flag.\\nHeading into the 10th race of the season in Great Britain, defending champion Max Verstappen comfortably leads the standings by 46 points over Perez and by 49 points over Leclerc.\\nWith four races in the next five weeks before Formula One\u2019s summer hiatus, Leclerc and Ferrari need to start to claw back some of that lead this weekend or face another season without seriously competing for titles.\\nI'll be back tomorrow for qualifying, which begins at 3pm BST. What chance of Hamilton in the top three? Or evem on the front row? A repeat of that top three for qualifying would be something, wouldn't it?\\nHard to know what to make of that. A second (exactly) separates the top 10 and then it's 0.667s between 10th and 19th with Latifi 2.384s off the pace in last. It could leave us with a few surprises tomorrow. It's all to play for, with a fair few teams in the mix. Strange day for Red Bull, they look to be behind Ferrari and maybe will have Mercedes to contend with. But, then again, maybe not.\\nThat's it for the running today. I'll have a full order coming up shortly. Encouragement for Mercedes and McLaren? Possibly...\\nHis qualifying simulation wasn't brilliant though, again, hard to really know at this point.\\nFerrari, Mercedes, McLaren, Red Bull, Alpine and Aston Martin. AlphaTauri not doing much today, nor Haas. Those two teams make\u00a0up four of the bottom five.\\nHard to know what to make of them. You wouldn't expect Mercedes and McLaren to be quite that quick, but this is the first session of dry running, and with the new parts that many teams have perhaps the set-ups aren't all that dialled in. Perez languishing eight-tenths off the pace, too.\\nHe says he didn't go off or run wide, so a problem with the floor itself, then.\\n12 minutes remain.\\nIt's fine, but is slower than Norris by a small margin and a couple of tenths off\u00a0 Sainz.\\nHamilton, meanwhile, has gone second with a fine lap, 0.163s off Sainz, who remains quickest.\\nFourth from the Spaniard, 0.753s off Sainz's best time.\\nTime to see what Verstappen and Hamilton have on the soft tyres.\\nSainz leads the way with a 1:28.942. Leclerc not looking like beating that as it stands, down after two sectors. He finishes the lap nearly half a second down and in third, behind Lando Norris. Norris's lap is looking a bit... well, could be a glory run? He's eight-tenths quicker than team-mate Ricciardo.\\nHamilton has not yet come out for a run on the soft tyres. Seems like his car is receiving some attention on the suspension. He earlier complained of bouncing in the high-speed. They wouldn't have got much of a sense of that in the first session.\\nHe has just gone quickest by a tenth over Norris, but says he lost a lot of time in the high speed with bouncing. Ferrari have suffered with that this season, though it doesn't appear to have cost them as much lap time as teams like Mercedes.\\nHis lap of 1:29.118 on the soft tyres is 0.344s quicker than Leclerc. Runs on the soft tyres only just beginning so let's look at where Norris ends up. Russell's lap on the softs is still nearly seven-tenths off the McLaren driver, though...\\nBut he is on a quick lap on the soft tyres. How quick is it? It's quick enough for seventh but a couple of tenths off Hamilton in fifth.\\n38 mins remain.\\nHe improves to a 1:29.462 to move 0.423s ahead of Verstappen. Sainz on a good lap too but he can't beat Leclerc, though only 0.081s behind his team-mate.\\nBouncing a lot in the high speed.\\nHe's on the medium tyres. Quite a lot of high-speed at this track.\\nLeclerc leads the way with a 1:29.639, 0.323s ahead of his team-mate and around 0.849s of Verstappen. Or he was, until Verstappen has just gone faster still but only enough for second. 0.246s off Leclerc.\\n&nbsp;The conditions are a lot better in this session. Not exactly a brilliant day, but moderately sunny. It wouldn't ruin your BBQ, let's put it that way.\\nIt's very windy out there.\\nHe locked up into turn three.\u00a0 He also says he has some vibrations, which he complained of only a few minutes ago.\\nNorris runs wide on the exit of turn one. Russell gets blocked by an AlphaTauri. He says it was dangerous but I am not sure about that. Annoying, yes.\\nGets wide on the kerbs in the first sector. On the medium tyres and looking quick. He crosses the line with a 1:31.438.\\nA real mixture of tyre types out there. And every driver on the track. That's good to see.\\nWe should see a fair bit of running this session after the rain-affected first session.\\nBy Tom Morgan at Silverstone\\nPolice have warned of \"credible intelligence\" that protesters are considering an \"extremely dangerous\" invasion of the Silverstone track at the British Grand Prix on Sunday.\\nOfficers declined to state who was behind the potential stunt, but an appeal comes after four \u00a0Extinction Rebellion environmental demonstrators were arrested at the circuit in 2020.\\nMore than 400,000 people are attending the Northamptonshire circuit over three days for the fastest-selling GP in Silverstone's history. Police went public with their concerns as first practice took place on Friday.\\nChief Inspector Tom Thompson, the Northamptonshire police event commander, said: \u201cWe have received credible intelligence that a group of protestors are planning to disrupt the event and possibly invade the track on race day,\u201d Chief Inspector Thompson said.\\n\u201cFirst of all, I want to appeal directly to this group of people and strongly urge you to not put yourselves, the drivers, as well as the many marshals, volunteers and members of the public, at risk. Going onto a live racetrack is extremely dangerous \u2013 if you go ahead with this reckless plan you are jeopardising lives.\\n\u201cProtesting is of course everyone\u2019s human right in this country and we are more than happy to speak with you to help you facilitate a peaceful protest at the circuit, we just please ask that you do not create a situation that puts lives in danger.\u201d\\nThe FIA declined to comment on what protests it was expecting but police added that they \"have planned an extremely wide-ranging policing operation which covers contingencies such as these and as such, extra resources will be in place throughout the race weekend should anyone ignore these warnings and try to disrupt the event\".\\nIn 2020, a pink banner from Extinction Rebellion was seen being unfurled over sponsorship hoardings at Club Corner - the last turn. Photographs later showed the protestors, dressed in black overalls and wearing T-shirts and masks with the group's logo, being led away from the side of the circuit.\\nSilverstone managing director Stuart Pringle, said: \"We work closely with Northamptonshire Police and the emergency service agencies to put plans and procedures in place to ensure we are fully prepared to handle such situations.\" He urged fans at Silverstone \"to act as our eyes and ears and report anything suspicious to a steward\".\\nSecond practice gets under way in a little over 30 minutes. It should be a much more interesting session than the first one as it has stopped raining and it is definitely conditions for dry tyres.\\nIs it effective? Is it good? I am not sure. Might be good if not overused.\\n&nbsp;I'll be back for the build-up to second practice in just over an hour or so.\\nNobody else set a lap time bar those 10 drivers. Not the best session to kick things off... hopefully more this afternoon.\\nHamilton had just gone into second with his second hot lap on the soft tyres, 0.5s off Bottas. Almost everyone had switched to the soft tyres but most had to abort their final laps due to the red flag.\\nIt's Lance Stroll in the wall at Copse, I think., The session will not be resumed, but there was barely a minute left, anyway. Lost it at the apex and then went backwards into the gravel and then frontwards into the wall. Not an enormous amount of damage. Surprised someone else didn't spin before him.\\nSoft tyres giving him back about 2.5s in the final sector, then. He ends up 2.549s off Bottas's quickest lap time. A handful of cars out there now in the final minutes. Including Verstappen.\\nThe middle sector is quite wet, though. And that leaves him nearly five seconds off Bottas's new quickest time (1:42.249) with one sector to go...\\nHamilton comes into the pits and goes out on a new set of soft tyres... brave.\\nFive minutes remain.\\nHe is faster than the fastest lap so far today after one sector...\\nBut is three seconds behind after two...\\nLooks like it has stopped raining with the sun out. Only nine minutes remain as Hamilton crosses the line to go seventh fastest, 6.5s off the pace.\\nIt's Lewis Hamilton. Out on the intermediates for his fourth lap. Will he set a time now?\\nLewis Hamilton removed his nose stud ahead of\u00a0the first practice session for the British Grand Prix, in a move specifically designed to avoid a ban or a fine by the FIA.\\nThe seven-time world champion\u00a0has been engaged in a lengthy stand-off with Formula One\u2019s governing body, who have taken an uncompromising stance on drivers wearing jewellery in their cars, claiming that it can interfere with their flameproof overalls and consequently become a fire hazard.\\nRead more from Oliver Brown here.\\nSorry, absolutely nothing to report on currently. Sometimes races are more interesting when we get limited/wet running... so let's hope for that here.\\nIn fact it is probably getting a bit heavier now.\u00a0 Not too optimistic of much more significant running. Lewis Hamilton has, however, just gone over to the pit wall to wave to the fans.\\n&nbsp;A grand total of zero cars on the track...\\nCan't say this is the most gripping session I have ever seen. That's what happens when it rains, though. Not sure we will get anyone out on dry tyres before the session ends.\\n&nbsp;Most drivers have completed just one or two laps. Or, rather, one or three. Only Sainz and Bottas with more than four.\\nAs the sun comes out. He leads his teammate Leclerc by 0.834s. Every driver has at least ventured onto track but only eight lap times so far.\\n\"It's getting dry very quickly now so I will box,\" he says.\\nNot sure that it is really relevant to post an order given the un-representativeness of the times and conditions. But it's Leclerc from Stroll, Tsunoda, and then Vettel. 15 seconds separates the top four...\\nAlbon was not on the softs. It would have been asking for trouble. Leclerc still the only driver to have set a lap time. Everyone else just doing in and out laps so far. It has, however, brightened up.\\nIt was this piece of jewellery that has been the subject of a clampdown earlier in the season, although he was given a few races' grace until the new rule would be enforced.\\nOut comes Alonso on intermediates. Looks like Albon has gone out on the softs, but that could be an error on the riming screen.\\nIt's wettest at the start of the lap it appears. Copse then Maggots/Becketts/Chapel are fairly dry.\u00a0Only Leclerc out on track at the moment and the only driver to have set a time so far: a 1:44.769.\\nIt's quite wet out there at the moment and Russell is told that it is expected to get wetter. Every driver of the four (two Mercedes and two Ferraris) are on the intermediate tyres.\\nOne hour... and there's a bit of rain about. Not ideal for the teams. Russell is out early and gets a good reception for it.\\n&nbsp;Confirmed: It is now raining at (some of) the track.\\nOkay. I think it looks like there's a bit about tomorrow, too. Just under 10 minutes to go until the session starts.\\nWell, it's cloudy everywhere. Dark clouds in the distance. Are they heading to the circuit? A little different to last year when it was a scorcher.\\nNotable that Nelson Piquet is the father of Verstappen's girlfriend, Kelly.\\n&nbsp;Hopefully not as it tends to lead to little running.\\nSebastian Vettel is going to do a demonstration run in Nigel Mansell's (iconic) Williams FW14B. It's the car he owns himself, which is pretty cool.\\nFerrari having such a nightmare recently that Mercedes look quite tidy by comparison.\\n&nbsp;Haas have failed to deliver on their promise and some excellent qualifying positions. Will that change here?\\nI am not sure I have the word for it.\\nBring back classic-looking helmets, I say.\\nThe racism row\u00a0engulfing Nelson Piquet and Formula One\u00a0escalated on Friday as it emerged he had gone on to make even more offensive comments about Lewis Hamilton on a podcast.\\nAs Hamilton called for action against \"older voices\" with offensive views, reports in Brazil claimed Piquet called the Briton a \"neguinho\" a third time and said he was being \"f----- in the a--\".\\nRead the full piece here from Tom Morgan.\\nAnd welcome to our live coverage for first and second practice at the 2022 British Grand Prix at Silverstone. This is normally one of the races of the year on and excellent and challenging track for both the drivers and hopefully also it will be a test of the new regulation cars. It is, however, a shame that little of the pre-race talk at such an historic track like this has been about actual on-track action.\\nThe narrative, unfortunately, has been dominated by comments that Nelson Piquet made about Lewis Hamilton at the end of last year, which have resurfaced. Without going into too much detail, you can read the latest on that sorry saga here. The entirety of F1 - or pretty much - has rallied around and supported Hamilton, which is only right. And Piquet has been banned from the paddock for his comments.\\nBack to the on-track stuff and this race does feel like a pivotal one for the championship. It seems a long time ago that two DNFs put Max Verstappen in a difficult position in the championship, trailing Ferrari's Charles Leclerc by more than 40 points. Since Melbourne, though (Leclerc's last win), Ferrari have faltered at nearly every opportunity. They have been quick in qualifying but reliability issues and driver mistakes have meant that Leclerc now has a 40-odd point gap to Verstappen, and with Red Bull the faster car.\\nYes, it is a long season and there are many races still to go. Red Bull have also had some reliability issues of their own, but with four races in the next five weeks before the summer break, July is either going to be the month where Ferrari fell completely out of contention, or where they got themselves back into it. Let's hope for the latter.\\nThere's a bit of hope around a Mercedes revival, too, which would be nice with two British drivers. I can't see them challenging for victory but podiums could be a possibility. Hopefully the smoother circuit will lessen their bouncing issues.\\nFirst practice starts at 1pm BST with second practice at 4pm, which feels like an extremely late time to be finishing on a Friday to me. But that is where we are.", "image": [["Lewis Hamilton finished second quickest in a promising day for Mercedes", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/formula-1/2022/07/01/TELEMMGLPICT000301507821_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6844extr6dIv-d8O8PIpPgCEHDW0sRYS-ijm8he9f1E.jpeg?imwidth=680"]], "author": ["Luke Slater"], "date": "2022-07-01"}, "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/07/04/just-stop-oil-protesters-john-constable-painting-hay-wain/": {"title": "Constable masterpiece The Hay Wain damaged in Just Stop Oil protest", "subtitle": "Activists attach their own image of \u2018apocalyptic vision of the future\u2019 to famous painting at London\u2019s National Gallery", "text": "The Hay Wain suffered minor damage on Monday when environmental activists attached their \u201capocalyptic vision of the future\u201d to the John Constable masterpiece.\\nTwo Just Stop Oil protesters carried out the protest at the National Gallery yesterday before gluing themselves to the frame of the 200-year-old artwork.\\nExperts found minor damage to the frame and the varnish covering the painting after taking it down for examination.

I groaned at both the student vibe of the activism, and the group\u2019s dogmatic mantra \u2013 one of the protesters even said galleries should close and join the call on the Government to stop all gas and oil projects immediately.\\nThis is not effective activism: Just Stop Oil\u2019s blunt and unyielding approach won\u2019t win over hearts and minds. Great art, however, can. If you look through history, it is clear that supreme artistic talent can affect people in unusual ways, display a unique vision and give insights beyond more obvious actions and words. Protests against Hitler were hardly unknown, but the work of the German artist John Heartfield so unnerved the Nazis in the lead up to the Second World War that he ended up as No 5 on the Gestapo\u2019s most wanted list. Heartfield\u2019s collection of photomontages satirising the F\u00fchrer and Nazi imagery did more than subvert a dictatorship, his powerful pastiches undermined them with humour and struck a nerve in a man who, prior to trying to exterminate a whole race, peddled his own very bad art among dealers in Vienna.\\nSometimes, great art can even effect change. Paula Rego\u2019s series, entitled Abortion, was created in a fearless blaze of passion in 1998, the year of a referendum on abortion in her native Portugal. Her series of 10 paintings did not set out to shock with blood and gore but drew you into her subjects (depicted in backstreet clinics) through physicality and psychological acuity. Many say they proved crucial in Portugal\u2019s second vote, nine years later (which legalised abortion up to 10 weeks).\\nPicasso\u2019s Guernica, supremely strange and hard to avert your eyes from, brought the Spanish Civil War to worldwide attention and even funded war relief when the work went on tour. The odd thing about Guernica, to my mind, is that it acts as a powerful piece of polemic despite it being hard to decipher. I remember when I first saw it, staring for more than 10 minutes, slightly baffled but also utterly moved. Sometimes, the most effective work is that which allows you, as a viewer, to draw your own conclusions.\\nThat is the problem with a lot of contemporary art when it tries to work as activism. It hammers you over the head, like being hectored by the office bore at the Christmas party. There is nothing left for the viewer to challenge or question, as anyone who has attended the Royal Academy\u2019s current Summer Exhibition will testify. The supposedly \u201capocalyptic\u201d nature of this year\u2019s drearfest (theme: \u201cClimate\u201d) has an exhaustive, earnest quality, and was described by Alastair Sooke, The Telegraph\u2019s chief art critic, as \u201cconventional as a summer fete\u201d. Nothing within Burlington House would convince you to reduce your carbon footprint, or indeed superglue yourself to a masterpiece.\\nOne member of Just Stop Oil, Emily Brocklebank, said that contemporary artists focus on the wrong things. But if she stopped to look around her she would see that eco-art is everywhere, surely then dovetailing to an extent with her own views. Not everything, thankfully, is as banal as what is on display at the Royal Academy.\\nAmerican-Chinese conceptual artist Mel Chin\u2019s ongoing project Revival Field, which tries to reclaim soil from polluted areas and use it as art, sounds dreadful, but is actually incredibly beautiful and affecting. And, while he has his critics, I often love the slick showmanship of Olafur Eliasson, whose giant chunks of icebergs (hacked from the Norwegian fjords) was a decisive moment in the history of interventionist art.\\nUnfortunately, a talented artist\u2019s activism is now very likely to be misinterpreted in our irony-free age. Remember the furore in 2020 over Philip Guston, whose figures of Ku Klux Klan members in ridiculous poses caused such a stink that a major exhibition was postponed? It\u2019s a sad fact that the subtleties of an artist such as Guston could now be lost, that a younger generation, more likely to take everything at face value, might engage more with the overtly interventionist tactics of groups such as Just Stop Oil.\\nBut is there ever a legitimate case for actual artistic vandalism in the name of a cause? I would argue, yes, very occasionally. Perhaps the most famous defacement in history is the slashing of Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s Rokeby Venus at the National Gallery in 1914, by suffragette Mary Richardson. Given the obvious importance of universal suffrage and the suffering which many women of Richardson\u2019s generation were prepared to undertake, the attack on the painting feels justified and the bleatings of Just Stop Oil rather hollow.\\nPerhaps you couldn\u2019t expect these activists to appreciate the power of art, but the fact is that entering into the space of a great painter or sculptor or conceptual artist allows us to question both our prejudices and our allegiances. That\u2019s far more effective than anything that involves a tube of superglue.", "image": [["Missing the point: Just Stop Oil members cover Constable\u2019s The Hay Wain", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/art/2022/07/06/TELEMMGLPICT000301791216_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqRo0U4xU-30oDveS4pXV-Vv4Xpit_DMGvdp2n7FDd82k.jpeg?imwidth=680"], ["A sketch for one of Paula Rego\u2019s legislation-changing Abortion pictures", "www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/art/2022/07/06/TELEMMGLPICT000302006787_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq4P52MmS8-_tbGo4HtDarsU0G3PBde1wRVgoUU2qKiUs.jpeg?imwidth=350"]], "author": null, "date": "2022-07-07"}, "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/columnists/2022/07/09/how-elon-musk-can-save-britain/": {"title": "How Elon Musk can save Britain", "subtitle": "Our birth rate is plummeting \u2013 while Mr Musk\u2019s is soaring.

As we read earlier in the week, a new study says Britain is likely to grow poorer \u2013 because the rich and well-educated aren\u2019t having enough children.\\nClearly there is only one solution. Without delay, the Government must invite Mr Musk to come to Britain and impregnate as many of us as possible. Being rich, well-educated and mind-bogglingly fertile, he should solve our problems in no time.

Hansard, after all, is a vital historical record \u2013 and its staff have a duty to ensure that future generations understand what our MPs said.\\nIf it weren\u2019t for Hansard, after all, no one would have a clue what John Prescott was on about.\\nBack when his Lordship was deputy prime minister, the Hansard crew were constantly having to untangle his pronouncements to the Commons. At times this task was simple enough. They had no problem translating such Prescottisms as \u201cAt this present in time\u201d and \u201cLet me say quite clear\u201d. And when, in 2004, he pledged to \u201celiminate the homeless\u201d, they left the line as it was. Well, you knew what he meant.\\nSome days, however, they must have felt as if they were working not in the House of Commons but at Bletchley Park. During a debate over strike action by firemen in 2002, the Guardian\u2019s Simon Hoggart recorded Mr Prescott as saying: \u201cI\u2019ve already mentioned quite frankly that there may be a 100, previously, then it was down to one yesterday, now it\u2019s no. Not. And I think we should welcome that as a fact.\u201d Hansard\u2019s translation ran as follows. \u201cAs I have already said, 100 drivers did not turn up during the previous strike, but that number went down to one yesterday, and it is now none. That should be welcomed.\u201d\\nEven trickier to unpick was a jibe Mr Prescott made in 2007 about William Hague, alluding to the sizeable fees the former Tory leader charged for speaking engagements. \u201cI notice that he wasn\u2019t in the first session,\u201d boomed Mr Prescott. \u201cIs that his fee to be in the first session was too expensive for this one? Or is the charging for Tory overtime rates at your speaking rates is too much money?\u201d\\nHansard did its best. In the end it went with: \u201cWas his fee for the first session too expensive, or, given his rates for speaking, is the overtime that would be charged too much money for the Tory party?\u201d\\nWhat an arduous job these poor stenographers have. They deserve Hague-sized fees themselves.\\nIn an attempt to shock the world into action, eco-activists from Just Stop Oil overlaid Constable\u2019s The Hay Wain with a \u201cdystopian\u201d pastiche. The aim, said a spokesman, was to show \u201chow oil will destroy our countryside. The river has gone, replaced by a road. Planes fill the sky\u2026\u201d\\nI thought they were trying to make us fear for the future. But if planes are going to fill the sky, the future sounds like a significant improvement on the present. You\u2019re lucky to get in the air at all these days.\\nIn fact, since so few planes are flying, more rail strikes are imminent and hardly anyone can afford to fill their car with petrol, I don\u2019t know what Just Stop Oil are complaining about.
