These are just the locations he posted about but they alone mean he must have travelled at least 1,500 miles within Canada too on top of his flights - taking the entire distance travelled over 10,000 miles.\\nAnd regularly while he was enjoying this trip of a lifetime, despite its negative effects on the environment, Ford - apparently oblivious to the contradiction - was also regularly posting content promoting Extinction Rebellion and its twin pressure group Insulate Britain.\\nHe took this trip despite research published just weeks before he embarked showing that just a single long-haul flight generates more carbon emissions than an average person in many poorer countries consumes in a whole year.\\nHe finally returned to the UK in January 2020 but had only been back a matter of days when he began planning his next international trip - again apparently oblivious to the personal contributions to global warming this would inevitably cause.\\nOn January 15 he was asking advice about what van to buy for his next trip. It's not clear what he went on to spend but by August he had clearly not only bought a van but driven it many thousands of miles around continental Europe.\\nIn an album he entitled 'From Whittlesford to Warsaw' on August 29 he posted 25 pictures showing himself and a female companion cavorting around a series of exotic locations during the previous weeks visibly enjoying themselves at each.\\nThe direct trip between the two places would involve a round trip of well over 1,500 miles driving - and it's plain that Ford took many pleasure-driven deviations. This means he would have generated at least 380kilos of carbon.\\nPerhaps he used a modern low-emission vehicle? No - quite the contrary. The same 'lovely little van' he used for the trip, a diesel-powered Citroen, he then offered for sale in January this year by which - no doubt boosted by Ford's penchant for globe-trotting - it had an astonishing 145,000 miles on the clock.\\nOnce back in England Ford then saw no contradiction in stopping other motorists - most of whom would have been driving much shorter distances with more compelling reasons than he just had - being able to move around.", "image": [["Eco-zealots from Just Stop Oil have managed to climb on top of a loading bay at Kingsbury Terminal in Warwickshire after gaining access to the facility in the early hours of this morning", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/15/14/56651731-10721259-Eco_zealots_from_Just_Stop_Oil_have_managed_to_climb_on_top_of_a-m-79_1650028443159.jpg"], ["Tempers have today flared between lorry drivers and eco-zealots blocking an oil terminal, with a lorry driver seen appearing to yank an activist off a tanker and to the ground", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/15/08/56643073-0-image-a-110_1650008098387.jpg"], ["Dramatic pictures show the moment the activist hits the concrete after appearing to be grabbed by the irate lorry driver during a protest outside the Grays Inter Terminals in Thurrock, Essex this morning", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/15/08/56642243-10721259-image-a-111_1650008107864.jpg"], ["An activist from Just Stop Oil is carried away by police officers after blocking an entrance to a fuel terminal during a protest in Grays, Essex", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/15/14/56642255-10721259-An_activist_from_Just_Stop_Oil_is_carried_away_by_police_officer-a-53_1650030853899.jpg"], ["Police officers stand nearby as activists from Just Stop Oil sit in front and on top of a fuel tanker during a protest at a roundabout in Grays, Essex", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/15/08/56642229-10721259-image-a-128_1650008529411.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/15/09/56643919-0-image-a-158_1650010314664.jpg"], ["Police officers stand nearby as activists from Just Stop Oil sit on top of a fuel tanker during a protest at a roundabout in Grays, Essex", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/15/07/56642223-10721259-image-a-72_1650005059677.jpg"], ["Activists from the Just Stop Oil campaign group stand on top of an oil tanker at Stoneness Roundabout in Grays Essex", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/15/07/56642239-10721259-image-a-78_1650005447357.jpg"], ["Protestors holding a banner saying 'Just Stop Oil' as they sit on top of a fuel tanker during a protest in Grays, Essex today", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/15/11/56646879-10721259-image-a-42_1650017378942.jpg"], ["A police officer walks nearby as activists from Just Stop Oil sit on top of a fuel tanker during a protest in Grays, Essex", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/15/11/56646881-10721259-image-a-27_1650017213844.jpg"], ["Police use cranes to remove Just Stop Oil activists sitting on top of a fuel tanker in Grays, Essex, today", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/15/11/56646875-10721259-image-a-44_1650017393872.jpg"], ["Police gather as activists from Just Stop Oil blocks an entrance to a fuel terminal during a protest in Grays, Essex", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/15/11/56646885-10721259-image-a-28_1650017230897.jpg"], ["Meanwhile, video posted on the group's Twitter page shows one activist 'tanker surfing' -

Applications for the role, with a salary of\u00a0\u00a3292,938, must be handed in by May 4.", "text": "The job advert for the next Metropolitan Police Commissioner has gone live, and the successful candidate will be tasked with making the force 'demonstrably more professional'.\\nScotland Yard are giving high-ranking officers from across the country, and possibly abroad, three weeks to submit their applications before being whittled down to find the next boss for\u00a046,000 officers and staff.\\nMet chief Dame Cressida Dick left the job last week after five years, with her deputy Sir Stephen House temporarily taking the reins until a permanent successor is appointed in the summer.\\nPotential candidates for the post include former director general of the National Crime Agency Dame Lynne Owens and current Met Assistant Commissioner Matt Jukes.\\nThe force has been mired in a series of incidents that have damaged public confidence, including deeply offensive messages shared by a team based at Charing Cross station and the\u00a0strip-search of a black schoolgirl.\\nDame Cressida\u00a0admitted herself that Sarah Everard's rape and murder by then-serving police officer Wayne Couzens had brought 'shame' on the force and damaged public confidence in police.\\nBritain's most senior officer also failed to get a grip on a culture of racism, sexism and bullying that has haunted Scotland Yard for years.\\nThe\u00a0advert for her replacement states that it has become 'evident that significant and sustained improvements need to be made within the MPS to restore public confidence and legitimacy in the largest police force in the UK.'\\nIn continues: 'This will require inspirational leadership to deliver a demonstrably more professional police force, that better reflects the diversity of London itself.'\\nThe Met has also been heavily criticised by watchdogs the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) in recent months.\\nHMICFRS found that the Met's approach to tackling corruption was not fit for purpose, and described storage of evidence by some teams as 'dire' with drugs, jewellery and money going missing and guns not properly secured.\\nWhile the IOPC took the unusual step of publishing disturbing messages shared by the Charing Cross team - despite the fact that much of the content was too offensive to print in mainstream news coverage - as it detailed the 'disgraceful' behaviour of officers based in a now disbanded Westminster team between 2016 and 2018.\\nIOPC regional director Sal Naseem said that the issues raised were 'not isolated or historic'.\\nTwo inquiries, set up in the wake of the murder of Miss Everard, are being held into culture at the Met - an internally-commissioned probe led by Baroness Louise Casey, and a Home Office commissioned inquiry by Dame Elish Angiolini.\\n'You will lead the service through significant change, role-modelling credible, visible and empowering leadership to address concerns around police conduct and tackling institutional culture.\\n'The successful candidate will be responsible for re-establishing trust and confidence in policing amongst everyone living in London, particularly women and girls and those from Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities.'\\nThe role, considered the most senior police rank in the country, has a salary of \u00a3292,938 - almost twice the size of the Prime Minister's packpacket.\\nApplicants from UK forces must have served at the rank of constable in a UK police force and have held the rank of Assistant Chief Constable, Commander, or higher.\\nApplications for the position must be submitted by May 4 with no late entrees.\\nCandidates will then face tests and exercises before going in front of a selection panel led by\u00a0Home Office Permanent Secretary Matthew Rycroft.\\nThe successful candidate will receive a five-year fixed term appointment, although this can be extended by three years.\\nDame Cressida left the police chief role five years to the day that she started, while of her predecessors were ousted before finishing their initial appointment.\\nNeil Basu: Anti-terror chief who called for journalists to be prosecuted after publishing leaked cables criticising Trump\\nNeil Basu is the Met's former head of counter-terrorism and the most senior serving British officer of Asian heritage.\\nHe also served as the assistant commissioner for specialist operations until September 2021, which included responsibilities around national security, and had originally been tipped for the top job in 2017 before losing out to Dame Cressida.\\nIn February this year, he called for laws in the Equality Act 2010 that restrict positive discriminations to be relaxed in order to boost the number of BAME recruits. He was immediately shot down by policing minister Kit Malthouse, while Home Secretary Priti Patel was also said to be against the idea.\\nMr Basu faced fresh accusations of meddling in politics in July 2019, when he threatened to prosecute journalists for publishing leaked cables from Britain's ambassador to the US, Sir Kim Darroch.\\nFormer Tory cabinet minister David Davis said the intervention 'strayed well beyond his brief', and represented an attack on the free Press.\\n\\nA 2019 profile of Basu in the Mail On Sunday described him as well-liked within the force and by intelligence officials at MI5. But he has attracted criticism for some of his operational decisions, most notably as head of Operations Weeting, Elveden and Tuleta.\\nThe three inquiries into phone hacking, computer hacking and alleged payments to police officers by newspapers cost around \u00a319.5million and were criticised for criminalising journalists.\\nHe became a Met police officer in 1992, serving first as a beat bobby in Battersea, South London, then swiftly moving through the ranks as a borough commander in Barnet, North London, and a Commander of South London in 2012.\\nAndy Cooke: Former Merseyside chief who insists even violent criminals are 'not inherently bad people'\\nWhile head of Merseyside Police, Andy Cooke sparked anger when\u00a0he said even violent criminals are 'not inherently bad people' and he'd rather pump billions into cutting poverty than upholding the law.\\nThe officer, marking his retirement as Chief Constable of Merseyside Police, said if he was given a \u00a35 billion budget to cut crime, he would spend \u00a31 billion on crime and \u00a34 billion on tackling poverty.\\nHe now serves in the role of Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary and Inspector of Fire and Rescue Authorities in England. He will be overseeing inspections primarily in the North of England.\\nMr Cooke was chief constable for five years, during which time he has overseen the jailing of dozens of multi-millionaire drug lords, including Liverpool's most notorious drugs boss Liam 'the Lam' Cornett, who was transported to court in a huge armed convoy every day, and the jet-setting Mulhare brothers, who were caught abroad in Thailand after being informed on by a 'supergrass'.\\n\\nUnder Mr Cooke, Merseyside Police gained a reputation for tough policing and for being a keen user of stop-and-search powers. He was also the first commander of Merseyside's Matrix unit, set up to tackle gang crime and violence.\\n\\nSimon Byrne: Top Northern Ireland cop 'with a reputation for being like Darth Vader'\\nSimon Byrne became chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland in May 2019, arriving at the force with 36 years of policing behind him.\\nAfter holding senior roles at GMP and the Met, he became chief constable of Cheshire Police from 2014 to 2017. That role ended in controversial circumstances after he was accused of bullying and humiliating staff.\\nA misconduct hearing was told he had a reputation for being like Darth Vader and treated junior officers and staff like 'roadkill'.\\nHowever, he was cleared of misconduct, with the tribunal concluding that much of what was claimed was either exaggerated or most likely didn't happen.\\nDuring his time as chief constable,\u00a0Mr Byrne revealed he had considered breaking the law in order to hire more officers from ethnic minorities. At that time the force only had three black officers.\\nHe told the BBC in 2017 that the law should be changed in England 'for a certain period of time' to allow the hiring of minority candidates to speed up. This would ensure that 'for every white officer, we recruit one black officer.'\\n\\nAt PSNI he attracted controversy for\u00a0suggesting the children of paramilitaries could be taken into care.\\nHe was also forced to apologise\u00a0after tweeting a photo of himself with officers holding rifles outside a PSNI station on Christmas Day, the BBC reported.\\nMartin Hewitt: NPCC chief who backed crackdown on Covid sceptics and said officers felt 'undervalued' amid pay row\\nAs chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) throughout the Covid crisis, Martin Hewitt has made a number of high-profile interventions in politics.\\nAmid fury last year at officers being hit by a pay freeze, Mr Hewitt told Priti\u00a0Patel that many officers believed the decision was 'unfair' and they felt 'undervalued' after their efforts during Covid.\\nMr Hewitt said: 'For many it feels unfair and that their contribution is undervalued.'\\n\\nIn January 2021, he backed a crackdown on lockdown sceptics and said officers\u00a0would no longer 'waste time' trying to reason with them amid soaring death rates.\\n\\nMr Hewitt was appointed in April 2019. He began his policing career with Kent Police in 1993 and transferred to the Metropolitan Police Service in 2005.\\nAs an Assistant Commissioner for five years, he led frontline and local policing, specialist crime and professional standards.\\nHe led the national police response to adult sexual offences and kidnap between 2014 and 2019, and served as a Vice-Chair for the NPCC from 2015 before taking on the chairmanship.\\nMatt Jukes: Assistant commissioner credited with leading crackdown on Rotherham child grooming gangs\\nMatt Jukes joined South Yorkshire police in 1995 three years after graduating with a degree in mathematics from Oxford.\\nHe worked as a detective and rose through the ranks to represent UK police forces at G8 meetings and lead on national anti-terror strategy.\\nMr Jukes is best known for tackling Rotherham grooming gangs while borough commander\u00a0in the Yorkshire town from 2006 to 2010.\\nMore than 1,000 children were exploited in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013, with local authorities, schools and police among agencies that failed to tackle the problem.\\nA report on the scandal by Professor Alexis Jay suggested that Mr Jukes' leadership marked a point where police became more proactive in dealing with the abuse.\\nAfter serving in South Yorkshire Police, he moved to South Wales, with the police and crime commissioner there Alun Michael backing him as an outstanding leader.\\nMr Jukes worked his way up to the top post in South Wales Police, becoming Chief Constable in January 2018. He is also chairman of Police Sport UK.\\nMr Jukes moved to the Met in\u00a0November 2020. He was awarded a Queens Police Medal in the New Year Honours List 2018.\\nDame Lynne Owens: Head of Britain's FBI who stepped down to fight breast cancer\\nWidely admired and was seen as the natural successor to the Yard top job until she retired on health grounds last autumn.\\nDame Lynne led the National Crime Agency - dubbed 'Britain's FBI' - from 2016 until last October.\\nSeen as a safe pair of hands, and known to be a favourite officer of Home Secretary Priti Patel.\\nDame Lynne, 53, has bravely written on social media of her mastectomy, radiotherapy and ongoing recovery. Whether she can be tempted back to such a high-pressure job will be a purely personal choice.\\nThe former chief constable of Surrey Police, who joined the Metropolitan Police service in 1989, was diagnosed with breast cancer earlier this year but said she now requires more extensive surgery which would mean a longer period of time off work.\\nSir Hugh Orde: 'The policeman's policeman' who 'loves the Met'\\nThe 64-year-old retired officer was described as a 'policeman's policeman' by his team in Northern Ireland, where he was chief constable.\\nOrde joined the Met in 1977 and was posted to south London when he was made a sergeant in his early 20s.\\nIn the 1990s, he developed the force's race relations training. He then developed Operation Trident, the Met's successful initiative to take guns of the streets. He then served as chief constable of Northern Ireland between 2002 and 2009.\\nAfter losing out to Sir Paul Stephenson for the Met's top job in 2009, he was appointed president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, before retiring.\\nDescribing his affinity with Scotland Yard he said: 'I've always loved the Met. In policing, it's one of the biggest challenges in the world'.\\nSir Dave Thompson: Chief constable of West Midlands Police who appears to stepping down just at the right time\\nEarlier this year West Midlands Police Chief Constable Dave Thompson announced he will leave his position after the Commonwealth Games - saying it is 'time to go'.\\nThe Chief Constable, who worked in the force for 12 years, said he wanted the force to have a fresh vision.\\nHe confirmed plans to leave after the 2022 Commonwealth Games in August.\\nHis decision to leave Britain's second force this year, could put him in a prime position for the top job at the Met.\\nThe West Midlands' top cop said officers and wider society must be actively anti-racist and stand against misogyny after 'shocking' messages exchanged by Metropolitan Police officers were made public.\\nSpeaking on the day he received his knighthood, chief constable Sir David Thompson said the conduct exposed by the national police watchdog should 'terrify us all'.\\nHe was reacting to the publication of messages exchanged by some Met officers in WhatsApp groups and a Facebook chat group, which included multiple references to rape, violence against women, racist and homophobic abuse.\\n\\nIn the end, it is a wonder she survived in the job so long.\\nOnly last year, her force was officially branded 'institutionally corrupt'. Incredibly, despite such a devastating finding, she did not resign.\\nInstead 'Teflon' Dame Cressida Dick has made a habit of trotting out humiliating apologies, for both recent and historical blunders, including admitting that the Sarah Everard debacle had brought 'shame' on the Metropolitan Police.\\nThe daughter of two Oxford academics, Dame Cressida, 61, joined the Metropolitan Police in 1983 after graduating from Oxford University with a degree in agriculture and forest sciences. Apart from a six-year spell at Thames Valley Police, she has spent her entire policing career at Scotland Yard.\\nHer first arrest, which came in her very first beat patrol in London's Soho in 1983, was of a man using a screwdriver to jemmy open the coin box in a telephone kiosk.\\nLater, at Bramshill Police College in 1995, she was the only woman out of ten officers chosen for fast-track promotion training, but she has been determined that her sex would not define her.\\nDame Cressida Dick will be succeeded by Deputy Commissioner Sir Stephen House, who is expected to take over the Partygate probe into events in Westminster during lockdown.\\nSir Stephen, Police Scotland's former Chief Constable, had his own career mired in controversy after it was claimed he was effectively kicked out of the force after a botched investigation into a car crash saw a woman left inside her vehicle for three days before being found alive.\\nLamara Bell and John Yuill lay in their car for three days despite a member of the public calling Police Scotland's non-emergency line to report a damaged vehicle. Miss Bell was still alive when emergency services finally arrived, but later died in hospital.\\nPolice Scotland was eventually fined \u00a3100,000 for health and safety failures over the fatal crash last September.\\nHe stood down and retired in 2015 following the incident, but it was later claimed he was effectively sacked by Nicola Sturgeon over the incident, her former aide Noel Dolan wrote in a bombshell book last year.\\nSir Stephen has also faced\u00a0criticism from Lib Dem MP and former police officer Wendy Chamberlain, who told the Evening Standard\u00a0he was a 'completely unsuitable' candidate to lead the Met.\\n'After so many scandals, the Met desperately needs strong new leadership to rebuild public trust.\\n'Putting it in the hands of someone who left his own trail of scandals in Police Scotland is not the way to do that.'\\nThe police chief was one of the first female undergraduates at Oxford's Balliol College in 1979. She always played cricket, football and rowed with 'the boys', saying it never bothered her. Later on, Dame Cressida was given time out to study for a qualification in criminology at Cambridge.\\nAt the Metropolitan Police, she was given responsibility for Operation Trident \u2013 which investigated gun and gang crimes \u2013 counterterrorism, the 2012 London Olympics, and ended up as the country's principal hostage negotiator.\\nBut since rising from an impressive rookie cop in the 1980s to the very top of British policing at the country's largest force, Dame Cressida has been embroiled in at least seven career-defining disasters.\\nThe wonder is that the first of them didn't spell the end.\\nTube death blunder\\nIn July 2005, Dame Cressida was in charge of the operation which saw blameless electrician Jean Charles de Menezes shot dead on a Tube train at Stockwell station in south London after he was mistaken for a terrorist who was under surveillance.\\nIt almost finished her career, and she says she thinks about it 'very often'.\\nThe armed officers believed him to be a fugitive suicide bomber who had escaped after failed attacks in London two weeks after the carnage of the 7/7 bombings.\\nDame Cressida was the 'gold commander' on the botched operation, and immediate lethal force \u2013 a shot to the head \u2013 was supposedly required because any other action risked setting off the suicide jacket.\\nNo officer, including Dame Cressida, faced any charges, and no one was reprimanded.\\nThe Met was found guilty of breaching health and safety laws and putting the public at risk, and was fined \u00a3175,000 and ordered to pay \u00a3385,000 costs from taxpayer funds. The Met chief was personally exonerated, but the shame of it lingered.\\nOperation Midland\\nIn 2014, Dame Cressida sanctioned the creation of Operation Midland, a disastrous investigation into spurious VIP child sex abuse allegations that saw completely innocent men pursued by the force.\\nFive years later, when the embarrassing operation began seriously unravelling, she refused to allow an inquiry into the conduct of officers involved.\\nThis was despite former High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques revealing how officers had used false evidence to obtain a search warrant for the raids. Dame Cressida said that an inquiry would be 'completely improper'.\\nWhile some of her calamities pre-dated her stint as Commissioner, this one sat squarely within her reign. A report in 2020 found the Metropolitan Police was more interested in covering up mistakes than learning from them.\\nThe Hampshire home of the Queen's confidant, Lord Bramall \u2013 who was also former head of the Armed Forces \u2013 had been invaded by police with search warrants in the early hours on the basis of spurious allegations of abuse by paedophile Carl Beech, a palpable fantasist.\\nAfter the Daily Mail exposed him, Beech was jailed. Before he died, D-Day hero Lord Bramall told his son Nick that 'he had never been so mortally wounded, even in battle'.\\nFormer Tory MP Harvey Proctor, who received a substantial payout after his life was ruined by the disastrous paedophile inquiry, last night expressed his delight at Dame Cressida's downfall.\\nHe was among seven high-profile victims of the Met \u2013 including Baroness Lawrence, whose son Stephen's 1993 murder investigation was botched by racist officers \u2013 who last year came together in a Mail interview to accuse Dame Cressida of having 'presided over a culture of incompetence'.\\nXR protests\\nIn 2019, Dame Cressida's force was widely condemned for its 'light-touch' policing of Extinction Rebellion protests, which blocked several key areas of London.\\nUnder her watch, career eco-activists from XR and its off-shoot Insulate Britain were given free rein to cause mayhem.\\nAmbulances were stopped from getting through, while businesses and workers were forced to halt their activities.\\nA low point came when police were filmed asking road-blocking protesters if they needed anything \u2013 rather than just arresting them.\\nDaniel Morgan\\nPerhaps the most jaw-dropping condemnation of Dame Cressida came in June of last year when an official report described her force as 'institutionally corrupt'.\\nAnd far from blaming the fiasco on a predecessor, it concluded that she had personally placed 'hurdles' in the way of a search for the truth about the death of Daniel Morgan \u2013 a private investigator who was brutally murdered in a south London pub car park in 1987.\\nDame Cressida was accused of 'obfuscation' for thwarting the Morgan inquiry team's attempts to access sensitive documents, leading to delays that cost the taxpayer millions. The report by Baroness O'Loan found that Scotland Yard was 'institutionally corrupt'.\\nThe Met has never found Mr Morgan's murderer, but there were long-standing allegations of police corruption over the killing and the aftermath.\\nMr Morgan's brother Alastair also joined Baroness Lawrence, Harvey Proctor and Lord Bramall in a devastating and unprecedented joint interview with the Daily Mail.\\nThey all signed a letter to the PM demanding Dame Cressida's resignation. Instead she clung on.\\nSarah Everard\\nThe brutally horrific murder of Sarah Everard in March last year by serving Met firearms officer Wayne Couzens went from disastrous to worse for Dame Cressida. She faced a clamour to quit after he was exposed as the killer.\\nIt then emerged Couzens had not been vetted properly and Met officers had failed to investigate after he was reported flashing women days before the murder.\\nBut perhaps the worst moment for the Commissioner was her officers' heavy-handed policing of a vigil for the murdered woman at Clapham Common in South London.\\nPhotographs of protesting women being pinned down by arresting officers who cited Covid restrictions on gatherings were published around the world, sparking condemnation.\\nWhen Couzens was convicted, it was dubbed Scotland Yard's 'darkest day'. Dame Cressida stood outside the Old Bailey and humbly admitted the murder had corroded trust in the police and brought 'shame' on her force.\\nMurder photos\\nIn December last year, two Scotland Yard officers who took photos of the bodies of two murder victims were jailed.\\nThe sisters who died \u2013 Nicole Smallman, 27, and 46-year-old Bibaa Henry, were black and there were accusations of racism. 2021 was also the force's worst ever year for teenage killings, with 30 deaths.\\nCharing Cross\\nEarlier this month, details emerged of horrific messages exchanged by officers at Charing Cross police station, by an official watchdog report.\\nSome 14 officers were investigated as a result, with two found to have a case to answer for gross misconduct.\\nOne was sacked and another resigned before he would have been dismissed. Another two had already left, while in some of the other cases the Independent Office of Police Conduct found 'no further action should be taken'.\\nIncredibly, nine officers kept their jobs and two were promoted \u2013 but their sickening WhatsApp messages exposed an ongoing culture of racism, sexism and bullying.\\nIt appears this sickening episode was the straw which finally broke the back. For, by the end, it was clear that confidence in the police chief had gone.", "image": [["The race is on to replace Dame Cressida Dick (pictured) as head of the Metropolitan Police, with the successful candidate tasked with making the force 'demonstrably more professional'", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/13/14/56567479-10715181-image-m-70_1649855420747.jpg"], ["The advert for the \u00a3293,000 role states that it has become 'evident that significant and sustained improvements need to be made within the MPS to restore public confidence and legitimacy in the largest police force in the UK'", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/13/14/56567469-10715181-image-m-71_1649855501036.jpg"], ["London Mayor Sadiq Khan will be able to advise on the decision regarding the next Met Police Commissioner, but the decision rests with Home Secretary Priti Patel.

Because of their size, on average, SUVs consume around a quarter more energy than medium-sized cars.\\nA 2019 study by the International Energy Agency found that they rank among the top contributors to energy-related carbon dioxide emissions growth over the past decade \u2014 cancelling out the reductions from people switching to electric cars.

He has a job to do, he has certain responsibilities in relation to the Metropolitan Police Service.\\n'He caused me to say that I would step aside, I did not voluntarily resign. What happened in the run-up to that and subsequently in the last few weeks perhaps, I don't know, will be looked at by Sir Tom Winsor.'\\nDame Cressida did not apologise for any of the Met's failings, adding: 'We hear the criticism, know not everyone has confidence in us to provide a good service when they need us, and have seen among us those whose horrific actions have let you all, and us, down so terribly.\\n'Each one drives us to get better, to root out those who don't uphold our standards and don't deserve to wear our uniform. To improve our response so all our communities feel protected by us'.\\nTouching on the Met's culture and claims of sexism and racism, she said: 'The Met is far more diverse and inclusive than it has ever been. It is a wonderful place to work and we need women and men of all backgrounds to join us and continue to make a difference'.\\nDame Cressida previously apologised publicly following the conclusions into the cases involving Ms Henry, Ms Smallman and Ms Everard, said she was 'seething angry' about the racist, sexist and homophobic messages from officers at Charing Cross station and defended how the force dealt with partygate.\\nTwo inquiries are currently under way looking at the culture within the Met.\\nDame Cressida said the culture in the force 'has been changing' following the death of Ms Everard and the publication of the WhatsApp messages.\\nShe added: 'I believe during my commissionership you have seen a real opening up of the Met. We are much more transparent, we are much closer to our public, and we have been seeking to root out the people who have let London down or may let London down, those people who can't live up to the professional standards that London would expect of its police service.\\n'We've had some horrible things done in the last year by people who were wearing and shaming the uniform of the Metropolitan Police. (It was an) awful, awful event with Sarah Everard being killed, a terrible thing, unimaginably bad for everyone. Since then, some other things have shocked the Me. But we haven't stood by - we were already changing very fast.'\\nShe then listed work being undertaken by the force to improve it, such as investing in professionalism, updating its unit which deals with officers who commit domestic abuse and sexual offences and involving the public to 'help improve its professionalism'.\\nShortly before Mr Khan stuck the boot in, an emotional Dame\u00a0Cressida\u00a0was given a guard of honour by officers this morning. She looked tearful as she saluted colleagues that lined up on the steps of the Metropolitan Police's headquarters close to Parliament.\\nMailOnline understands that the guard of honour had been weeks in the planning.\u00a0There were claps, three cheers and hugs from those 100-plus of her colleagues who gathered outside Scotland Yard. The outgoing chief, who was moved to tears, said 'thank you' repeatedly and 'au revoir' before hugging a child.\\nBut shortly afterwards, the London Mayor, who was at the launch of Labour's local election campaign in Barnet with party leader Sir Keir Starmer,\u00a0said: 'I'm not going to hide from the fact that I lost confidence in her.\\n'I'm not going to hide from the fact that we've had in our city a series of devastating scandals, overt racism, sexism, discrimination, homophobia, we've had trust and confidence from Londoners in the police service at rock bottom.\\n'It's one of the reasons why I lost confidence in her and it's one of the things I'll be looking for in a new commissioner, how they will address some of these serious issues that, frankly speaking, the current commissioner failed to address.'\\nOne fellow critic said in response to footage of the farewell: 'It should've been a guard of dishonour - helicopters emblazoned with every name of every victim & family she has humiliated over decades'.\\nAnother said: 'A guard of honour for the woman who bought dishonour and woke, leftist activism to the Met and who did nothing to protect women's and girl's honour'.\\nAsked about the timeline of appointing a successor for Dame Cressida Dick, Sadiq Khan said it could take 'a number of months'.\\nThe London mayor said: 'I'll be working closely with the Home Secretary to make sure we get the widest possible pool of candidates applying, we want the best possible candidate who is successful.\\n'Somebody who understands the challenges we face and also recognises the uniqueness of London, what a wonderful city we are, and how important it is to police by consent, to work with Londoners to restore confidence with women and girls in our city, but also minority communities, particularly black communities as well.'\\nDame Cressida leaves under a cloud after a string of scandals, both recent and historical, including admitting that\u00a0Sarah Everard's murder by a serving police officer\u00a0 had brought 'shame' on the force and damaged public confidence in police.\\nBritain's top cop also failed to get a grip on a culture of racism, sexism and bullying that has haunted Scotland Yard.\u00a0The force has also been criticised for being slow to investigate the reports of parties in Downing Street.\\nDame Cressida's last day in post will be on Sunday, after which she will take unused annual leave, with her final day of employment being April 24.\\nDefending her record, she said in her letter: 'Violence is down, our partnerships are strong and we are on course to achieve a step change in the number of crimes we solve.\\n'We have thousands more volunteers working with us, better ways of communicating with the public and higher levels of involvement by and engagement with our citizens in their police service.\\n'Murders, shootings and stabbings are all down. These figures are not an accident. They are not repeated in other major UK cities.\\n'They are down because we, working with our partners and communities, drove them down and have brought ever more serious offenders to justice. I am confident the reductions will be sustained: violent and predatory people, drug dealers and those involved in county lines gangs and organised crime will find it much tougher to operate.\\n'We have also learnt lessons from the terrible terrorism we saw in 2017. In the last five years, counter terrorism policing and UK intelligence services have stopped 29 attacks'.\\nI have been privileged to lead the Metropolitan Police Service for the last five years. I will always look back on my time as Commissioner with pride for what has been achieved, with humility for when Londoners have been let down, and with huge confidence the changes we have been making will ensure you can be proud of the Met going forward. I leave with the fondest of memories of the fantastic people I've been lucky enough to work with.\\nWhen I first took this role I set out my priorities. I knew we had to focus on what matters most to Londoners, particularly tackling violence which has been far too prevalent \u2013 often having the worst impact on the most vulnerable.\\nWe had to work more closely with others so we could collectively keep people safer and bring more offenders to justice.\\nFive years on, despite new and unexpected demands, grave tragedies and the toll of the pandemic I know we have made significant strides.\\nThe Met is nearly 200 years old and remains a world class police service. Our original principles of policing by consent, operational independence and impartiality are still utterly fundamental.\\nViolence is down, our partnerships are strong and we are on course to achieve a step change in the number of crimes we solve. We have thousands more volunteers working with us, better ways of communicating with the public and higher levels of involvement by and engagement with our citizens in their police service.\\nMurders, shootings and stabbings are all down. These figures are not an accident. They are not repeated in other major UK cities. They are down because we, working with our partners and communities, drove them down and have brought ever more serious offenders to justice. I am confident the reductions will be sustained: violent and predatory people, drug dealers and those involved in county lines gangs and organised crime will find it much tougher to operate.\\nWe have also learnt lessons from the terrible terrorism we saw in 2017. In the last five years, counter terrorism policing and UK intelligence services have stopped 29 attacks.\\nWe've innovated with our Counter Terrorism Operations Centre, a central London hub that brings together CT Policing's core capabilities and our partners \u2013 both in London and at a national level \u2013 under one roof. We have invested in better modern technologies to make us more effective and able to do more for less cost.\\nBut these successes, and so many others, are possible because of the brilliant, compassionate and courageous people of the Met, undertaking extraordinary work and caring deeply about the people, places, communities and victims they come to work to protect and serve.\\nWe will soon grow to a record size with thousands more officers \u2013 and we've just surpassed our highest number ever with over 34,000 officers as of last month. These are additional officers that you'll see in your neighbourhoods and keeping your town centres safe.\\nThe Met is far more diverse and inclusive than it has ever been. It is a wonderful place to work and we need women and men of all backgrounds to join us and continue to make a difference.\\nOf course as I look back there is more I wish we had achieved.\\nWe hear the criticism, know not everyone has confidence in us to provide a good service when they need us, and have seen among us those whose horrific actions have let you all, and us, down so terribly.\\nEach one drives us to get better, to root out those who don't uphold our standards and don't deserve to wear our uniform. To improve our response so all our communities feel protected by us.\\nWe are listening and acting on what you tell us so we can change for the better. Just this week we launched our violence against women and girls plan, shaped by the views of hundreds of Londoners.\\nThe current politicisation of policing is a threat not just to policing but to trust in the whole criminal justice system. Operational independence from local and central government is crucial for an effective democracy and is a model respected around the world. We must all treasure and protect it.\\nNow more than ever the mission of the Met is to keep this amazing, global, diverse capital city safe for everyone, to get back to basics, to improve, to innovate and make sure we bring offenders to justice.\\nOn a personal level I'm sad my time in this great job is fast drawing to a close however I am extremely optimistic for the Met's future. It is bigger, more diverse, more capable than ever.\\nMy message to London is this: London is a safe city in so many ways. You have a fantastic police service. We all need the Met to be successful in keeping London safe and for the public to have confidence in our service. The 44,000 women and men of the Met care passionately about getting it right and always want to be here for you.\\nDame Cressida's deputy Sir Steve House will serve as acting commissioner in the meantime. Priti Patel insisted Sir Steve will provide 'stability and continuity' for the Met.\\nThis afternoon, nobody going in or out of the Met's New Scotland Yard HQ in Westminster was prepared to comment on whether the send off to Ms Dick was genuine, or if staff there had been encouraged to get involved.\\nHowever, sources said that Ms Dick was extremely well-liked among her underlings, and her departure was typically viewed as unwelcome.\\nLeading members of the National Black Police Association - which supports Black and Minority Ethnic staff in UK policing - and the Metropolitan Black Police Association - which endeavours to improve the working environment of Black personnel within the Metropolitan Police Service - who could both have been said to be the most pleased at Ms Dick's departure, given her record on tackling racism inside the force, were said to be \"gutted\" that she was leaving.\\nOne said: 'Everyone seems to think Cressida is very unpopular here, but the truth is she just isn't, and will be missed by the majority of Met employees.'\\n\\nKen Marsh, the chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said the guard of honour held for outgoing Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick was unique.\\nHe said: 'It's never been done before and will probably never be done again.\\n'It was planned weeks ago so the rank-and-file could show their support for Cressida Dick and to show how appallingly she's been treated.\\n'I don't think people realise the strength of feeling that officers have at her being forcibly removed by the Mayor of London.\\n'The support for her and for today's guard of honour has come from across the board, from officers on the frontline to those retired officers who remember her from 40-plus years back.\\n'Cressida is Met through and through and today's action outside New Scotland Yard was a way of officers being able to voice that support because it's usually the Mayor with the media platform.'\\nShe finally quit in February after a tsunami of scandals, including the Sarah Everard murder by cop Wayne Couzens, Daniel Morgan's death and Carl Beech's VIP child sex abuse claims.\\nIt followed the London mayor saying he was not happy with her response to offensive messages by a group of officers based at Charing Cross police station.\\nIt is not clear who will take over from her, but anti-terror chief Neil Basu, ex-Merseyside chief Andy Cooke and Northern Ireland's Simon Byrne are in the running.\\nIt came as Miss Patel announced details of a formal inquiry into how Dame Cressida came to be forced out of her job by London mayor Sadiq Khan.\\nA review will look at 'whether due process was followed' by the Labour politician.\\nThe inquiry will be carried out by the current Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Tom Winsor once he steps down from that role on Thursday this week.\\nThe timing and nature of the inquiry are likely to mean Sir Tom will have more flexibility to make politically-sensitive criticisms of the London Mayor.\\nMiss Patel said: 'It is right that we have appropriate legislation in place to govern the modern policing environment and I believe the circumstances leading up to Dame Cressida's departure warrant further scrutiny, which is why I have commissioned Sir Tom Winsor to conduct this review.'\\nShe added: 'Dame Cressida was at the helm of the Met during extremely tough times, with terror attacks and the pandemic among the challenges she faced.\\n'Her dedication to protecting London and Londoners has helped drive down serious violence in the city and for that in particular she deserves our gratitude.\\n'Sir Steve House, her current deputy, will provide the stability and continuity the force needs as we focus on appointing the right person to lead the country's largest force and make London an even safer place to live, work and visit.'\\nDame Cressida announced her resignation in February after Mr Khan's aides indicated that he had no confidence in her ability to shake-up her force after a series of scandals, including murder of Sarah Everard by serving officer Wayne Couzens.\\nNegotiations are continuing over how much she will be paid in compensation after being handed a two-year contract extension last September.\\nThe commissioner's job has not yet even been formally advertised, meaning a new chief will not be in place until summer.\\nA spokesman for the Mr Khan said: 'Public trust in the Met Police is at the lowest level on record, following a series of devastating scandals including the murder of Sarah Everard by a serving police officer and the overt racism, sexism, misogyny, homophobia and discrimination exposed at Charing Cross police ptation.\\n'It was against this backdrop that the mayor lost confidence in the ability of the current Met Commissioner to lead the deep-rooted change needed.\\n'The mayor is now working with the Home Secretary to appoint a new commissioner who understands the depths of the problems faced by the force and has a plan to restore the trust and confidence of Londoners.'\\nSir Steve was forced to step down as head of Police Scotland in 2015 after a string of errors by the force, before being brought back to policing by Dame Cressida to serve as her deputy in the Met.\\nCity Hall wanted to gag the outgoing Scotland Yard commissioner with a confidentiality clause before they were overruled by London's mayor, it was reported.\\nSources close to Sadiq Khan said the mayor had personally directed that Dame Cressida be permitted to say what she wants about the public fallout that led to her resignation, however.\\nMr Khan is also said to have tried to block Dame Cressida from receiving a compensation payment after he effectively drove her from the role.\\nIn the end, it is a wonder she survived in the job so long.\\nOnly last year, her force was officially branded 'institutionally corrupt'. Incredibly, despite such a devastating finding, she did not resign.\\nInstead 'Teflon' Dame Cressida Dick has made a habit of trotting out humiliating apologies, for both recent and historical blunders, including admitting that the Sarah Everard debacle had brought 'shame' on the Metropolitan Police.\\nThe daughter of two Oxford academics, Dame Cressida, 61, joined the Metropolitan Police in 1983 after graduating from Oxford University with a degree in agriculture and forest sciences. Apart from a six-year spell at Thames Valley Police, she has spent her entire policing career at Scotland Yard.\\nHer first arrest, which came in her very first beat patrol in London's Soho in 1983, was of a man using a screwdriver to jemmy open the coin box in a telephone kiosk.\\nLater, at Bramshill Police College in 1995, she was the only woman out of ten officers chosen for fast-track promotion training, but she has been determined that her sex would not define her.\\nDame Cressida Dick will be succeeded by Deputy Commissioner Sir Stephen House, who is expected to take over the Partygate probe into events in Westminster during lockdown.\\nSir Stephen, Police Scotland's former Chief Constable, had his own career mired in controversy after it was claimed he was effectively kicked out of the force after a botched investigation into a car crash saw a woman left inside her vehicle for three days before being found alive.\\nLamara Bell and John Yuill lay in their car for three days despite a member of the public calling Police Scotland's non-emergency line to report a damaged vehicle. Miss Bell was still alive when emergency services finally arrived, but later died in hospital.\\nPolice Scotland was eventually fined \u00a3100,000 for health and safety failures over the fatal crash last September.\\nHe stood down and retired in 2015 following the incident, but it was later claimed he was effectively sacked by Nicola Sturgeon over the incident, her former aide Noel Dolan wrote in a bombshell book last year.\\nSir Stephen has also faced\u00a0criticism from Lib Dem MP and former police officer Wendy Chamberlain, who told the Evening Standard\u00a0he was a 'completely unsuitable' candidate to lead the Met.\\n'After so many scandals, the Met desperately needs strong new leadership to rebuild public trust.\\n'Putting it in the hands of someone who left his own trail of scandals in Police Scotland is not the way to do that.'\\nThe police chief was one of the first female undergraduates at Oxford's Balliol College in 1979. She always played cricket, football and rowed with 'the boys', saying it never bothered her. Later on, Dame Cressida was given time out to study for a qualification in criminology at Cambridge.\\nAt the Metropolitan Police, she was given responsibility for Operation Trident \u2013 which investigated gun and gang crimes \u2013 counterterrorism, the 2012 London Olympics, and ended up as the country's principal hostage negotiator.\\nBut since rising from an impressive rookie cop in the 1980s to the very top of British policing at the country's largest force, Dame Cressida has been embroiled in at least seven career-defining disasters.\\nThe wonder is that the first of them didn't spell the end.\\nTube death blunder\\nIn July 2005, Dame Cressida was in charge of the operation which saw blameless electrician Jean Charles de Menezes shot dead on a Tube train at Stockwell station in south London after he was mistaken for a terrorist who was under surveillance.\\nIt almost finished her career, and she says she thinks about it 'very often'.\\nThe armed officers believed him to be a fugitive suicide bomber who had escaped after failed attacks in London two weeks after the carnage of the 7/7 bombings.\\nDame Cressida was the 'gold commander' on the botched operation, and immediate lethal force \u2013 a shot to the head \u2013 was supposedly required because any other action risked setting off the suicide jacket.\\nNo officer, including Dame Cressida, faced any charges, and no one was reprimanded.\\nThe Met was found guilty of breaching health and safety laws and putting the public at risk, and was fined \u00a3175,000 and ordered to pay \u00a3385,000 costs from taxpayer funds. The Met chief was personally exonerated, but the shame of it lingered.\\nOperation Midland\\nIn 2014, Dame Cressida sanctioned the creation of Operation Midland, a disastrous investigation into spurious VIP child sex abuse allegations that saw completely innocent men pursued by the force.\\nFive years later, when the embarrassing operation began seriously unravelling, she refused to allow an inquiry into the conduct of officers involved.\\nThis was despite former High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques revealing how officers had used false evidence to obtain a search warrant for the raids. Dame Cressida said that an inquiry would be 'completely improper'.\\nWhile some of her calamities pre-dated her stint as Commissioner, this one sat squarely within her reign. A report in 2020 found the Metropolitan Police was more interested in covering up mistakes than learning from them.\\nThe Hampshire home of the Queen's confidant, Lord Bramall \u2013 who was also former head of the Armed Forces \u2013 had been invaded by police with search warrants in the early hours on the basis of spurious allegations of abuse by paedophile Carl Beech, a palpable fantasist.\\nAfter the Daily Mail exposed him, Beech was jailed. Before he died, D-Day hero Lord Bramall told his son Nick that 'he had never been so mortally wounded, even in battle'.\\nFormer Tory MP Harvey Proctor, who received a substantial payout after his life was ruined by the disastrous paedophile inquiry, last night expressed his delight at Dame Cressida's downfall.\\nHe was among seven high-profile victims of the Met \u2013 including Baroness Lawrence, whose son Stephen's 1993 murder investigation was botched by racist officers \u2013 who last year came together in a Mail interview to accuse Dame Cressida of having 'presided over a culture of incompetence'.\\nXR protests\\nIn 2019, Dame Cressida's force was widely condemned for its 'light-touch' policing of Extinction Rebellion protests, which blocked several key areas of London.\\nUnder her watch, career eco-activists from XR and its off-shoot Insulate Britain were given free rein to cause mayhem.\\nAmbulances were stopped from getting through, while businesses and workers were forced to halt their activities.\\nA low point came when police were filmed asking road-blocking protesters if they needed anything \u2013 rather than just arresting them.\\nDaniel Morgan\\nPerhaps the most jaw-dropping condemnation of Dame Cressida came in June of last year when an official report described her force as 'institutionally corrupt'.\\nAnd far from blaming the fiasco on a predecessor, it concluded that she had personally placed 'hurdles' in the way of a search for the truth about the death of Daniel Morgan \u2013 a private investigator who was brutally murdered in a south London pub car park in 1987.\\nDame Cressida was accused of 'obfuscation' for thwarting the Morgan inquiry team's attempts to access sensitive documents, leading to delays that cost the taxpayer millions. The report by Baroness O'Loan found that Scotland Yard was 'institutionally corrupt'.\\nThe Met has never found Mr Morgan's murderer, but there were long-standing allegations of police corruption over the killing and the aftermath.\\nMr Morgan's brother Alastair also joined Baroness Lawrence, Harvey Proctor and Lord Bramall in a devastating and unprecedented joint interview with the Daily Mail.\\nThey all signed a letter to the PM demanding Dame Cressida's resignation. Instead she clung on.\\nSarah Everard\\nThe brutally horrific murder of Sarah Everard in March last year by serving Met firearms officer Wayne Couzens went from disastrous to worse for Dame Cressida. She faced a clamour to quit after he was exposed as the killer.\\nIt then emerged Couzens had not been vetted properly and Met officers had failed to investigate after he was reported flashing women days before the murder.\\nBut perhaps the worst moment for the Commissioner was her officers' heavy-handed policing of a vigil for the murdered woman at Clapham Common in South London.\\nPhotographs of protesting women being pinned down by arresting officers who cited Covid restrictions on gatherings were published around the world, sparking condemnation.\\nWhen Couzens was convicted, it was dubbed Scotland Yard's 'darkest day'. Dame Cressida stood outside the Old Bailey and humbly admitted the murder had corroded trust in the police and brought 'shame' on her force.\\nMurder photos\\nIn December last year, two Scotland Yard officers who took photos of the bodies of two murder victims were jailed.\\nThe sisters who died \u2013 Nicole Smallman, 27, and 46-year-old Bibaa Henry, were black and there were accusations of racism. 2021 was also the force's worst ever year for teenage killings, with 30 deaths.\\nCharing Cross\\nEarlier this month, details emerged of horrific messages exchanged by officers at Charing Cross police station, by an official watchdog report.\\nSome 14 officers were investigated as a result, with two found to have a case to answer for gross misconduct.\\nOne was sacked and another resigned before he would have been dismissed. Another two had already left, while in some of the other cases the Independent Office of Police Conduct found 'no further action should be taken'.\\nIncredibly, nine officers kept their jobs and two were promoted \u2013 but their sickening WhatsApp messages exposed an ongoing culture of racism, sexism and bullying.\\nIt appears this sickening episode was the straw which finally broke the back.

We need everyone to join us.'\\nHe continued: 'We're looking at more mass participation-style events, rather than small kind of scattergun actions which rebellions have previously consisted of. We're looking at mass participation, which are easy to join.\\n'We're asking the public to step up and join us.\u00a0We know at the moment that across the country, people are feeling kind of disenfranchised with how they've been treated by the Government.\\n'The energy crisis is really starting to hit home on people, and people really want us to step up into a space where their voice is heard.\\n'We're offering them the space where they can come and participate and join with us. Every morning we'll be offering non-violent direct action training, where we will encourage people to step up and be empowered to take action with us and speak out against Government inaction.\u00a0As a response to that, the actions will feel and look very different to previous rebellions.", "image": [["Activists from the Just Stop Oil environmental group attempt to block traffic in Thurrock on Wedneday morning", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/08/18/56385627-10700535-image-a-33_1649438254622.jpg"], ["The eco protesters have been using tactics including attaching themselves to fuel tankers with glue and bike locks.

It noted that the\u00a0UNHCR has previously sad the country is safe for refugees.\\n'Under this agreement, Rwanda will process claims in accordance with the UN Refugee Convention, national and international human rights laws, and will ensure their protection from inhuman and degrading treatment or being returned to the place they originally fled,' the Home Office's statement said.\\n'There is nothing in the UN Refugee Convention which prevents removal to a safe country',' it added.\\nMr Johnson last night pledged the first flights could take off within just six weeks, and said he would do\u00a0'whatever it takes' to push through his landmark scheme to tackle the small-boats crisis in the Channel and smash people trafficking gangs.\\nRevealing details of the dramatic strategy, Mr Johnson said 'tens of thousands' of Channel migrants would be sent to the East African nation \u2013 4,000 miles away.\\nThe Daily Mail understands the first flight is expected to leave before the end of next month \u2013 and the scheme will be back-dated to cover all those who have arrived in the UK since the start of the year.\\nMeanwhile on Friday, at\u00a0least\u00a050 migrants arrived in the UK by boat on the first official day of Navy patrols in the Channel.\\nBetween 25 and 30 migrants reached the Dover harbour, Kent around 2.30am Friday morning before a second group, of around 30 people, was escorted to shore on board Border Force cutter Valiant shortly before 10am.\\nThe Home Office and the MoD are yet to confirm the official number of migrants to arrive in the UK today, or on Wednesday or Thursday - but it is thought more than 1,000 people made the perilous crossing.\\nAccording to official Home Office figures, at least 4,617 people have reached the UK by small boat so far this year but recent arrivals could bring the total number of migrant crossings for 2022 to more than 5,500.\\nCross-channel arrivals assessed and anyone deemed an economic migrant rather than a refugee is sent to Rwanda\\nMs Patel agreed a \u00a3120 million economic deal while in Kigali on Thursday, and money for each removal is expected to follow, with reports suggesting each migrant sent to Rwanda is expected to set British taxpayers back between \u00a320,000 and \u00a330,000.\\nThe Times said this would cover accommodation both before and after the journey, as well as the cost of a seat on the flight itself.\\nThe Royal Navy has been put in charge of policing the Channel as part of the reform package announced this week, in a bid to curb the number of small boat crossings.\\nThe Ministry of Defence (MoD) said that, in the 24-hour period up to 11.59pm on Thursday April 14, the navy detected 562 migrants in 14 small boats in the strait.\\nThe department said it did not believe any migrants arrived 'on their own terms in a small boat' on Thursday, but on Good Friday women, children and single men were among hundreds of people brought ashore.\\nNaval ships were spotted towing empty dinghies used by people smugglers back to the UK after those on board were offloaded on to boats operated by Border Force, which is part of the Home Office.\\nTom Pursglove, minister for justice and tackling illegal migration, said on Friday that the policy was 'in line' with the UK's legal obligations.\\nHowever, he accepted that it would be 'difficult' to implement the plan to remove asylum seekers to Rwanda, with the Government braced for legal challenges.\\nHe told Times Radio: 'I think what is also really important to make (clear) in dealing with that issue is that, at all times, we act in accordance with our international obligations, the ECHR (European Convention on Human Rights) and the refugee convention.\\n'We are absolutely confident that our policies are in line with that and entirely compliant, which by extension would mean that those legal challenges would be without merit.\\n'But it will be difficult, there will be challenges.'\\nMr Pursglove also suggested during broadcast interviews that other countries in Europe were considering emulating the UK's Rwandan policy, which he described as a 'world first'.\\nRwanda is a landlocked country in central and eastern Africa best known in the west for the horrific 1994 ethnic genocide.\\nIn just 100 days of a brutal civil war, up to 800,000 Tutsi people were murdered, with many of them hacked to death in their homes by armed militias of the Hutu majority.\\nUp to half a million women were raped as violence gripped the country, often with neighbours turning on neighbours.\\nThe carnage provoked horror and condemnation around the world, and the Tutsi-led\u00a0Rwandan Patriotic Front later won the war and forced those responsible for the murder into exile.\\nBut while the country is more stable today, it still has a highly questionable human rights record.\\nEarlier this week the US State Department produced its annual analysis of the country.\\nIt reported 'significant human rights issues' with the Government, including:\\nIt added: 'The government took some steps to prosecute or punish officials who committed abuses and acts of corruption, including within the security services, but impunity involving civilian officials and some members of the state security forces was a problem.'\\nIn a separate report, Amnesty International reports similar findings.\\nWhile noting the Kagame government had acted to help women prosecuted for having abortions, and to prosecute those accused of genocide, it added: 'Violations of the rights to a fair trial, freedom of expression and privacy continued, alongside enforced disappearances, allegations of torture and excessive use of force.'\\n\\n\\nHe said there was a 'moral imperative' to crush the business model of human traffickers and avoid a tragedy like that seen in November, when a dinghy sank in the English Channel, drowning dozens of migrants heading to Britain.\\n'The point I would make is that what is cruel and inhumane is allowing evil criminal gangs to take advantage of people, to take their money, to put them in small boats, often with force, including women and children, to put them in the Channel with all the risks that that presents to human life,' he told ITV's Good Morning Britain.\\n'We simply cannot allow that to happen, which is why we've introduced the new plan for immigration to stop these illegal journeys.'\\nThe minister also argued that in the 'longer term' the scheme would save Britain money, with almost \u00a35 million per day currently spent on accommodating those arriving in the country.\\nFormer Tory international development secretary Andrew Mitchell questioned that, saying calculations had been made that suggested it would be cheaper to put those arriving in Britain up at The Ritz hotel in London's Mayfair for a year.\\nThe price of each migrant sent to Rwanda to the taxpayer is estimated to be between \u00a320,000 and \u00a330,000.\u00a0This total figure will cover accommodation before departure, a seat on a chartered plane and their first three months of accommodation in Rwanda, the Times reports.\\nThe government will also spend \u00a350 million on bolstering surveillance in the Channel - including new ships, military drones, and a Wildcat helicopter.\\nProtests against the policy have come from opposition party politicians, human rights bodies and campaign groups, who branded the measures as 'evil', 'cruel' and 'unethical'.\\nMore than\u00a0160 British organisations \u2013 including Liberty, Stonewall, Greenpeace and\u00a0Bond\u00a0- the UK umbrella body of NGOs \u2013 all signed an open letter to the Prime Minister and Home Secretary in protest at the deal.\\nMinisters are braced for a fierce legal fight to stop opponents from scuppering the scheme before it starts. Mr Johnson accepted that the plan would be 'challenged in the courts', but insisted he was confident about its legality.\\nIn a major speech in Kent yesterday, Mr Johnson accepted the Rwandan deal was not a 'magic bullet' that will solve the small-boats crisis.\\nBut he said it would 'save countless lives' by breaking the business model of the 'vile people smugglers' who risk turning the Channel into a 'watery graveyard'.\\nOfficials expect thousands who entered the country by illegal means will be removed to Rwanda in the coming years.\\nMr Johnson said arrangements with the African country will be 'uncapped', and it had the 'capacity to resettle tens of thousands of people in the years ahead'.\\nHe said the partnership will be 'fully compliant with our international legal obligations', but acknowledged the Government was braced for court challenges.\\n'If this country is seen as a soft touch for illegal migration by some of our partners, it is precisely because we have such a formidable army of politically motivated lawyers who for years have made it their business to thwart removals and frustrate the Government,' he said.\\n'So I know that this system will not take effect overnight, but I promise that we will do whatever it takes to deliver this new approach, initially within the limits of the existing legal and constitutional frameworks, but also prepared to explore any and all further legal reforms which may be necessary.'\\nMiss Patel insisted she was confident she would be able to fend off moves to thwart the plans in the courts. Asked if she is preparing for legal challenges, the Home Secretary said: 'We have to. Well, in the same way in which our political opponents just sort of opine a view, condemn everything that the Government does.\\n'Number one, they don't have a plan. Number two, they just vote everything down constantly. And as for the lawyers, they are fleecing the British taxpayer. A lot of this is legal aid money that goes into the merry go round of claim after claim after claim.'\\nPushed on whether the scheme was reliant on legislation going through Parliament that critics have threatened to vote down, Miss Patel said: 'No, no, it's not.\u00a0The whole principle of this agreement partnership that we have is not hinged on the Nationality and Borders Bill, let me be clear about that.\\n'In terms of domestic litigation, we have worked extensively... the level of detail (in the Memorandum of Understanding setting out the agreement) is forensic.'\\nThe Law Society dismissed Mr Johnson's criticism of lawyers. In a thinly veiled reference to Partygate, its president I.

Mr Johnson accepted that the plan would be 'challenged in the courts', but insisted he was confident about its legality.\\nIt came as:\\nRwanda is a landlocked country in central and eastern Africa best known in the west for the horrific 1994 ethnic genocide.\\nIn just 100 days of a brutal civil war, up to 800,000 Tutsi people were murdered, with many of them hacked to death in their homes by armed militias of the Hutu majority.\\nUp to half a million women were raped as violence gripped the country, often with neighbours turning on neighbours.\\nThe carnage provoked horror and condemnation around the world, and the Tutsi-led\u00a0Rwandan Patriotic Front later won the war and forced those responsible for the murder into exile.\\nBut while the country is more stable today, it still has a highly questionable human rights record.\\nEarlier this week the US State Department produced its annual analysis of the country.\\nIt reported 'significant human rights issues' with the Government, including:\\nIt added: 'The government took some steps to prosecute or punish officials who committed abuses and acts of corruption, including within the security services, but impunity involving civilian officials and some members of the state security forces was a problem.'\\nIn a separate report, Amnesty International reports similar findings.\\nWhile noting the Kagame government had acted to help women prosecuted for having abortions, and to prosecute those accused of genocide, it added: 'Violations of the rights to a fair trial, freedom of expression and privacy continued, alongside enforced disappearances, allegations of torture and excessive use of force.'\\nImmigration Minister Tom Pursglove today defended Rwanda, saying that since the genocide it has made 'huge strides forward', telling Sky: 'They have a rich and proud history, rather like we do in this country, of providing sanctuary to people who need it.\\n'Rwanda\u2026 has a female majority parliament, it has an anti-discrimination law that runs right through its constitution.\\n'The UNHCR themselves place refugees in Rwanda as part of their schemes which of course is providing sanctuary to them.'\\n\\nThe government wants tens of thousands of\u00a0people moved within the next few years, but some experts are warning of a surge of Channel crossings before the policy comes into effect, the Times reports.\\nMP Simon Hoare told the paper: 'All\u00a0this will do is mean we'll see a vast\u00a0amount of people trying [to cross] now\u00a0before this comes in'.\\nPeople smugglers\u00a0would be encouraging people to cross\u00a0with a 'must end soon' sale, he added.\\nThe Royal Navy was drafted in yesterday to take charge of operations in the Channel as part of the sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration.\\nLast night, there were howls of protest from opposition party politicians, human rights bodies and campaign groups, who branded the measures as 'evil', 'cruel' and 'unethical'.\\nMore than\u00a0160 British organisations \u2013 including Liberty, Stonewall and Greenpeace \u2013 all signed an open letter to the Prime Minister and Home Secretary in protest at the deal.\\nThere have also been concerns over the cost of the scheme, with the price of each migrant sent to Rwanda to the taxpayer estimated to be between \u00a320,000 and \u00a330,000.\\nThis total figure will cover accommodation before\u00a0departure, a seat on a chartered plane\u00a0and their first three months of\u00a0accommodation in Rwanda, the Times reports.\\nIn a major speech in Kent yesterday, Mr Johnson accepted the Rwandan deal was not a 'magic bullet' that will solve the small-boats crisis.\\nBut he said it would 'save countless lives' by breaking the business model of the 'vile people smugglers' who risk turning the Channel into a 'watery graveyard'.\\nOfficials expect thousands who entered the country by illegal means will be removed to Rwanda in the coming years.\\nMr Johnson said arrangements with the African country will be 'uncapped', and it had the 'capacity to resettle tens of thousands of people in the years ahead'.\\nHe said the partnership will be 'fully compliant with our international legal obligations', but acknowledged the Government was braced for court challenges.\\n'If this country is seen as a soft touch for illegal migration by some of our partners, it is precisely because we have such a formidable army of politically motivated lawyers who for years have made it their business to thwart removals and frustrate the Government,' he said.\\n'So I know that this system will not take effect overnight, but I promise that we will do whatever it takes to deliver this new approach, initially within the limits of the existing legal and constitutional frameworks, but also prepared to explore any and all further legal reforms which may be necessary.'\\nMiss Patel insisted she was confident she would be able to fend off moves to thwart the plans in the courts. Asked if she is preparing for legal challenges, the Home Secretary said: 'We have to. Well, in the same way in which our political opponents just sort of opine a view, condemn everything that the Government does.\\n'Number one, they don't have a plan. Number two, they just vote everything down constantly. And as for the lawyers, they are fleecing the British taxpayer. A lot of this is legal aid money that goes into the merry go round of claim after claim after claim.'\\nPushed on whether the scheme was reliant on legislation going through Parliament that critics have threatened to vote down, Miss Patel said: 'No, no, it's not.\u00a0The whole principle of this agreement partnership that we have is not hinged on the Nationality and Borders Bill, let me be clear about that. In terms of domestic litigation, we have worked extensively... the level of detail (in the Memorandum of Understanding setting out the agreement) is forensic.'\\nThe Law Society dismissed Mr Johnson's criticism of lawyers.

It forms part of increase in capacity measure to deliver more timely decisions.\\n'I appreciate my constituents may have a number of questions about this site, but it is important to note these claims must be processed somewhere and in a humane and managed manner.\\n'I want to assure constituents I will be working closely with the Home Office on this throughout.\\n'It is crucial that those being processed are housed in suitable and appropriate settings, with recreation and social facilities to enable those individuals to live as normal a life as possible.\\n'I have been assured the time limit for any asylum seekers to remain the site will be 180 days and I have ensured the Minister is clear this must be stuck to, to ensure those waiting for decisions are not unduly delayed.'\\nMr Hollinrake added that he is in discussions with the government about how to minimise 'disturbance' to local residents in the small village.\\nIt is anticipated that up to 300 jobs could be created on the RAF base, including 'a number of new business opportunities in catering and other areas'.\\nMr Hollinrake said: 'There are a number of conditions I wanted to ensure were considered in advance of the site opening.\\n'I have made it clear the local community must be at the heart of these plans, prioritising those in the area for any jobs which may be required at the site.'\\n'I have spoken to other members of parliament who already have similar facilities in their areas. Initial concerns around disturbance to local communities has not been borne out in practice, so hopefully this will be the case here also.\\n'I have also asked the Minister if he can consider opening the site up to Ukrainian refugees, given the heartwarming response from Thirsk and Malton constituents to the crisis.\\n'I will keep constituents updated with any further developments.'\\nThere are concerns about the new Rwandan immigration policy considering the country's human rights record.\\nAccording to the campaign group Human Rights Watch, 'arbitrary detention, ill-treatment, and torture in official and unofficial detention facilities is commonplace, and fair trial standards are routinely flouted in many sensitive political cases, in which security-related charges are often used to prosecute prominent government critics. Arbitrary detention and mistreatment of street children, sex workers and petty vendors occurs widely.'\\nIt comes as Boris Johnson ordered the Royal Navy to police the English Channel and stop small boats from today.\\nThe Prime Minister ordered warships to take over from the Border Force as the latest wave of arrivals from France were pictured landing in Kent.\\nSpeaking just a few miles away he hailed the UK as a 'beacon of openness' before confirming an agreement with Rwanda to send boat people 4,000 miles to the east African nation - in many cases permanently.\\nIn a speech this morning the Prime Minister invoked the spirit of Brexit as he unveiled the \u00a3120million scheme, saying: 'The British people voted several times to control our borders.'\\nHe\u00a0said that while the UK's compassion may be 'endless', its capacity to host people was not, adding: 'We cannot expect the UK taxpayer to write a black cheque.'\\nMinisters have struck a 'world-first' deal with the government of Paul Kigame to host economic migrants. Home Secretary Priti Patel\u00a0arrived in Rwandan capital Kigali last night and is due to sign a five-year agreement today.\\nOfficials believe the agreement to 'off-shore' the processing of asylum seekers will deter thousands of migrants from crossing the Channel in dinghies, saving lives and cutting off income from the criminal gangs that control the trade.\\nBut the plan has already faced a massive backlash, with claims that it is both cruel and expensive.\u00a0Rwanda is best known in the west for a 1994 ethnic genocide that left up to 800,000 Tutsi people dead and it still has a mixed human rights records.\\nAmnesty International says there are still concerns over 'enforced disappearances, allegations of torture and excessive use of force'.\u00a0Earlier this month the Refugee Minister Lord Harrington said there was 'no possibility' of migrants being sent there.\\nBut Mr Johnson today branded it 'dynamic' and one of the safest countries in the world. And answering questions in Kigali, Ms Patel said the country had an 'established record of welcoming and integrating people'.\\nSpeaking at a press conference she said the African country had 'one of the strongest records for refugee resettlement' and, in recent years, had resettled more than 130,000 refugees.\\nIt is understood Channel migrants will be processed in the UK and officials will decide whether they are a genuine asylum seeker. If they are deemed to be economic migrants, they will be sent to Rwanda, where schemes will be put in place to help them build a new life.\\nIt is thought that in other cases, all asylum processing will take place after the claimant arrives in Rwanda. Britain will pay the costs of their resettlement.\\nA source told the Telegraph that the British Army would be involved to prevent 'battles on the quayside', adding: 'They will drive you to the airport and send you straight to Rwanda'.\\nThe Refugee Council charity was among those to urge an immediate rethink of the plan, with chief\u00a0executive Enver Solomon saying it would not work and would cost the taxpayer around \u00a31.4billion a year as part of the while asylum system.\\nThe United Nations refugee agency also expressed concern over the 'shifting rather than the\u00a0sharing of responsibilities'.\\nLabour and Mr Johnson's Tory critics claimed it was an expensive move to switch attention away from the Partygate row which continues to embarrass No10.\\nYvette Cooper, the shadow home\u00a0secretary, told the Guardian it was a 'shameful announcement\u00a0meant to distract from Boris Johnson's recent law-breaking.\\n'It is an unworkable, unethical and\u00a0extortionate policy that would cost\u00a0the UK taxpayer billions of pounds\u00a0during a cost of living crisis and\u00a0would make it harder, not easier, to\u00a0get fast and fair asylum decisions,'\u00a0she said.\\nConservative former minister Andrew Mitchell said housing asylum seekers at the Ritz hotel would be cheaper than offshoring, claiming the cost to the British taxpayer would be \u00a32million per person, per year.\\nMr Johnson criticised the 'rank unfairness' of the current asylum system, which he claimed is being exploited by men entering via small boat crossings at the expense of women and children.\\nSpeaking at Lydd Airport near Dungeness, the Prime Minister said: 'Our compassion may be infinite but our capacity to help people is not. We can't ask the British taxpayer to write a blank cheque to cover the costs of anyone who might want to come and live here.\\n'Uncontrolled immigration creates unmanageable demands on our NHS and on our welfare state, it overstretches our local schools, our housing and public transport and creates unsustainable pressure to build on precious green spaces.\\n'Nor is it fair on those who are seeking to come here legally if others can bypass the system. It's a striking fact that around seven out of 10 of those arriving in small boats last year were men under 40 paying people smugglers to queue jump and taking up our capacity to help genuine women and child refugees.\\n'This is particularly perverse as those attempting crossings are not directly fleeing imminent peril, as is the intended purpose of the asylum system. They pass through manifestly safe countries including many in Europe where they could and should claim asylum.\\n'It's this rank unfairness of a system that can be exploited by gangs which risks eroding public support for the whole concept of asylum.'\\nPriti to face down migrant backlash:\u00a0She's braced for legal challenge from human rights lawyers and Left over new Rwanda deal\\nBy David Barrett, Home Affairs Correspondent in Kigali, Rwanda\\nMinisters are determined to face down what is likely to be a fierce backlash over the plans to tackle the issue of cross-Channel migration.\\nSources said Home Secretary Priti Patel has been 'working night and day' for the last eight months on the agreement with Rwanda, announced tomorrow.\\nIt will see asylum seekers sent to the East African nation for processing or, in some cases, if they are ruled to be economic migrants rather than genuine refugees.\\nIn short, it is designed to have a deterrent effect, and to stop migrants from attempting to enter the UK in the first place.\\nThe Rwanda deal comes after a number of other locations for offshore processing were said to be under consideration by the Home Office.\\nGhana and Albania were\u00a0mooted, along with disused North Sea oil platforms and decommissioned ferries off the UK coast. Ascension Island, part of a UK overseas territory almost 4,500 miles away in the South Atlantic, was also suggested last month.\\nOffshoring asylum seekers will be highly controversial, and even Tory backbenchers have questioned the expense.\\nLast month Conservative former minister Andrew Mitchell said housing asylum seekers at the Ritz hotel would be cheaper than offshoring, claiming the cost to the British taxpayer would be \u00a32million per person, per year.\\nMinisters are also braced for a legal challenge from human rights lawyers \u2013 as well as political opposition from Labour and the Left.\\nFlows of migrants across the Channel have seemed an insoluble challenge since numbers began to rise four years ago.\\nLast year a\u00a0record 28,500 migrants reached British shores aboard dinghies and small boats, with trends appearing to rise yet further so far this year. Ministers will now attempt a different approach \u2013 with a complex international agreement that has taken two years to secure.\\nIn a speech tomorrow, Boris Johnson will defend the new plan, saying that the Government has to control illegal immigration.\\n'We cannot sustain a parallel illegal system. Our compassion may be infinite, but our capacity to help people is not,' he will say.\\n'The British people voted several times to control our borders, not to close them, but to control them.\\n'So just as Brexit allowed us to take back control of legal immigration by replacing free movement with our points-based system, we are also taking back control of illegal immigration, with a long-term plan for asylum in this country.'\\nThe Government's Nationality and Borders Bill will grant the Home Secretary new legal powers to process asylum seekers overseas.\\nThe Bill is yet to complete its final stages in Parliament, and earlier this year the House of Lords voted to remove the offshoring powers, only for them to be later re-instated by a Commons vote.\\nTonight, the initial reaction from charities suggested they would bitterly oppose the plans.\\nEnver Solomon, of the Refugee Council, said: 'We are appalled by the Government's cruel and nasty decision to send those seeking sanctuary in our country to Rwanda.\\n'Offshoring the UK's asylum system will do absolutely nothing to address the reasons why people take perilous journeys to find safety in the UK.\\n'It will do little to deter them from coming to this country, but only lead to more human suffering and chaos.'\\nSteve Valdez-Symonds,\u00a0Amnesty International UK's refugee and migrant rights director, said the 'shockingly ill-conceived idea will go far further in inflicting suffering while wasting huge amounts of public money'.\\nRwanda, with a population of 13million, needs more workers and has in recent years resettled more than 100,000 refugees. In a different approach, the European Union is developing a network of accommodation centre for asylum seekers on a number of Greek islands.\\nThe first \u00a337million facility, on Samos, opened in September and can house 3,000 people in rows of container-style accommodation units.\\nElsewhere, Home Office officials have closely studied a similar scheme for offshore processing which is being set up by Denmark.\\nDanish parliamentarians have approved a change to their law which would allow asylum applications to be considered in a third country. Last year there were reports that it was looking at signing an agreement with the Rwandan government.\\nLuxury life of 'despot' blamed for rights abuses\\nBy Tom Witherow for the Daily Mail\\nThe\u00a0president of Rwanda has won plaudits from former prime ministers Tony Blair and David Cameron despite being branded a 'despot' and blamed for human rights abuses.\\nPaul Kagame, 64, has sold Rwanda as a success story in the developing world over three decades.\\nHe has courted foreign leaders and royalty \u2013 including a 2020 meeting with Prince William at Buckingham Palace \u2013 to win praise as a dynamic and progressive president.\\nHis government has also spent millions of pounds brushing up Rwanda's image by sponsoring Premier League team Arsenal.\\nBut critics claim he is guilty of murderous authoritarianism which has enabled him to remain in power for 28\u00a0years.\\nHe led the militia groups who ended the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, which saw more than 500,000 people massacred.\\nThen US President Bill Clinton said Kagame was 'one of the greatest leaders of our time', Lord Blair called him a 'visionary', and Mr Cameron said his regime was a 'role model for development'.\\nBut in recent years negative stories have over-shadowed his country's economic success.\\nLast December, Paul Rusesabagina \u2013 the inspiration for the hero character in Hollywood film Hotel Rwanda \u2013 was sentenced to 25 years in prison for allegedly founding a terrorist group.\\nHis family branded it a show trial. The former hotel boss-turned-opposition leader had been praised for shielding thousands of potential genocide victims in 1994.\\nBut he criticised Rwanda's human rights abuses after Kagame came to power.\\nKagame's intelligence services have also been suspected of killing critics abroad, but none of the allegations has been proven.\\nWhen arch-critic Colonel Patrick Karegeya was murdered in a hotel in South Africa in 2014, Kagame said: 'When you choose to live like a dog, you die like a dog.'\\nA recent book claimed the Metropolitan Police provided protection for Rwandan opposition figures threatened in London.\\nKagame is known for his luxurious lifestyle and travels in a \u00a350million executive jet and an armour-plated Range Rover worth an estimated \u00a3300,000.\\nHis son Ivan sits on the board of Rwanda's investment agency and lives in a \u00a35million Beverly Hills mansion.\\nQ. Does the new proposal apply only to migrants who arrive on small boats?\\nA. No. It will be enforced on all asylum seekers who arrive by 'irregular routes', including stowaways in the back of lorries, for example.\\nQ. What happens to a migrant boat in the Channel under the plan?\\nA. The Armed Forces took command of the Channel operation yesterday and will be responsible for overseeing the rescue of migrant boats. A wide range of military and civilian assets will be used on the sea and in the air, with up to 300 personnel involved on busy days. Migrants will be brought to Dover, where they will be received by UK Border Force staff backed up by military personnel.\\nQ. Will the military push back any boats to France?\\nA. No. Mr Johnson indicated yesterday that tactic is all but dead. He said 'relying solely on this course of action is simply not practical', although it could be used in 'extremely limited circumstances'. Ministers have been unable to secure agreement with the French to accept migrants back.\\nQ. What will happen once asylum seekers are ashore in Britain?\\nA. They will undergo initial processing at a new centre at a former RAF base in Manston, Kent. They will be screened for 'vulnerability and safeguarding measures' that could prevent them being suitable for removal to Rwanda, and then transferred to temporary accommodation.\\nQ. How will asylum seekers be assessed for removal to Rwanda?\\nA.\u00a0Officials are reluctant to specify assessment criteria, in case it helps people trafficking gangs find loopholes.\\nQ. Are any types of migrant not eligible for the Rwanda scheme?\\nA. Lone children are exempt, and family groups will not be split up.\\nQ. What happens if someone is deemed eligible for removal to Rwanda?\\nA.\u00a0The Government will provide Rwanda with biographical details of each person they want to transfer, as well as any special needs, health issues, security issues and biometric data, if available. Rwanda can refuse individuals for several reasons, such as if they have a criminal record.\\nQ. What happens to the migrants Rwanda agrees to accept?\\nA. They will be given five days' notice that they will be removed to Rwanda. As soon as they are told, they will be taken into immigration detention, over concerns they would abscond. They will then have access to legal advice. The outcome of each case is then likely to be in the hands of the courts.\\nQ. Won't asylum seekers just abscond before a decision has been made?\\nA.\u00a0Possibly. But Home Office officials refused to speculate on the possibility of more people absconding.\\nQ. How will the asylum seekers get to Rwanda?\\nA. The Government will charter planes. The process is costly and controversial. A similar policy to return foreign criminals to Jamaica costs about \u00a314,000 per person.\\nQ. What happens once they arrive in Africa?\\nA.\u00a0Rwanda has arranged accommodation \u2013 including a former tourist hostel on the outskirts of the capital Kigali. The migrants will then be able to apply for asylum, under the local system. The UK will cover Rwanda's costs and fund an extensive support package. Once a decision is made, successful applicants will be given refugee status and be able to 'build a prosperous new life' in the country. If they are refused asylum, they could be offered another immigration status. As a last resort, they could be returned to their country of origin or another safe country.\\nQ. Is the Government's new plan legal?\\nA. Officials say they have taken extensive legal advice, which said the five-year deal with Rwanda complies with international law. However, they are poised for a surge of legal challenges.\\nQ. What could the legal challenges involve?\\nA. Human rights and refugee groups could bring a case for judicial review of the entire policy, or another type of litigation, designed to block it being implemented. Once a decision has been made in court there would most likely be further appeals.\\nQ. How much will the Rwanda plan cost?\\nA.\u00a0Home Secretary Priti Patel and her officials have been extremely coy. They admit a full financial analysis has been conducted \u2013 but refuse to reveal its contents. The asylum system currently costs \u00a31.5 billion a year, and will rise as levels of asylum claims increase.\\nQ. Is the Government looking at sending asylum seekers to other countries?\\nA. Yes.

I'm sure it makes most people think, 'well it can't be that bad'. Unfortunately that's not true. It is that bad and no-one is doing anything on the scale and at the speed we need.\\nUnited Nations scientists have called for an end to the fossil fuel age, as a new report warns immediate action is needed to curb dangerous climate change.\\nMeeting goals agreed by countries to limit temperature rises to 1.5C or below 2C to avoid the worst impacts of climate change requires rapid, deep and immediate greenhouse gas emissions cuts in all areas, a new UN report says.\\nAnd it calls for 'substantial reductions' in the use of fossil fuels to curb emissions.\\nWhile there are signs of action, the world is heading for more than 3C of global warming, scientists from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warn.\\nJim Skea, co-chair of the team behind the report, said the world was 'definitely not on track' to limit warming to 1.5C, beyond which scientists warn increasingly severe floods, droughts, hits to crop yields, rising seas and wildlife die-offs are expected.\\nThe report 'concludes that unless there are immediate and deep emission reductions across all sectors, limiting warming to 1.5C will be beyond reach', he warned.\\nAnd he said: 'We know what to do, we know how to do it, and now it's up to us to take action.'\\nOne of the report's authors, Jan Christoph Minx, from the University of Leeds, said: 'We really need to change course, we need to end the age of fossil fuels and enter an age of climate policy. This has not happened yet.'\\nAs the UN science body released the third part of its sixth assessment report, detailling the solutions to climate change, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres described it as a 'file of shame' of empty pledges made by countries so far, and accused governments of lying over the action they were taking.\\n'Climate promises and plans must be turned into reality and action now. It is time to stop burning our planet and start investing in the abundant renewable energy all around us,' he urged.\\nThe report, which draws on 18,000 studies and sources, pitches scientific findings on climate change into an already heated debate over energy supplies and costs prompted by rising oil and gas prices amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\\nIn the UK, the Government will set out a new energy strategy on Thursday with expectations of support for offshore wind and new nuclear reactors, but not cheap onshore wind, amid clashes over whether to speed up the shift away from oil and gas or boost domestic fossil fuel supplies.\\n'Nothing I have tried so far has made a tiny bit of difference so I am forced to put my whole self out there and hope that the government will listen before it is too late.'\\nShe was referring to the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report released yesterday in which United Nations scientists called for an end to the fossil fuel age and warned immediate action was needed to curb dangerous climate change.\\nClaudia Penna Rojas, 24, a student activist, added: 'The UN Secretary General said yesterday that the world was on a fast track to climate disaster, so why then is the UK government planning to licence over 40 new oil fields?\\n'The reality is that everything good, all that we love, the lives of our children\u2026are all at stake. The need for large-scale, radical civil resistance has never been more urgent. This is the fight for our lives and we all need to be a part of it. It's the only chance we've got.'\\nAnd Miranda Whelehan, 21, a student from Brighton, said: 'The government and the media sell us a lie that it is impossible to stop oil.

Right now, governments are choosing to exploit the crisis in Ukraine to hand out oil licences and continue the fossil fuel economy that's destroying us.\\n'The reality is, the UK public wants faster action on climate as the energy crisis hits.

Louis has said he has received 'hundreds' of death threats since running on to the pitch.\\nMcKechnie is a Bournemouth University student whose activism began with\u00a0Extinction Rebellion (XR) in 2020 before he joined vegan group Animal Rebellion.\\nThe 21-year-old, whose experience of work appears to be only stints with a local fish-and-chip shop and supermarket, was one of the 'Highway Nine' Insulate Britain protesters jailed for blocking the M25 last year.\\nAfter serving half of a three-month prison sentence, he warned: 'What comes next will make Insulate Britain look like child's play.'\\nRebel reverend: Tim Hewes\\nReverend Hewes, who once sewed up his lips in protest at the influence of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, was also repeatedly part of the mob blocking the M25 despite already being arrested numerous times.\\nThe activist has 'permission to officiate' in the Diocese of Oxford although he does not have a parish, and is today in tunnels under an oil tanker route.\\nAsked about Rev Hewes last year, a spokesman for the diocese said: 'The actions of Rev Hewes and others, while arguably well-intentioned, have frustrated many people and we're unclear how the actions have been productive in encouraging the urgent change required.'\\nRev Hewes, a retired dentist, previously said the Bishop of Dorchester, Gavin Collins, who comes under the Diocese of Oxford, had told him 'he does support issues regarding climate change and the environment but not about breaking the law'.\\nToday he is in a tunnel under a key tanker route to the BP Kingsbury Terminal in Warwickshire.\\nHe said: 'I'm here because our government is useless, they make a lot of noise but they are doing nothing.\\n'As a priest I have a duty of care for people, and also for creation. What I'm doing here, with everyone in this caravan, is what our government should be doing \u2013 that is trying to protect our families and our loved ones from the appalling future that stands before us.\\n'I hope we can continue what we're doing and stop the flow of oil, if the government won't.'\\nThe jetsetting yachtswoman: Hannah Hunt\\nThe JSO protester is from Brighton, a common home town for Green zealots.\\nMiss Hunt is a former XR supporter who broke into an ExxonMobil Oil refinery in Hampshire. She also posed with Mr\u00a0McKechnie outside Downing Street with a letter for Boris Johnson.\\nShe also glued herself to the red carpet at the Bafta awards and admits to experiencing severe anxiety before a protest. But describing her state after starting she said she enjoys 'a weird, dreamy, calm mindset' she finds empowering.\\nThe Brighton-based activist studied at Sussex University, where she joined the sailing team. Her Instagram shows her holidaying in locations including Australia, Greece, Gran Canaria and Bali.\\nShe is currently in the rafters of the Grays refinery, with\u00a0Eben Lazarus, a musician and activist also from Brighton.\u00a0Sharing a video she said they were 'cold and uncomfortable' 17 hours into their protest, but added: 'But that suffering is minute compared to those in the frontline of the climate crisis'.\\nEben then encourages people to 'step up' and join protests because 'nobody can be a bystander if we want any chance of a future'.\\nXR's 'arts-co-ordinator': Indigo Rumbelow\\nEco-fanatic Indigo Rumbelow, 27, from Gower, South-West Wales, has been arrested at least five times. In a Zoom call watched by The Mail on Sunday last week, she told activists: 'We want to create sustained disruption for two weeks.'\\nDescribing her motivations, Miss Rumbelow said: 'My generation is being forced into action because our Government is destroying our future. We will immediately end all actions when it makes a statement that it will stop all new oil and gas.'\\nIndigo was first arrested at Cannes Lions Advertising Festival in 2019 for gate-crashing a Facebook conference and has been held by police on at least six occasions since then.\\nIn 2020 she began digging up the lawn in front of the Ministry for Housing Communities and Local Government and was arrested again in Parliament Square later that year when she blocked the road.\\nJustifying her behaviour recently she said: 'The only thing to do in a system that is driving itself to extinction is to rebel. If we look at the history books, we can see that the only way of creating the nonlinear change we need is for people to commit civil disobedience and force that change.\\n'Currently too few people are taking the necessary action. I urge anyone reading this article to realise that they too can rebel. In order to prevent ecosystem and societal collapse, at this pivotal moment in history, ordinary people need to take extra-ordinary action'.\\nThe rollerskating watchmaker: Amy Rugg-Easey\\nMiss Rugg-Easey was involved in shutting down Tower Bridge last Friday.\\nShe and an unnamed man threw themselves off the bridge using abseil ropes and tiers a giant 'End fossil fuels now' banner.\\nThe Labour-voting voting watchmaker and rollerskater from Newcastle upon Tyne describes herself as a 'rebel for life'.\\nDescribing her descent into eco-activism she said: 'I quit my career in watchmaking to study environmental science after listening to science podcasts while working at my bench. I remember thinking at the time 'it can't be that bad'. Climate change was something that you heard about every now again in the news as if it was the weather. When I really started to look at the facts, I started to panic. I felt a need to do something about it.\\nWhen I began my degree, I had already been to a few Extinction Rebellion meetings and their famous 'heading for extinction' talk. 'It can't be that bad' I thought. I'd hoped that when I started studying, the things I would learn would show that that talk had been a huge exaggeration. Unfortunately, that was not the case'.\\nDescribing the abseiling stunt she said: 'I was terrified stepping off that bridge. I decided to put my name out and wear my signature blue jacket hoping that people I've met would recognise me and realise that climate activists are just normal people too. I also know that it creates a target on my back. Certain people will wish that I'd died on that bridge today. I know that it makes my mum worry.\\n'I'm hoping my actions inspires others to be brave and take their first steps in fighting for our future. Not everyone has to hang off a bridge and get arrested, but everyone has to take meaningful action for things to change'.\\nThe Cambridge music student:\u00a0Cressie Gethin\\nMiss Gethin, a former student of the prestigious\u00a0Hereford Cathedral School, is currently among the group holding up the Grays refinery.\u00a0She appears to be one of the five main founders of Just Stop Oil.\\nCressie, a music student from Murray Edwards at Cambridge University, has been campaigning on climate issues at her college.\\nShe told The Tab: 'I was very very surprised that Murray Edwards came out bottom of the league tables for their climate policies because I had imagined it was something they would have cared about and been active on'.\\nThe talented chorister has performed with her brother, also a singer.\\nThe LBC mic gluer:\u00a0Nathan McGovern\\n22-year-old King's College London student Nathan McGovern, who studies religion. The Coventry activist has flirted with XR and Animal Rebellion and disrupted a game at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\\nEight days ago he was speaking to Tom Swarbrick in LBC's Westminster studio when he glued his hand to the microphone at around 11.40am.\\nMr McGovern said that the station was 'not using' its 'massive platform' to inform listeners of the dangers of the climate crisis\\nSpeaking live, Mr McGovern said to Mr Swarbrick: 'You have a massive platform, a microphone that you can use to tell people about the situation we're in and you're not using it.\\n'An ordinary person like me is having to take the microphone and tell your viewers the situation we are in.'\\nThe LBC presenter said: 'For those of you listening wondering what the banging on the microphone is, Mr McGovern seems to have, you've glued yourself to the microphone? That's fantastic.'\\nAfter the incident, LBC presenter and Daily Mail columnist Andrew Pierce took over the live programme from Global's Leicester Square, before handing back to Mr Swarbrick when arrived there.\\nDuring this time, Mc McGovern was left in the studio in the dark while waiting for police to arrive.\\nHe appeared as a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion advocating a 'plant-based food system' on Nigel Farage's GB News show in October 2021.\\nAfter the disruption, the group tweeted: 'Every new oil and gas facility tightens the noose around the necks of our young people. If the media will not communicate their predicament they will have no choice but to take the microphone.'\\nJust Stop Oil's official 'de-escalator':\u00a0Pavel Ivanov\\nMr Ivanov is billed as an expert in diffusing rows that break out at the protests when JSO's members shut down roads, for example.\\nSpeaking to The Guardian he described the 'astonishing' abuse they suffer, in a tacit admission that they are struggling to win over many of their critics.\\nIn one incident linked to the blockading of oil refineries, one driver who had protesters on his roof said: 'If the police weren't here, I'd come up and f**king throw you off myself.'\\nAnother activist with a ladder was told: 'You put that up there, mate, and I'm going to ram it down your f**king throat'.\\nMr Ivanov claims n one occasion someone got him by the throat as friends were heckled: 'You look like you're just out of nappies. Go and get a f**king job'.\\nJSO's graphic designer who won't have a baby until she tries to 'fix the world':\u00a0\u00a0Gabriella Ditton\\nAnother JSO activist is graphic designer Gabriella Ditton, 27, from Norfolk, who was arrested for blocking oil trucks on Friday.\\nIn a newspaper interview, Ms Ditton \u2013 who attended Wymondham College in Norfolk, where annual boarding fees are more than \u00a312,000 \u2013 bragged: 'I've been arrested 16 times and it's honestly fine.' She has stripped naked and covered her body in oil at protests.\\nThe group said last week: 'Gabriella would love nothing more than to have a family and continue her career as a graphic designer, but feels those things aren't an option for her anymore because of the state of the world'.\\nThe 27-year-old, who works as an animator, became hooked after going to an Extinction Rebellion talk. She said: 'I was getting my life in order to have a baby and went to the Heading for Extinction talk. I realised I couldn't bring a baby into the world before trying to fix it first.\\n'I started the way everyone does, with petitions, emailing my MP, going on marches. But I realised it doesn't work. In the future, I want to be able to say with total sincerity that I did everything I could and really mean it. I'm so frightened about society falling apart \u2013 I'm so deadly terrified that I will do literally anything to prevent it from happening'.\\nOrganic farmer and XR co-founder who branded the Holocaust 'just another f**kery in human history':\u00a0Roger Hallam\\nRoger Hallam is the co-founder of Extinction Rebellion who believes paralysing traffic will eventually cause food shortages and trigger uprisings.\\nHe once stood unsuccessfully in the 2019 European Parliament election in the London constituency as an independent, winning 924 of the 2,241,681 votes cast, which was around 0.04 per cent of the vote.\\nHe became interested in climate change in his 40s when an organic farm he ran in south Wales went bankrupt because of extreme weather conditions.\\nHallam went on hunger strike in 2017 to demand King's College London stop investing in fossil fuels. His stated ambition for the group is to 'bring down all the regimes in the world and replace them', starting with Britain.\\nHe encouraged his followers to get arrested at demonstrations en-masse as a way of raising awareness of climate change.\\nIn a recent video on YouTube, he said protesters should be ready to cause disruption through personal 'sacrifice'. If necessary, they 'should be willing to die'.\\nIn 2019 he apologised for comments he made describing the Holocaust as 'just another f**kery in human history'.\\nHallam, 55, sparked outrage in Germany yesterday by comparing the murder of six million Jewish people at the hands of the Nazis to other historical massacres and claiming that the memory of the Shoah - or Holocaust - was holding Germany back.\\nThe former organic farmer was quickly condemned by Extinction Rebellion groups in Germany, as well as the German government after his comments to a newspaper in the country", "image": [["Activists from Extinction Rebellion outside the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in London today", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/13/12/56564329-10714353-image-a-233_1649850822961.jpg"], ["Video shared by XR shows two people with their hands down on a reception desk with a Shell sign visible in the background", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/13/14/56568335-10714353-image-a-8_1649856788547.jpg"], ["Pictured: In the video, one of the protesters says: 'We are here to talk to HR, because we feel like there is not much point in talking to people at a corporation like this because those people clearly have not got any idea what is going on.'", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/13/14/56568329-10714353-image-a-11_1649856821004.jpg"], ["Pictures show three people holding a sign saying: 'Insiders wanted', at the reception of Shell HQ building in London today", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/13/14/56568505-10714353-image-a-13_1649857157476.jpg"], ["Police formed a barrier to stop more activists entering Shell HQ in London after protesters managed to infiltrate the building", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/13/14/56568507-10714353-image-a-15_1649857531953.jpg"], ["Pictured: Police carry away an activist from Extinction Rebellion who glued herself to the reception of the Shell building", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/13/16/56573925-10714353-image-a-71_1649864983742.jpg"], ["Police take a break from carrying away an activist from Extinction Rebellion who glued herself to reception of the Shell HQ", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/13/16/56573921-10714353-image-a-74_1649865004564.jpg"], ["Police lead away an activist from XR who glued herself to the reception of the Shell building on the Southbank in London", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/13/16/56573923-10714353-image-a-75_1649865032145.jpg"], ["Police lead away an activist from Extinction Rebellion who glued himself to the reception of the Shell building in London", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/20/16/56573905-10714353-Police_lead_away_an_activist_from_Extinction_Rebellion_who_glued-a-14_1650469675612.jpg"], ["Activists glue themselves to an entrance at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in London today", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/13/12/56564347-10714353-image-a-239_1649850887408.jpg"], ["Activists from Extinction Rebellion hold placards at an entrance to the Business Department in London today", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/13/12/56564327-10714353-image-a-234_1649850826684.jpg"], ["Activists glue themselves to an entrance at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in London today", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/13/12/56564333-10714353-image-a-237_1649850884442.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/13/13/56565301-10714353-image-a-253_1649852535176.jpg"], ["Demonstrators from Extinction Rebellion walk along Constitution Hill towards Buckingham Palace in London this afternoon", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/13/13/56564831-10714353-image-a-240_1649851210262.jpg"], ["Just Stop Oil launch further action today as they glue themselves to roads and climb on top of oil tankers in Purfleet, Essex", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/13/09/56557095-10714353-Eco_mob_Just_Stop_Oil_have_launched_a_12th_day_of_action_by_glue-a-103_1649838718978.jpg"], ["Just Stop Oil protesters sit on a road in Purfleet, Essex, this morning.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman yesterday insisted the Government will not tolerate continued disruption.\\nThe mayhem comes ahead of a record 21.5million motorists preparing to take to the roads this coming Easter weekend.

We'll be out of everything in the next 20 minutes.'\\nIt comes as the AA today pleaded with drivers to fill up their cars as normal and to avoid rushing to petrol stations - even if they see that their local garages are closed on social media.\\nA spokesperson told MailOnline: 'If you have half a tank, just wait until tomorrow or Monday to fill it up, there's no need to rush to the station.\\n'If your station is closed, you will probably find another one near you that isn't.'\\nHe added: 'While the blockades have undoubtedly had an impact, the closures appear to be localised and not nationwide.\\n'The only impact they've had so far is the equivalent of a bad storm, the fuel industry is more than capable of dealing with such disruptions.\\n'The great thing about oil tankers is that they're mobile and can simply unload at other ports which aren't being targeted.'\\nThe spokesman said the closures have been partly caused by the fact that it is the weekend, particularly as families are looking to get away for Easter.\\nHe urged people not to panic if they see a picture of a closed petrol station on social media.\\n'The blockaders want to make the whole system fall down,' he said, 'they want to see petrol stations run out of fuel by making people rush to fill up their cars.\\n'While they have had some impact, the fuel deliveries eventually get through.'\\nClimate protestors Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion teamed up to blockade key terminals this week, meaning some tanker drivers are not able to deliver fuel to station depots.\\nThey say they want to disrupt fuel supplies to London and the South East of England and will continue until the Government agrees to stop all new fossil fuel investments.\\nThe protests are exacerbating existing supply issues due to increased demand after Covid lockdowns and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\\nIt comes as working Britons face a hike in National Insurance, and soaring food and energy prices as Boris Johnson admitted families face 'tough times' and will have to 'choose' where to cut back spending.\\nAnd from today, the group are planning new 'rebellions' which will start at London's Hyde Park and then spread throughout the capital - saying that they will be 'impossible to ignore'.\\n'We are getting a lot of reports to us and on social media of fuel shortages across the country,' they told MailOnline.\\nWhen asked about the chaos caused by the group's protests, the spokesperson said they felt 'no choice but to act' to pressure the government into cutting off Britain's reliance on fuel.\\n'The Government can end the misery of empty filling stations immediately by making a statement to end new oil and gas,' they said.\\nSeveral of the ports most affected are in Essex where people have been attaching themselves to fuel tankers with glue and bike locks.\\nExtinction Rebellion protesters have shut down Tower Bridge by abseiling off the sides of the London landmark.\\nTwo activists are hanging from the bridge by suspension cords and have unfurled a huge banner that reads: 'End fossil fuels now.'\\nThe bridge, a main traffic artery across the Thames, is closed to vehicles, causing long queues.\\nThe pair hung the banner at 7am on Friday and also released red flares.\\nThe Metropolitan Police said officers were called to the bridge at 7.30am and no arrests have been made.\\nExtinction Rebellion said: 'The action has taken place at the gateway to the City of London - the root source of fossil fuel funding in the UK - and on the eve of the April Rebellion which begins tomorrow at 10am in Hyde Park.'\\nAmy Rugg-Easey, who is taking part in the demonstration, said: 'I ask myself why I do these things all the time, and the main thing that drives me is that I have tremendous hope and optimism in humanity's ability to fight the climate crisis - but there are certain people who continue to prevent that for their own profit.\\nChafford Hundred, West Thurrock and the Purfleet Fuels Terminals are among the\u00a010 'critical' sites that have been blocked across the country.\\nThe operation has cost more than \u00a31 million since last Friday, according to Essex's Deputy Chief Constable Andy Prophet, and more protestors have continued to arrive.\\nBy Friday, some 268 people have now been arrested by Essex Police alone.\\nSeven of the ten protests were carried out by Just Stop Oil at Navigator Terminals Thames, Inter Terminals UK and Purfleet Fuels Terminal all in Grays; Buncefield Oil Depot in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire; Esso Petroleum in Tyburn, Birmingham; and Kingsbury Oil Terminal and BP Oil Depot, both in Tamworth, Staffordshire.\\nThe further three were organised by Extinction Rebellion demonstrators at the Esso West Terminal near London Heathrow Airport, Hamble Terminals in Southampton and Hythe Terminal in Fawley, Hampshire.\\nIn a tweet by Extinction Rebellion's Cambridge branch the group shared photos of fuel 'running dry across Cambridge'.\\n'@JustStop_Oil and @XRebellionUK are blockading oil terminals across the UK.\\n'Shown here are petrol stations in Sainsbury's Coldhams Lane, Tesco Fulbourn, and BP Elizabeth Way and Cherry Hinton.'\\nThe Petrol Retailers Association said: 'We are aware of protests at a number of fuel supply sites; however the majority of terminals are currently unaffected.\\n'PRA has not had any members contacting regarding supply issues. Some fuel suppliers are having to reschedule deliveries and our members are working closely with them and following their advice.'\\nFuel prices have risen to record highs in recent weeks, with some garages and forecourts charging more than \u00a32/litre for diesel at one point.\\nChancellor Rishi Sunak tried to mitigate the effects of price rises as he last month begged petrol stations to pass on a 5p fuel duty cut at the pumps that he delivered in his Spring Statement.\\nAsda, Sainsburys and Tesco were among the major supermarkets to confirm they would pass on the cut in prices, with a 6p decrease in petrol and diesel.\\nThis however represents only a fraction in the price rises seen since the Russian invasion of Ukraine\u00a0 in late February.\\nThe 5p cut in fuel duty was blasted by UK motoring groups as a 'drop in the ocean' for hard-pressed drivers as pump prices continue to hit record levels.\\nFrom this weekend it is believed the groups' focus will shift towards\u00a0'mass daily protests' in London to be led by Extinction Rebellion activists.\\nThe campaign group, also known as XR, will hold its latest 'rebellions' from April 9 starting at Hyde Park and then spreading throughout the capital.\\nProtests are also planned in Birmingham and Southampton and 'non-violent direct action training' will be given.\\nXR spokesman Andrew Smith said: 'From Saturday April 9 we will meet at 10am in Hyde Park every day. We will be easy to find, we will be easy to join, we will be more disruptive than ever, and we will be impossible to ignore.\\n'We're expecting huge numbers from the 9th. In London we won't have pink boats, we won't have pink tables, we will just have people power.\\n'In the tradition of non-violent civil disobedience, we will disrupt business as usual until the Government and big business make change. We need everyone to join us.'\\nHe continued: 'We're looking at more mass participation-style events, rather than small kind of scattergun actions which rebellions have previously consisted of. We're looking at mass participation, which are easy to join.\\n'We're asking the public to step up and join us.\u00a0We know at the moment that across the country, people are feeling kind of disenfranchised with how they've been treated by the Government.\\n'The energy crisis is really starting to hit home on people, and people really want us to step up into a space where their voice is heard.\\n'We're offering them the space where they can come and participate and join with us.\\n'Every morning we'll be offering non-violent direct action training, where we will encourage people to step up and be empowered to take action with us and speak out against Government inaction.\u00a0As a response to that, the actions will feel and look very different to previous rebellions.", "image": [["Extinction Rebellion climate activists are staging a sit-down protest which has brought Regent Street and Oxford Street to a standstill", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/09/17/56410817-10702883-Extinction_Rebellion_climate_activists_are_staging_a_sit_down_pr-a-1_1649521007738.jpg"], ["Climate activists from Extinction Rebellion carry placards and a banner reading 'We will not be bystanders' as they take part in a demonstration in London earlier today", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/09/17/56413069-10702883-image-a-53_1649522829346.jpg"], ["Canoeist Etienne Stott (pictured outside the city of London Magistrates' Court in January 2020), who won the slalom event with Tim Baillie at the London 2012 Olympic Games,\u00a0was convicted of a public order offence after Extinction Rebellion protests in 2019, when he was arrested on Waterloo Bridge with other demonstrators after they refused to comply with conditions imposed by police", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/09/18/56413797-10702883-image-a-65_1649524591899.jpg"], ["Extinction Rebellion climate protesters sit in the road at Oxford Circus during a sit-down demonstration.

He was jailed last year after repeatedly blocking the M25 with the Insulate Britain mob.\\nInjunctions against them would mirror those used last year to ban IB fanatics from blocking roads, allowing police to make arrests more easily - but critics have accused Ms Patel of not being quick enough to act to neuter them.\\nBut history appears to be repeating itself amid a revolving door of activists being arrested and then released to cause more havoc - despite the group crippling critical UK infrastructure and leaving petrol stations without fuel.\\nAttorney General Suella Braverman met with cabinet members last night to draw up plans with local councils so they can target specific protesters. Injunctions will be served against them 'within days', according to the Daily Telegraph.\\nRingleader McKechnie, 21, said in a video that the men were being cut down at the Grays oil depot in Essex last night and were the 'last standing'. MailOnline has learned he and Nathan McGovern, 22, were arrested at 9pm last night after 40 hours in the rafters.\\nIn a previous video, McKechnie and McGovern said that they had chained themselves to pipes high up at the site on Sunday afternoon.\\nMcGovern, who studies religion, has previously attempted to tie himself to a goalpost during a match between West Ham and Tottenham and also glued his hand to a microphone during a heated exchange on LBC last weekend.\\nEngineering student McKechnie has also disrupted a football game - between Everton and Newcastle last month.\\nMcKechnie was one of the 'Highway Nine' Insulate Britain\u00a0protesters jailed for blocking the M25 last year and served a three month prison sentence.\\nFigures compiled by the Business Department show that average fuel stock levels at forecourts in England dropped by 5.4 per cent to 36 per cent in the week the Just Stop Oil protests began on March 28.\\nJust Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion activists \u2013 many of them young, middle-class students \u2013 have targeted 11 fuel depots in as many days, blocking trucks from making petrol\u00a0and diesel deliveries to forecourts.\\nThree terminals were targeted over the weekend and trucks had been unable to access the Exolum storage facility in Grays, Essex, after protesters glued themselves to pipes above loading bays.\\nIt came after Downing Street accused the eco-activists of using 'guerilla tactics that obstruct people going about their day-to-day business' and promised a crackdown.\\nIn the strongest statement yet on the eco-mob 'Just Stop Oil', Number 10 yesterday pledged that it would 'not tolerate' those\u00a0obstructing people 'going about their day-to-day business'.\\nResponding to Just Stop Oil's tactics, a No 10 spokeswoman said: 'We recognise the strength of feeling and the right to protest is a cornerstone of our democracy, but we won't tolerate guerrilla tactics that obstruct people going about their day-to-day business.'\\nThe spokeswoman added: 'We fully support the police who are putting significant resource into their response to the demonstrations.'\\nIt came as a furious motorist yesterday revealed how they had to drive 46 miles to fill up because of the disruption to the UK's petrol supplies, while others said they did not have enough fuel to go to work.\\nOne driver, recounting their nightmare journey, told MailOnline:\u00a0'Every petrol station we tried was shut - we drove 11 miles to Aylesbury first and then 17 miles to Bicester before giving up and driving the ten miles back home.\\n'The next day we drove to Winslow which is another eight miles away before finding fuel there. It is total pot luck'.\\nBritain was left in the grips of another fuel crisis, with petrol stations forced to close due to the disruption caused at oil terminals.\\nAround 1,200 pumps south of the midlands were forced to turn away motorists, the Campaign for Fair Fuel claimed on Sunday, in the wake of the action by Just Stop Oil.\\nThe eco protestors have been targeting oil terminals across the south of the country, including in Hertfordshire, Essex and Warwickshire by locking themselves to pipes.\\nThe action has been blamed for shortages of both petrol and diesel at stations compounding misery for drivers already facing record prices at the pump, reported at over \u00a32 a litre in some areas.\\nPriti Patel has called the protesters 'selfish, fanatical and frankly dangerous' while George Eustice, the Environment Secretary, criticised their 'extreme' tactics.\\nCampaign group Fair Fuel said up to a third of petrol stations were closed, while pictures showed some remained shut yesterday.\\nFair Fuel founder Howard Cox told MailOnline supplies remained 'patchy' - with diesel particularly affected - but overall the situation was better than on the weekend.\\nThe AA said that shortages had been 'isolated' and none of its 2,700 patrols had experienced difficulties getting fuel.\\nMeanwhile, the Petrol Retailers Association, which represents around 65% of independently owned forecourts, said:\u00a0'We are aware of protests at several fuel supply sites; however, the majority are unaffected.'\\nSupply issues tend to hit motorists in London and the South East worse than elsewhere.\\nThis is most likely due to the regions' higher population densities, Gordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retailers Association, has previously said.\\nCampaign group Just Stop Oil was on its eleventh day of disruptive protests.\\nA video posted at 3.30am yesterday morning showed one activist at Grays oil depot filming a selfie video from inside a pipe.\\n'We're still in the pipes, still stopping oil, still stopping whatever we non-violently can to resist the collapse of our liveable future,' he said.\\n'We really hope to make it to 24 hours and beyond because that's the only way this government will listen.\\n'This corrupt government that is pushing us towards not just a climate catastrophe but a social crisis.\\n'We're in the depths of a cost of living emergency... we're in the depths of a legitimacy crisis and unless Boris Johnson gets on with the job and stops oil and legitimacy crisis will extend to the entire global system'.\\nYesterday, Environment Secretary George Eustice said: 'A right to protest is important but not if it's causing havoc with other people's lives. That's wrong and not acceptable.\\n'We all recognise that we need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels... this is a mainstream agenda, people really don't need to do these extreme protests to get their point heard.'\\nMass protests have resulted in more than 800 arrests across the country and have put a 'real strain' on local police services.\\nThe protests are exacerbating existing supply issues due to increased demand after Covid lockdowns and Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\\nThe Insulate Britain injunctions, applied for at the High Court by roads agency National Highways, effectively banned protests on major roads.\\nIt meant activists could be arrested for contempt of court for breaking the injunctions.\\nLabour said ministers should work with local authorities covering the country's 60-odd oil terminals to bring in similar measures. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman yesterday insisted the Government will not tolerate continued disruption.\\nThe mayhem comes ahead of a record 21.5million motorists preparing to take to the roads this coming Easter weekend. Steve Reed, Labour's justice spokesman, said: 'The Conservatives need to stop standing idly by and put an end to this disruption that is causing misery for motorists.'\\nHe said: 'We recognise the strength of feeling and that the right to protest is a cornerstone of our democracy, but we won't tolerate guerrilla tactics that obstruct people going about their day-to-day business.'\\nEssex Police made nine more arrests yesterday, following 26 on Sunday.\\nAssistant Chief Constable Rachel Nolan blasted the 'totally unacceptable' activists who have trespassed into areas holding flammable chemicals.\\nShe said: 'Their risky behaviour cannot be allowed to take place in such critical locations which could be catastrophic if there were accidental or deliberate actions causing leakage or fire.' Just Stop Oil is an off-shoot of Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion and contains many of the same members.\\nMinisters had planned to introduce new powers to help police tackle eco-protesters but the measures were blocked in the House of Lords in January.\\nAt the time, Miss Patel accused Labour of siding with 'vandals and thugs'.\\nProposed measures had included an offence of 'locking on' in a bid to stop protesters resorting to the common tactic of chaining themselves to buildings and vehicles.\\nNew stop and search powers were also proposed to allow police to detain protesters arriving carrying bike locks and other equipment designed to make themselves difficult to remove.\\nMinisters are expected to try to revive the measures in the next Queen's Speech.\\nJust Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion fanatics claimed to have dug a tunnel under a tankerroute in a bid to block deliveries to forecourts.\\nThe West Midlands and East of England were the worst affected regions, with average stocks finishing the week ending April 3 on 25 per cent.\\nA spokesman for the UK Petroleum Industry Association, whose members include Shell, BP and ExxonMobil, said disruptions are 'localised and short-term only'.\\nA government spokesman said: 'We are working closely with industry to ensure that supplies are maintained.'\\nThe green zealots trying to make Britain run out of fuel are a bunch of privileged students and professional protesters, MailOnline can reveal today.\\nActivists from Just Stop Oil have been hampering access to petrol and diesel for days, demanding that the Government stops new fossil fuel projects by digging tunnels below refineries, vandalising tankers or storming the terminals to climb on to the pipes.\\nEssex Police has arrested more than 350 protesters since the disruption started on April 1 - while queues have formed at petrol stations across the country and some have even shut down due to a shortage of fuel.\\nOne of the ringleaders is 'John Lennon lookalike' Louis McKechnie, a Bournemouth University graduate who became a poster boy for JSO after he tied himself to a goalpost to disrupt a Premier League\u00a0game at Everton last month.\\nAround\u00a012 students remain within the pipes at Grays Inter Terminal today, including former boarding school choir girl and now Cambridge University student Cressie\u00a0Gethin. With her in the rafters is\u00a0student Nathan McGovern, another golden boy of the movement.\\nAlso manning the barricades are Brighton-based activist Hannah Hunt, 23, another student with a taste for expensive hobbies and travel, and Eben Lazarus, who describes himself as a 'musician and activist'.\\nAnd in the tunnels below the BP Kingsbury Oil Terminal in Warwickshire is retired vicar Tim Hewes, a veteran of the Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain movement who also sewed his lips together in protest against Rupert Murdoch.\\nOther members of the Just Stop Oil group, which is closely linked to the Extinction Rebellion, Animal Rebellion and Insulate Britain groups, is a rollerskating watchmaker and JSO's official 'de-escalator', XR's 'arts co-ordinator' and a Welsh organic farmer whose family business failed and he blamed climate change.\\nThese are the protesters at the heart of the current chaos that is leaving millions of Britons short on fuel:\\nThe Lennon-lookalike posterboy: Louis McKechnie\\nLouis McKechnie, 21, an engineering student, was charged with pitch encroachment and aggravated trespass after the incident at Goodison Park during the game between Everton and Newcastle United last month.\\nHe stormed the pitch halfway through the match and zip-tied himself to the goalpost wearing a bright orange t-shirt saying: 'Just stop oil.' Louis has said he has received 'hundreds' of death threats since running on to the pitch.\\nMcKechnie is a Bournemouth University student whose activism began with\u00a0Extinction Rebellion (XR) in 2020 before he joined vegan group Animal Rebellion.\\nThe 21-year-old, whose experience of work appears to be only stints with a local fish-and-chip shop and supermarket, was one of the 'Highway Nine' Insulate Britain protesters jailed for blocking the M25 last year.\\nAfter serving half of a three-month prison sentence, he warned: 'What comes next will make Insulate Britain look like child's play.'\\nPharmaceuticals expert's daughter who grew up in \u00a31million house: Miranda Whelehan\\nMiranda Whelehan was among around 20 activists from Just Stop Oil who blocked tankers arriving at Kingsbury oil terminal in Warwickshire.\\nAn undergraduate in International Development with French at the University of Sussex, she is the daughter of a cyber-security expert at multinational pharmaceuticals firm GSK and grew up in a \u00a31million five-bedroom house in Weybridge, Surrey.\\nMiss Whelehan appeared on Good Morning Britain yesterday attempting to justify the protests.\\nQuizzed by presenter Richard Madeley, she insisted that 'I don't think any of us want to be disrupting people's lives'.\\nBut she said that 'given the science', it was 'the level of action that needs to be taken when our Government is failing on their energy policies and their climate pledges'.\\nThe interview threatened to descend into farce when Madeley suggested the group's name was 'very Vicky Pollard' and 'childish'.\\nIn response, she argued that its demand was simple - for ministers to say 'no to new oil'.\\nHowever some viewers complained his questioning had become 'bullying' after he began pointing out that the clothes she was wearing would probably have been delivered to the shops in vans or lorries.\\nLater, while accepting that civil disobedience were 'not popular', she insisting that future generations would regard them as 'heroic'.\\n'What we must do now is block and disable the cogs of the fossil-fuel machine,' she wrote in the Independent.\\nRebel reverend: Tim Hewes\\nReverend Hewes, who once sewed up his lips in protest at the influence of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, was also repeatedly part of the mob blocking the M25 despite already being arrested numerous times.\\nThe activist has 'permission to officiate' in the Diocese of Oxford although he does not have a parish, and is today in tunnels under an oil tanker route.\\nAsked about Rev Hewes last year, a spokesman for the diocese said: 'The actions of Rev Hewes and others, while arguably well-intentioned, have frustrated many people and we're unclear how the actions have been productive in encouraging the urgent change required.'\\nRev Hewes, a retired dentist, previously said the Bishop of Dorchester, Gavin Collins, who comes under the Diocese of Oxford, had told him 'he does support issues regarding climate change and the environment but not about breaking the law'.\\nToday he is in a tunnel under a key tanker route to the BP Kingsbury Terminal in Warwickshire.\\nHe said: 'I'm here because our government is useless, they make a lot of noise but they are doing nothing.\\n'As a priest I have a duty of care for people, and also for creation. What I'm doing here, with everyone in this caravan, is what our government should be doing \u2013 that is trying to protect our families and our loved ones from the appalling future that stands before us.\\n'I hope we can continue what we're doing and stop the flow of oil, if the government won't.'\\nThe jetsetting yachtswoman: Hannah Hunt\\nThe JSO protester is from Brighton, a common home town for Green zealots.\\nMiss Hunt is a former XR supporter who broke into an ExxonMobil Oil refinery in Hampshire. She also posed with Mr\u00a0McKechnie outside Downing Street with a letter for Boris Johnson.\\nShe also glued herself to the red carpet at the Bafta awards and admits to experiencing severe anxiety before a protest. But describing her state after starting she said she enjoys 'a weird, dreamy, calm mindset' she finds empowering.\\nThe Brighton-based activist studied at Sussex University, where she joined the sailing team. Her Instagram shows her holidaying in locations including Australia, Greece, Gran Canaria and Bali.\\nShe is currently in the rafters of the Grays refinery, with\u00a0Eben Lazarus, a musician and activist also from Brighton.\u00a0Sharing a video she said they were 'cold and uncomfortable' 17 hours into their protest, but added: 'But that suffering is minute compared to those in the frontline of the climate crisis'.\\nEben then encourages people to 'step up' and join protests because 'nobody can be a bystander if we want any chance of a future'.\\nXR's 'arts-co-ordinator': Indigo Rumbelow\\nEco-fanatic Indigo Rumbelow, 27, from Gower, South-West Wales, has been arrested at least five times. In a Zoom call watched by The Mail on Sunday last week, she told activists: 'We want to create sustained disruption for two weeks.'\\nDescribing her motivations, Miss Rumbelow said: 'My generation is being forced into action because our Government is destroying our future. We will immediately end all actions when it makes a statement that it will stop all new oil and gas.'\\nIndigo was first arrested at Cannes Lions Advertising Festival in 2019 for gate-crashing a Facebook conference and has been held by police on at least six occasions since then.\\nIn 2020 she began digging up the lawn in front of the Ministry for Housing Communities and Local Government and was arrested again in Parliament Square later that year when she blocked the road.\\nJustifying her behaviour recently she said: 'The only thing to do in a system that is driving itself to extinction is to rebel. If we look at the history books, we can see that the only way of creating the nonlinear change we need is for people to commit civil disobedience and force that change.\\n'Currently too few people are taking the necessary action. I urge anyone reading this article to realise that they too can rebel. In order to prevent ecosystem and societal collapse, at this pivotal moment in history, ordinary people need to take extra-ordinary action'.\\nThe rollerskating watchmaker: Amy Rugg-Easey\\nMiss Rugg-Easey was involved in shutting down Tower Bridge last Friday.\\nShe and an unnamed man threw themselves off the bridge using abseil ropes and tiers a giant 'End fossil fuels now' banner.\\nThe Labour-voting voting watchmaker and rollerskater from Newcastle upon Tyne describes herself as a 'rebel for life'.\\nDescribing her descent into eco-activism she said: 'I quit my career in watchmaking to study environmental science after listening to science podcasts while working at my bench. I remember thinking at the time 'it can't be that bad'. Climate change was something that you heard about every now again in the news as if it was the weather. When I really started to look at the facts, I started to panic. I felt a need to do something about it.\\nWhen I began my degree, I had already been to a few Extinction Rebellion meetings and their famous 'heading for extinction' talk. 'It can't be that bad' I thought. I'd hoped that when I started studying, the things I would learn would show that that talk had been a huge exaggeration. Unfortunately, that was not the case'.\\nDescribing the abseiling stunt she said: 'I was terrified stepping off that bridge. I decided to put my name out and wear my signature blue jacket hoping that people I've met would recognise me and realise that climate activists are just normal people too. I also know that it creates a target on my back. Certain people will wish that I'd died on that bridge today. I know that it makes my mum worry.\\n'I'm hoping my actions inspires others to be brave and take their first steps in fighting for our future. Not everyone has to hang off a bridge and get arrested, but everyone has to take meaningful action for things to change'.\\nThe Cambridge music student:\u00a0Cressie Gethin\\nMiss Gethin, a former student of the prestigious\u00a0Hereford Cathedral School, is currently among the group holding up the Grays refinery.\u00a0She appears to be one of the five main founders of Just Stop Oil.\\nCressie, a music student from Murray Edwards at Cambridge University, has been campaigning on climate issues at her college.\\nShe told The Tab: 'I was very very surprised that Murray Edwards came out bottom of the league tables for their climate policies because I had imagined it was something they would have cared about and been active on'.\\nThe talented chorister has performed with her brother, also a singer.\\nThe LBC mic gluer:\u00a0Nathan McGovern\\n22-year-old King's College London student Nathan McGovern, who studies religion. The Coventry activist has flirted with XR and Animal Rebellion and disrupted a game at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\\nEight days ago he was speaking to Tom Swarbrick in LBC's Westminster studio when he glued his hand to the microphone at around 11.40am.\\nMr McGovern said that the station was 'not using' its 'massive platform' to inform listeners of the dangers of the climate crisis\\nSpeaking live, Mr McGovern said to Mr Swarbrick: 'You have a massive platform, a microphone that you can use to tell people about the situation we're in and you're not using it.\\n'An ordinary person like me is having to take the microphone and tell your viewers the situation we are in.'\\nThe LBC presenter said: 'For those of you listening wondering what the banging on the microphone is, Mr McGovern seems to have, you've glued yourself to the microphone? That's fantastic.'\\nAfter the incident, LBC presenter and Daily Mail columnist Andrew Pierce took over the live programme from Global's Leicester Square, before handing back to Mr Swarbrick when arrived there.\\nDuring this time, Mc McGovern was left in the studio in the dark while waiting for police to arrive.\\nHe appeared as a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion advocating a 'plant-based food system' on Nigel Farage's GB News show in October 2021.\\nAfter the disruption, the group tweeted: 'Every new oil and gas facility tightens the noose around the necks of our young people. If the media will not communicate their predicament they will have no choice but to take the microphone.'\\nJust Stop Oil's official 'de-escalator':\u00a0Pavel Ivanov\\nMr Ivanov is billed as an expert in diffusing rows that break out at the protests when JSO's members shut down roads, for example.\\nSpeaking to The Guardian he described the 'astonishing' abuse they suffer, in a tacit admission that they are struggling to win over many of their critics.\\nIn one incident linked to the blockading of oil refineries, one driver who had protesters on his roof said: 'If the police weren't here, I'd come up and f**king throw you off myself.'\\nAnother activist with a ladder was told: 'You put that up there, mate, and I'm going to ram it down your f**king throat'.\\nMr Ivanov claims n one occasion someone got him by the throat as friends were heckled: 'You look like you're just out of nappies. Go and get a f**king job'.\\nJSO's graphic designer who won't have a baby until she tries to 'fix the world':\u00a0\u00a0Gabriella Ditton\\nAnother JSO activist is graphic designer Gabriella Ditton, 27, from Norfolk, who was arrested for blocking oil trucks on Friday.\\nIn a newspaper interview, Ms Ditton \u2013 who attended Wymondham College in Norfolk, where annual boarding fees are more than \u00a312,000 \u2013 bragged: 'I've been arrested 16 times and it's honestly fine.' She has stripped naked and covered her body in oil at protests.\\nThe group said last week: 'Gabriella would love nothing more than to have a family and continue her career as a graphic designer, but feels those things aren't an option for her anymore because of the state of the world'.\\nThe 27-year-old, who works as an animator, became hooked after going to an Extinction Rebellion talk. She said: 'I was getting my life in order to have a baby and went to the Heading for Extinction talk. I realised I couldn't bring a baby into the world before trying to fix it first.\\n'I started the way everyone does, with petitions, emailing my MP, going on marches. But I realised it doesn't work. In the future, I want to be able to say with total sincerity that I did everything I could and really mean it. I'm so frightened about society falling apart \u2013 I'm so deadly terrified that I will do literally anything to prevent it from happening'.\\nOrganic farmer and XR co-founder who branded the Holocaust 'just another f**kery in human history':\u00a0Roger Hallam\\nRoger Hallam is the co-founder of Extinction Rebellion who believes paralysing traffic will eventually cause food shortages and trigger uprisings.\\nHe once stood unsuccessfully in the 2019 European Parliament election in the London constituency as an independent, winning 924 of the 2,241,681 votes cast, which was around 0.04 per cent of the vote.\\nHe became interested in climate change in his 40s when an organic farm he ran in south Wales went bankrupt because of extreme weather conditions.\\nHallam went on hunger strike in 2017 to demand King's College London stop investing in fossil fuels. His stated ambition for the group is to 'bring down all the regimes in the world and replace them', starting with Britain.\\nHe encouraged his followers to get arrested at demonstrations en-masse as a way of raising awareness of climate change.\\nIn a recent video on YouTube, he said protesters should be ready to cause disruption through personal 'sacrifice'. If necessary, they 'should be willing to die'.\\nIn 2019 he apologised for comments he made describing the Holocaust as 'just another f**kery in human history'.\\nHallam, 55, sparked outrage in Germany yesterday by comparing the murder of six million Jewish people at the hands of the Nazis to other historical massacres and claiming that the memory of the Shoah - or Holocaust - was holding Germany back.\\nThe former organic farmer was quickly condemned by Extinction Rebellion groups in Germany, as well as the German government after his comments to a newspaper in the country.", "image": [["Some protesters have dressed up as rats and 'dirty scrubbers' for the protest as they aim jabs at the nearly 340-year-old firm this morning", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/12/11/56511953-10710667-image-a-47_1649757836620.jpg"], ["The protesters unfurled banners accusing the firm of insuring 'climate breakdown' and urged it to support 'climate justice'", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/12/11/56510669-10710667-image-a-54_1649759543566.jpg"], ["These protesters superglued themselves to a set of doors on the building.

He is up at Lewes Crown Court next month after pleading not guilty.\\nBut he is probably best known for an exchange he had on Talk Radio in October.\\nHe\u00a0appeared on Mike Graham's show where he was asked how\u00a0safe carpentry was for the environment.\\nThe conversation then took a strange turn when Ford said his work was sustainable because trees could grow back.\\nHe told the host 'You can't grow concrete' but Mr Ford responded with 'Yeah you can'.\\nThere was an awkward silence before the interview was terminated.\\nLast year\u00a0MailOnline revealed two years before his activism he went on two lengthy trips abroad.\\nWhen approached about his travels he admitted he was a hypocrite but was unrepentant about his protests.\\nHe went on a 10,000 mile four month trip across the Atlantic and around Canada - then just months later on a 2,000 mile plus jaunt across much of Europe in an old diesel van.\\nThe fossil fuels burned and the resulting carbon emissions generated by Ford\u2019s two trips would have been more than double the entire annual carbon footprint a single person in many countries produces in an entire year.\\nYet no sooner had he returned from the second trip than he was lecturing others.\\nHis incredible carbon-busting holiday marathon began in the autumn of 2019 as Ford embarked on a four month jaunt across Canada which involved a round trip of 8,500 miles in flights alone.\\nHe then travelled extensively around Canada for 120 days, posting occasional updates of him having fun in Edmonton, ice swimming in a lake in Alberta, and later sledging in British Columbia.\\nThese are just the locations he posted about but they alone mean he must have travelled at least 1,500 miles within Canada too on top of his flights - taking the entire distance travelled over 10,000 miles.\\nAnd regularly while he was enjoying this trip of a lifetime, despite its negative effects on the environment, Ford - apparently oblivious to the contradiction - was also regularly posting content promoting Extinction Rebellion and its twin pressure group Insulate Britain.\\nHe took this trip despite research published just weeks before he embarked showing that just a single long-haul flight generates more carbon emissions than an average person in many poorer countries consumes in a whole year.\\nHe finally returned to the UK in January 2020 but had only been back a matter of days when he began planning his next international trip - again apparently oblivious to the personal contributions to global warming this would inevitably cause.\\nOn January 15 he was asking advice about what van to buy for his next trip. It\u2019s not clear what he went on to spend but by August he had clearly not only bought a van but driven it many thousands of miles around continental Europe.\\nIn an album he entitled \u2018From Whittlesford to Warsaw\u2019 on August 29 he posted 25 pictures showing himself and a female companion cavorting around a series of exotic locations during the previous weeks visibly enjoying themselves at each.\\nThe direct trip between the two places would involve a round trip of well over 1,500 miles driving - and it\u2019s plain that Ford took many pleasure-driven deviations. This means he would have generated at least 380kilos of carbon.\\nContacted by MailOnline, Ford accepted the hypocrisy of his globe-trotting, but claimed he'd recently seen the light and cut down on his air miles.\\nHe said: 'We're all hypocrites.

That doesn't mean to say we're shutting the door on both, but it does mean that any movement has to have a large measure of local consent.'\\nBut his Cabinet colleague Grant Shapps yesterday called onshore wind turbines an 'eyesore' and said he does not want to see a flurry of new ones.\\nThe Transport Secretary told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme: 'I don't favour a vast increase in onshore wind farms, for pretty obvious reasons \u2013 they sit on the hills there and can create something of an eyesore for communities as well as actual problems of noise.\\n'So I think for reasons of environmental protection, the way to go with this is largely, not entirely, but largely off-sea.'\\nHe suggested nuclear and offshore wind would be more prominent in the energy strategy, adding: 'I don't think you want a huge expansion of onshore wind.' But Labour's business spokesman Jonathan Reynolds told LBC radio: 'I would have no objection at all to living close to an onshore wind farm.'\\nSources said last night that ministers had not yet finalised the strategy but that would be done early this week.\\nA Government spokesman said: 'Next week we will set out an ambitious plan to supercharge our use of a diverse range of renewables, including offshore wind, solar and hydrogen, all underpinned by nuclear and continued support for our North Sea oil and gas sector. Any decisions on onshore wind will always be subject to consent from local communities.'\\nLabour was yesterday forced into a rapid U-turn after suggesting Britain should look at rationing energy supplies.\\nThe party's business spokesman Jonathan Reynolds said ministers should be making plans to ration oil and gas in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But he quickly reversed his position and admitted rationing energy would be a 'disaster'.\\nMr Reynolds initially told BBC 1's Sunday Morning programme: 'We should be making those plans and the Government should be preparing for that situation.\\n'There's a lot of complacency in this country about the relative lower exposure to Russian gas that we have. But we should bear in mind that part of the supply that comes to this country from, for instance, Norway or from the liquefied natural gas that goes into the terminals and wells, that is partly because Russian gas is fulfilling the demands of central Europe.\\n'I think what the Government should announce is a plan which is not simply shopping from one authoritarian regime to the next for fossil fuels, but that long-term plan that would make the difference.'\\nBut he swiftly carried out a U-turn, telling Times Radio an hour later that rationing energy 'would be a disaster for households and for businesses'.\\nHe then told LBC that Labour believes 'a successful plan would absolutely mean we did not have to consider' rationing energy. He said: 'We should be making plans to make sure our energy supplies are secure, consistent with net-zero and delivered at the best possible price.\\n'And what we have put forward would do that, but what the Government are yet to tell us is their plan to do that.'\\nSome European countries are considering rationing power after Russia demanded they pay for fuel with roubles or risk losing their supply. But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps ruled out such a move in Britain, telling the BBC: 'It is not the route that we want to go down.'\\nYesterday Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the rouble payment scheme for natural gas was a prototype that will be extended to other major exports.\\nEnergy bills \u2013 up 54%, \u00a3693 a year\\nAnnual energy bills soared by 54 per cent as regulator Ofgem raised the price cap for an average home to \u00a31,971 from\u00a0\u00a31,277.

I know that it makes my mum worry.\\n'I'm hoping my actions inspires others to be brave and take their first steps in fighting for our future. Not everyone has to hang off a bridge and get arrested, but everyone has to take meaningful action for things to change'.\\nThe Cambridge music student:\u00a0Cressie Gethin\\nMiss Gethin, a former student of the prestigious\u00a0Hereford Cathedral School, is currently among the group holding up the Grays refinery.\u00a0She appears to be one of the five main founders of Just Stop Oil.\\nCressie, a music student from Murray Edwards at Cambridge University, has been campaigning on climate issues at her college.\\nShe told The Tab: 'I was very very surprised that Murray Edwards came out bottom of the league tables for their climate policies because I had imagined it was something they would have cared about and been active on'.\\nThe talented chorister has performed with her brother, also a singer.\\nThe LBC mic gluer:\u00a0Nathan McGovern\\n22-year-old King's College London student Nathan McGovern, who studies religion. The Coventry activist has flirted with XR and Animal Rebellion and disrupted a game at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\\nEight days ago he was speaking to Tom Swarbrick in LBC's Westminster studio when he glued his hand to the microphone at around 11.40am.\\nMr McGovern said that the station was 'not using' its 'massive platform' to inform listeners of the dangers of the climate crisis\\nSpeaking live, Mr McGovern said to Mr Swarbrick: 'You have a massive platform, a microphone that you can use to tell people about the situation we're in and you're not using it.\\n'An ordinary person like me is having to take the microphone and tell your viewers the situation we are in.'\\nThe LBC presenter said: 'For those of you listening wondering what the banging on the microphone is, Mr McGovern seems to have, you've glued yourself to the microphone? That's fantastic.'\\nAfter the incident, LBC presenter and Daily Mail columnist Andrew Pierce took over the live programme from Global's Leicester Square, before handing back to Mr Swarbrick when arrived there.\\nDuring this time, Mc McGovern was left in the studio in the dark while waiting for police to arrive.\\nHe appeared as a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion advocating a 'plant-based food system' on Nigel Farage's GB News show in October 2021.\\nAfter the disruption, the group tweeted: 'Every new oil and gas facility tightens the noose around the necks of our young people. If the media will not communicate their predicament they will have no choice but to take the microphone.'\\nJust Stop Oil's 'de-escalator':\u00a0Pavel Ivanov\\nMr Ivanov is reported to diffuse rows that break out at the protests when JSO's members shut down roads, for example.\\nA Guardian report described the\u00a0 'astonishing' abuse they suffer, in a tacit admission that they are struggling to win over many of their critics.\\nIn one incident linked to the blockading of oil refineries, one driver who had protesters on his roof said: 'If the police weren't here, I'd come up and f**king throw you off myself.'\\nAnother activist with a ladder was told: 'You put that up there, mate, and I'm going to ram it down your f**king throat'.\\nMr Ivanov claims n one occasion someone got him by the throat as friends were heckled: 'You look like you're just out of nappies. Go and get a f**king job'.\\nJSO's graphic designer who won't have a baby until she tries to 'fix the world':\u00a0\u00a0Gabriella Ditton\\nAnother JSO activist is graphic designer Gabriella Ditton, 27, from Norfolk, who was arrested for blocking oil trucks on Friday.\\nIn a newspaper interview, Ms Ditton \u2013 who attended Wymondham College in Norfolk, where annual boarding fees are more than \u00a312,000 \u2013 bragged: 'I've been arrested 16 times and it's honestly fine.' She has stripped naked and covered her body in oil at protests.\\nThe group said last week: 'Gabriella would love nothing more than to have a family and continue her career as a graphic designer, but feels those things aren't an option for her anymore because of the state of the world'.\\nThe 27-year-old, who works as an animator, became hooked after going to an Extinction Rebellion talk. She said: 'I was getting my life in order to have a baby and went to the Heading for Extinction talk. I realised I couldn't bring a baby into the world before trying to fix it first.\\n'I started the way everyone does, with petitions, emailing my MP, going on marches. But I realised it doesn't work. In the future, I want to be able to say with total sincerity that I did everything I could and really mean it. I'm so frightened about society falling apart \u2013 I'm so deadly terrified that I will do literally anything to prevent it from happening'.\\nOrganic farmer and XR co-founder who branded the Holocaust 'just another f**kery in human history':\u00a0Roger Hallam\\nRoger Hallam is the co-founder of Extinction Rebellion who believes paralysing traffic will eventually cause food shortages and trigger uprisings.\\nHe once stood unsuccessfully in the 2019 European Parliament election in the London constituency as an independent, winning 924 of the 2,241,681 votes cast, which was around 0.04 per cent of the vote.\\nHe became interested in climate change in his 40s when an organic farm he ran in south Wales went bankrupt because of extreme weather conditions.\\nHallam went on hunger strike in 2017 to demand King's College London stop investing in fossil fuels. His stated ambition for the group is to 'bring down all the regimes in the world and replace them', starting with Britain.\\nHe encouraged his followers to get arrested at demonstrations en-masse as a way of raising awareness of climate change.\\nIn a recent video on YouTube, he said protesters should be ready to cause disruption through personal 'sacrifice'. If necessary, they 'should be willing to die'.\\nIn 2019 he apologised for comments he made describing the Holocaust as 'just another f**kery in human history'.\\nHallam, 55, sparked outrage in Germany yesterday by comparing the murder of six million Jewish people at the hands of the Nazis to other historical massacres and claiming that the memory of the Shoah - or Holocaust - was holding Germany back.\\nThe former organic farmer was quickly condemned by Extinction Rebellion groups in Germany, as well as the German government after his comments to a newspaper in the country.", "image":

From April 9 the environmental group will convene and cause havoc in major UK cities - including London. Scores of people are today sitting in the road to block oil tankers from leaving each of seven targeted sites. Two of ten protests by Just Stop Oil group at Navigator Terminals Thames and Inter Terminals UK in Grays. They are also at Buncefield Oil Depot in Hemel Hempstead and Esso Petroleum in Tyburn, Birmingham. Further protests at\u00a0Purfleet Fuels Terminal as well as Kingsbury Oil Terminal and BP Oil Depot in Tamworth. Extinction Rebellion are carrying out other three protests near Heathrow and in Southampton and Fawley.", "text": "Extinction Rebellion will launch a new wave of protests starting next Saturday - including 'mass participation' on London streets that will be 'more disruptive than ever', the eco activists revealed today.\\nThe campaign group, also known as XR, said it was planning the latest 'rebellions' from April 9 which will start at Hyde Park and then spread throughout the capital - saying that they will be 'impossible to ignore'.\\nProtests are also planned in Birmingham and Southampton and 'non-violent direct action training' will be given. XR spokesman Andrew Smith said: 'From Saturday April 9 we will meet at 10am in Hyde Park every day. We will be easy to find, we will be easy to join, we will be more disruptive than ever, and we will be impossible to ignore.\\n'We're expecting huge numbers from the 9th. In London we won't have pink boats, we won't have pink tables, we will just have people power. In the tradition of non-violent civil disobedience, we will disrupt business as usual until the Government and big business make change. We need everyone to join us.'\\nHe continued: 'We're looking at more mass participation-style events, rather than small kind of scattergun actions which rebellions have previously consisted of. We're looking at mass participation, which are easy to join. We're asking the public to step up and join us.\u00a0We know at the moment that across the country, people are feeling kind of disenfranchised with how they've been treated by the Government. The energy crisis is really starting to hit home on people, and people really want us to step up into a space where their voice is heard.\\n'We're offering them the space where they can come and participate and join with us. Every morning we'll be offering non-violent direct action training, where we will encourage people to step up and be empowered to take action with us and speak out against Government inaction.\u00a0As a response to that, the actions will feel and look very different to previous rebellions.\\n'We want to create the mass space where people can come and join us.\u00a0The actions at the oil refineries and oil infrastructure at the moment are very, very targeted. The actions happening in London will be mass participation on the streets, and there'll be an open invite for people to come and take part in those actions.'\\nIt comes as hundreds of eco activists from Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil today blocked ten major oil terminals across England in a mass protest amid demands that the Government stops new oil and gas projects.\\nThe activists said that scores of people were sitting in the road to block oil tankers from leaving each site, while others climbed on top of oil tankers - including over 30 young people at an oil terminal in Grays, Essex.\\nSeven of the ten protests were carried out by Just Stop Oil at Navigator Terminals Thames, Inter Terminals UK and Purfleet Fuels Terminal all in Grays; Buncefield Oil Depot in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire; Esso Petroleum in Tyburn, Birmingham; and Kingsbury Oil Terminal and\u00a0BP Oil Depot, both in Tamworth, Staffordshire.\\nThe further three were organised by Extinction Rebellion demonstrators at the Esso West Terminal near London Heathrow Airport, Hamble Terminals in Southampton and Hythe Terminal in Fawley, Hampshire.\\nJust Stop Oil - which has been responsible for protests at football matches in recent weeks where activists have tied themselves to goalposts - tweeted: 'Fed up with a government burning your future? Join us on the road.'\\nOn top of fuel prices at the pumps reaching record levels thanks in part to the war in Ukraine - petrol and diesel could become scarce if the group succeeds in stopping tankers leaving to refuel petrol stations across the UK.\\nAnd it comes on the day that households across Britain are seeing the biggest rise in the cost of energy in living memory as average bills on the price cap increase by 54 per cent, or almost \u00a3700, to just under \u00a32,000 a year.\\nSpecialist police teams began to lead away those taking part in the protests in Birmingham shortly before 11am.\\nAmong those taken away by officers were two people who had climbed onto the roof of a tanker, which was able to drive away from the site after the first six protesters were removed.\\nThe group wants an end to the Government's 'policy of expanding UK oil and gas production and is calling on all those outraged at the prospect of climate collapse and suffering from the cost of living crisis to stand with us'.\\nA statement added: 'Ordinary people can no longer afford oil and gas, it's time to Just Stop Oil. It's funding war and killing people in the global south, while destroying the future for young people everywhere.'\\nEssex Police said six people had been arrested. A spokesman added: 'We are currently dealing with three incidents in Thurrock, where a group of people are reportedly blocking the roads. Six people have been arrested so far. It is impacting Navigator Fuel Centre, Esso in Purfleet, and Askew Farm Lane. Drivers are asked to avoid the area.'\\nWest Midlands Police responded to the Birmingham protest, saying that they were 'working to deal with this as quickly as possible'. The force said delays were expected on Wood Lane, Bromford Lane and Tyburn Road.\\nWest Midlands Fire Service crews were also in attendance and said those travelling were asked to 'avoid the area if possible', adding that staff were 'available to support our colleagues at West Midlands Police, if needed'.\\nExxon Mobil UK, one of the country's largest privately owned underground oil pipeline distribution networks, confirmed demonstrations were underway at some of its sites, causing operations to be temporarily suspended.\\nIt said: 'Small protests are currently underway outside our Hythe, Birmingham and West London fuel terminals.' While we respect the right to peaceful protest, our priority is the safety of our people, our neighbours, the protestors and our operations. We are working with the police to ensure that safety is maintained.'\\nThe firm - whose head offices are in Leatherhead, Surrey - said it had temporarily suspended operations at the locations mentioned, but its other terminals at Purfleet in Essex and Avonmouth near Bristol were not affected.\\nExtinction Rebellion spokesman Andrew Smith said in an online briefing this morning that the plan for the oil terminal protests is to 'blockade those sites for as long as possible'. He added that the group has blocked at least one site with a boat, and supporters are also 'locked on to tripods'.\\nThe US will release some of its vast oil reserves in a bid to ease pressure on soaring prices.\\nPresident Joe Biden laid out plans to deliver a million barrels of crude a day to the market for six months from May. Oil prices tumbled 5 per cent to $108 a barrel on the news.\\nThis could ease pressure on UK motorists, who have seen petrol prices hit record highs.\\nThe White House said the release was 'unprecedented'. It comes as the West tries to wean itself off Russian oil and gas following the Ukraine invasion.\\nBut this has triggered a rally in prices.\u00a0The increases are now driving inflation higher and worsening the cost-of-living crisis for households.\\nBrent crude hit a multi-year high of $128 in early March \u2013 up from lows of $19 seen at the peak of the pandemic.\\nThe White House said: 'The US is the world's largest oil producer and is a net energy exporter. Despite that, actions of a dictator half a world away can still impact US families.'\\nDemonstrations are expected across the UK in the coming days over the cost of living crisis.\u00a0The 'People's Assembly' expects thousands of protesters will take to the streets tomorrow at various locations to highlight those suffering 'real hardships' due to the combination of rising fuel and food prices, inflation, and low pay.\\nOn March 8, Extinction Rebellion had warned it planned to block major UK oil refineries in April and said it would 'flood London' with people from April 9 amid claims 'we will create the most roadblocks we ever have'.\\nThe direct action group said it intended to 'stop the harm at the source' as part of its campaign to force the Government to stop the fossil fuel economy.\\nThere are six major oil refineries in the UK, supplying about 85 per cent of UK fuel demand, including Petroineos's Grangemouth in Scotland, the Lindsey refinery on the Humber and Exxon's Fawley in Hampshire. Only the Fawley site was being targeted by Extinction Rebellion today.\\nA Just Stop Oil spokesman said: 'The action comes amid a series of cascading crises, the war in Ukraine, the cost of living crisis and news that climate breakdown is happening much faster than expected.\\n'However, while these events should prompt an emergency response to reduce UK dependence on oil and gas, the Government is doubling down on drilling for new oil and gas.\\n'Right now ordinary people are being made to pay, while the government wastes \u00a3230million a week subsidising the oil industry and energy companies make huge profits. There must be no more increases in fuel or heating costs. Fossil fuel companies and the richest must pay.\\n'The cost of living crisis is not going to end, but we can insulate ourselves from higher fuel prices by getting off oil and gas. No new oil, reduce demand and invest in renewables.\\n'The Just Stop Oil Coalition is calling on all of those whose futures are being destroyed, who are facing poverty and who are outraged at the prospect of continuing our dependence on fossil fuels to stand up and take action. It's 2022 and the time to stand by has passed.'", "image": [["Activists from Just Stop Oil during one of their blockades at the Esso Birmingham Fuel Terminal this morning",

'It's that simple.'\\nMcKechnie added:\u00a0'It's f***ing rough up here. We've been up here over 30 hours, haven't f***ing slept, haven't felt safe, had a f***ing panic attack a while back, it's really uncomfortable.\\n'We're under f***ing asbestos, we're breathing that in. We're f***ing breathing in a lot of s*** we shouldn't. It's not safe up here but it's a lot more safe than the climate crisis.'\\nIt comes after Downing Street accused the eco-activists of using 'guerilla tactics that obstruct people going about their day-to-day business' and promised a crackdown.\\nIn the strongest statement yet on the eco-mob 'Just Stop Oil', Number 10 today pledged that it would 'not tolerate' those\u00a0obstructing people 'going about their day-to-day business'.\\nBritain is in the grips of another fuel crisis, with petrol stations forced to close due to the disruption caused at oil terminals.\\nAround 1,200 pumps south of the midlands have been forced to turn away motorists, the Campaign for Fair Fuel claimed on Sunday, in the wake of the action by Just Stop Oil.\\nThe eco protestors have been targeting oil terminals across the south of the country, including in Hertfordshire, Essex and Warwickshire by locking themselves to pipes.\\nThe action has been blamed for shortages of both petrol and diesel at stations compounding misery for drivers already facing record prices at the pump, reported at over \u00a32 a litre in some areas.\\nMass protests have resulted in more than 800 arrests across the country and have put a 'real strain' on local police services.\\nThe protests are exacerbating existing supply issues due to increased demand after Covid lockdowns and Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\\nMcGovern, who studies religion, has previously attempted to tie himself to a goalpost during a match between West Ham and Tottenham and also glued his hand to a microphone during a heated exchange on LBC last weekend. Engineering student McKechnie has also disrupted a football game - between Everton and Newcastle last month.\\nMcKechnie was one of the 'Highway Nine' Insulate Britain protesters jailed for blocking the M25 last year and served a three month prison sentence.\\nResponding to Just Stop Oil's tactics, a No 10 spokeswoman said: 'We recognise the strength of feeling and the right to protest is a cornerstone of our democracy, but we won't tolerate guerrilla tactics that obstruct people going about their day-to-day business.'\\nThe spokeswoman added: 'We fully support the police who are putting significant resource into their response to the demonstrations.'\\nIt comes as a furious motorist today revealed how they had to drive 46 miles to fill up because of the disruption to the UK's petrol supplies, while others said they did not have enough fuel to go to work today.\\nOne driver, recounting their nightmare journey yesterday, told MailOnline:\u00a0'Every petrol station we tried was shut - we drove 11 miles to Aylesbury first and then 17 miles to Bicester before giving up and driving the ten miles back home.\\n'The next day we drove to Winslow which is another eight miles away before finding fuel there. It is total pot luck'\\nThis morning, other drivers took to social media to vent their frustration at the protesters' 'selfish, naive' actions. 'No petrol stations near to me have any fuel, no fuel means I can't work,' one Twitter user wrote this morning.\\nAnother added: 'I'm working today. I have enough petrol to get there but we probably don't have enough fuel in the work vehicles to take vulnerable people to medical appointments so they'll have to be cancelled.'\\nPriti Patel has called the protesters 'selfish, fanatical and frankly dangerous' while George Eustice, the Environment Secretary, criticised their 'extreme' tactics.\\nCampaign group Fair Fuel said up to a third of petrol stations were closed yesterday, while pictures showed some remained shut today.\\nFair Fuel founder Howard Cox told MailOnline supplies remained 'patchy' - with diesel particularly affected - but overall the situation was better than on the weekend.\\nThe AA last night shortages had been 'isolated' and none of its 2,700 patrols had experienced difficulties getting fuel.\\nMeanwhile, the Petrol Retailers Association, which represents around 65% of independently owned forecourts, said:\u00a0'We are aware of protests at several fuel supply sites; however, the majority are unaffected.'\\nSupply issues tend to hit motorists in London and the South East worse than elsewhere.\\nThis is most likely due the regions' higher population densities, Gordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retailers Association, has previously said.\\nCampaign group Just Stop Oil is now on its eleventh day of disruptive protests.\\nA video posted at 3.30am this morning showed one activist at Grays oil depot filming a selfie video from inside a pipe.\\n'We're still in the pipes, still stopping oil, still stopping whatever we non-violently can to resist the collapse of our liveable future,' he said.\\n'We really hope to make it to 24 hours and beyond because that's the only way this government will listen.\\n'This corrupt government that is pushing us towards not just a climate catastrophe but a social crisis.\\n'We're in the depths of a cost of living emergency... we're in the depths of a legitimacy crisis and unless Boris Johnson gets on with the job and stops oil and legitimacy crisis will extend to the entire global system'.\\nToday, Environment Secretary George Eustice said: 'A right to protest is important but not if it's causing havoc with other people's lives. That's wrong and not acceptable.\\n'We all recognise that we need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels... this is a mainstream agenda, people really don't need to do these extreme protests to get their point heard.'\\nProtesters\u00a0have been holding up fuel supplies by targeting Grays oil depot and two other crucial sites in Warwickshire and Hertfordshire.\\nAnd yesterday some also blocked two central London bridges in a series of 'exceptionally dangerous' stunts.\\nThe mayhem comes ahead of a record 21.5million motorists preparing to take to the roads this coming Easter weekend.\\nYesterday, a frustrated Priti Patel said: 'Hard-working people across our country are seeing their lives brought to a standstill by selfish, fanatical and frankly dangerous so-called activists.\\n'Keir Starmer's Labour Party repeatedly voted against our proposals that would have given the police extra powers to deal with this eco mob. The police have my full backing in doing everything necessary to address this public nuisance.'\\nIn a sign of the havoc, nearly a third of drivers surveyed in the Midlands and the South East reported a lack of fuel at forecourts. Diesel was in especially short supply.\\nMinisters had planned to introduce new powers to help police tackle eco-protesters but the measures were blocked in the House of Lords in January.\\nAt the time, Miss Patel accused Labour of siding with 'vandals and thugs'.\\nProposed measures had included an offence of 'locking on' in a bid to stop protesters resorting to the common tactic of chaining themselves to buildings and vehicles.\\nNew stop and search powers were also proposed to allow police to detain protesters arriving carrying bike locks and other equipment designed to make themselves difficult to remove.\\nMinisters are expected to try to revive the measures in the next Queen's Speech.\\nYesterday the Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion fanatics brought chaos to fuel depots.\\nAt the Kingsbury oil terminal in Warwickshire they claimed to have dug a tunnel under a tanker route in a bid to block deliveries to forecourts.\\nUp to 40 campaigners then locked themselves to the gates of the Buncefield terminal in Hertfordshire.\\nThis was followed by further action at the Exolum storage terminal in Grays, Essex.\\nThe group has vowed to continue until ministers agree to stop all new fossil fuel investments. On Lambeth Bridge, hundreds of protesters prevented cars and buses from using the key route linking north and south London.\\nThe protest had a festival atmosphere, with speakers playing dance music and a stall handing out pasta and falafel. The activists sat down and refused to move for hours. However they allowed ambulances to pass.\\nA samba band joined the protesters blocking cars and buses on Vauxhall Bridge.\\nThe Metropolitan Police reopened both London bridges by 8pm last night, making 38 arrests. Essex Police said the depot protest tactics were becoming 'exceptionally dangerous' and putting activists and officers at 'unacceptable' risk of harm.\\nAssistant Chief Constable Glen Pavelin said: 'We cannot stand by while criminal acts are being committed, and lives are being put at risk, in the name of protest.'\\nThe force has made 338 arrests since the protests began on April 1.\\nWarwickshire Police has detained 180 people and its assistant chief constable, Ben Smith, said: 'While we will always recognise and respect the public's right to peaceful protest, we will take action against anyone who breaks the law or causes significant impact on the local community.'\\nA spokesman for the UK Petroleum Industry Association said: 'The industry is working hard to ensure fuels are being delivered as quickly as possible.'\\nBy Martin Robinson\\nThe green zealots trying to make Britain run out of fuel are a bunch of privileged students and professional protesters, MailOnline can reveal today.\\nActivists from Just Stop Oil have been hampering access to petrol and diesel for days, demanding that the Government stops new fossil fuel projects by digging tunnels below refineries, vandalising tankers or storming the terminals to climb on to the pipes.\\nEssex Police has arrested more than 350 protesters since the disruption started on April 1 - while queues have formed at petrol stations across the country and some have even shut down due to a shortage of fuel.\\nOne of the ringleaders is 'John Lennon lookalike' Louis McKechnie, a Bournemouth University graduate last seen 'surfing' on an oil truck in Essex on Friday.\u00a0He became a poster boy for JSO after he tied himself to a goalpost to disrupt a Premier League at Everton last month.\\nAround\u00a012 students remain within the pipes at Grays Inter Terminal today, including former boarding school choir girl and now Cambridge University student Cressie\u00a0Gethin. With her in the rafters is\u00a0student Nathan McGovern, another golden boy of the movement.\\nAlso manning the barricades are Brighton-based activist Hannah Hunt, 23, another student with a taste for expensive hobbies and travel, and Eben Lazarus, who describes himself as a 'musician and activist'.\\nAnd in the tunnels below the BP Kingsbury Oil Terminal in Warwickshire is retired vicar Tim Hewes, a veteran of the Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain movement who also sewed his lips together in protest against Rupert Murdoch.\\nOther members of the Just Stop Oil group, which is closely linked to the Extinction Rebellion, Animal Rebellion and Insulate Britain groups, is a rollerskating watchmaker and JSO's official 'de-escalator', XR's 'arts co-ordinator' and a Welsh organic farmer whose family business failed and he blamed climate change.\\nThese are the protesters at the heart of the current chaos that is leaving millions of Britons short on fuel:\\nThe Lennon-lookalike posterboy: Louis McKechnie\\nLouis McKechnie, 21, was charged with pitch encroachment and aggravated trespass after the incident at Goodison Park during the game between Everton and Newcastle United last month.\\nHe stormed the pitch halfway through the match and zip-tied himself to the goalpost wearing a bright orange t-shirt saying: 'Just stop oil.' Louis has said he has received 'hundreds' of death threats since running on to the pitch.\\nMcKechnie is a Bournemouth University student whose activism began with\u00a0Extinction Rebellion (XR) in 2020 before he joined vegan group Animal Rebellion.\\nThe 21-year-old, whose experience of work appears to be only stints with a local fish-and-chip shop and supermarket, was one of the 'Highway Nine' Insulate Britain protesters jailed for blocking the M25 last year.\\nAfter serving half of a three-month prison sentence, he warned: 'What comes next will make Insulate Britain look like child's play.'\\nRebel reverend: Tim Hewes\\nReverend Hewes, who once sewed up his lips in protest at the influence of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, was also repeatedly part of the mob blocking the M25 despite already being arrested numerous times.\\nThe activist has 'permission to officiate' in the Diocese of Oxford although he does not have a parish, and is today in tunnels under an oil tanker route.\\nAsked about Rev Hewes last year, a spokesman for the diocese said: 'The actions of Rev Hewes and others, while arguably well-intentioned, have frustrated many people and we're unclear how the actions have been productive in encouraging the urgent change required.'\\nRev Hewes, a retired dentist, previously said the Bishop of Dorchester, Gavin Collins, who comes under the Diocese of Oxford, had told him 'he does support issues regarding climate change and the environment but not about breaking the law'.\\nToday he is in a tunnel under a key tanker route to the BP Kingsbury Terminal in Warwickshire.\\nHe said: 'I'm here because our government is useless, they make a lot of noise but they are doing nothing.\\n'As a priest I have a duty of care for people, and also for creation. What I'm doing here, with everyone in this caravan, is what our government should be doing \u2013 that is trying to protect our families and our loved ones from the appalling future that stands before us.\\n'I hope we can continue what we're doing and stop the flow of oil, if the government won't.'\\nThe jetsetting yachtswoman: Hannah Hunt\\nThe JSO protester is from Brighton, a common home town for Green zealots.\\nMiss Hunt is a former XR supporter who broke into an ExxonMobil Oil refinery in Hampshire. She also posed with Mr\u00a0McKechnie outside Downing Street with a letter for Boris Johnson.\\nShe also glued herself to the red carpet at the Bafta awards and admits to experiencing severe anxiety before a protest. But describing her state after starting she said she enjoys 'a weird, dreamy, calm mindset' she finds empowering.\\nThe Brighton-based activist studied at Sussex University, where she joined the sailing team. Her Instagram shows her holidaying in locations including Australia, Greece, Gran Canaria and Bali.\\nShe is currently in the rafters of the Grays refinery, with\u00a0Eben Lazarus, a musician and activist also from Brighton.\u00a0Sharing a video she said they were 'cold and uncomfortable' 17 hours into their protest, but added: 'But that suffering is minute compared to those in the frontline of the climate crisis'.\\nEben then encourages people to 'step up' and join protests because 'nobody can be a bystander if we want any chance of a future'.\\nXR's 'arts-co-ordinator': Indigo Rumbelow\\nEco-fanatic Indigo Rumbelow, 27, from Gower, South-West Wales, has been arrested at least five times. In a Zoom call watched by The Mail on Sunday last week, she told activists: 'We want to create sustained disruption for two weeks.'\\nDescribing her motivations, Miss Rumbelow said: 'My generation is being forced into action because our Government is destroying our future. We will immediately end all actions when it makes a statement that it will stop all new oil and gas.'\\nIndigo was first arrested at Cannes Lions Advertising Festival in 2019 for gate-crashing a Facebook conference and has been held by police on at least six occasions since then.\\nIn 2020 she began digging up the lawn in front of the Ministry for Housing Communities and Local Government and was arrested again in Parliament Square later that year when she blocked the road.\\nJustifying her behaviour recently she said: 'The only thing to do in a system that is driving itself to extinction is to rebel. If we look at the history books, we can see that the only way of creating the nonlinear change we need is for people to commit civil disobedience and force that change.\\n'Currently too few people are taking the necessary action. I urge anyone reading this article to realise that they too can rebel. In order to prevent ecosystem and societal collapse, at this pivotal moment in history, ordinary people need to take extra-ordinary action'.\\nThe rollerskating watchmaker: Amy Rugg-Easey\\nMiss Rugg-Easey was involved in shutting down Tower Bridge last Friday.\\nShe and an unnamed man threw themselves off the bridge using abseil ropes and tiers a giant 'End fossil fuels now' banner.\\nThe Labour-voting voting watchmaker and rollerskater from Newcastle upon Tyne describes herself as a 'rebel for life'.\\nDescribing her descent into eco-activism she said: 'I quit my career in watchmaking to study environmental science after listening to science podcasts while working at my bench. I remember thinking at the time 'it can't be that bad'. Climate change was something that you heard about every now again in the news as if it was the weather. When I really started to look at the facts, I started to panic. I felt a need to do something about it.\\nWhen I began my degree, I had already been to a few Extinction Rebellion meetings and their famous 'heading for extinction' talk. 'It can't be that bad' I thought. I'd hoped that when I started studying, the things I would learn would show that that talk had been a huge exaggeration. Unfortunately, that was not the case'.\\nDescribing the abseiling stunt she said: 'I was terrified stepping off that bridge. I decided to put my name out and wear my signature blue jacket hoping that people I've met would recognise me and realise that climate activists are just normal people too. I also know that it creates a target on my back. Certain people will wish that I'd died on that bridge today. I know that it makes my mum worry.\\n'I'm hoping my actions inspires others to be brave and take their first steps in fighting for our future. Not everyone has to hang off a bridge and get arrested, but everyone has to take meaningful action for things to change'.\\nThe Cambridge music student:\u00a0Cressie Gethin\\nMiss Gethin, a former student of the prestigious\u00a0Hereford Cathedral School, is currently among the group holding up the Grays refinery.\u00a0She appears to be one of the five main founders of Just Stop Oil.\\nCressie, a music student from Murray Edwards at Cambridge University, has been campaigning on climate issues at her college.\\nShe told The Tab: 'I was very very surprised that Murray Edwards came out bottom of the league tables for their climate policies because I had imagined it was something they would have cared about and been active on'.\\nThe talented chorister has performed with her brother, also a singer.\\nThe LBC mic gluer:\u00a0Nathan McGovern\\n22-year-old King's College London student Nathan McGovern, who studies religion. The Coventry activist has flirted with XR and Animal Rebellion and disrupted a game at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\\nEight days ago he was speaking to Tom Swarbrick in LBC's Westminster studio when he glued his hand to the microphone at around 11.40am.\\nMr McGovern said that the station was 'not using' its 'massive platform' to inform listeners of the dangers of the climate crisis\\nSpeaking live, Mr McGovern said to Mr Swarbrick: 'You have a massive platform, a microphone that you can use to tell people about the situation we're in and you're not using it.\\n'An ordinary person like me is having to take the microphone and tell your viewers the situation we are in.'\\nThe LBC presenter said: 'For those of you listening wondering what the banging on the microphone is, Mr McGovern seems to have, you've glued yourself to the microphone? That's fantastic.'\\nAfter the incident, LBC presenter and Daily Mail columnist Andrew Pierce took over the live programme from Global's Leicester Square, before handing back to Mr Swarbrick when arrived there.\\nDuring this time, Mc McGovern was left in the studio in the dark while waiting for police to arrive.\\nHe appeared as a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion advocating a 'plant-based food system' on Nigel Farage's GB News show in October 2021.\\nAfter the disruption, the group tweeted: 'Every new oil and gas facility tightens the noose around the necks of our young people. If the media will not communicate their predicament they will have no choice but to take the microphone.'\\nJust Stop Oil's official 'de-escalator':\u00a0Pavel Ivanov\\nMr Ivanov is billed as an expert in diffusing rows that break out at the protests when JSO's members shut down roads, for example.\\nSpeaking to The Guardian he described the 'astonishing' abuse they suffer, in a tacit admission that they are struggling to win over many of their critics.\\nIn one incident linked to the blockading of oil refineries, one driver who had protesters on his roof said: 'If the police weren't here, I'd come up and f**king throw you off myself.'\\nAnother activist with a ladder was told: 'You put that up there, mate, and I'm going to ram it down your f**king throat'.\\nMr Ivanov claims n one occasion someone got him by the throat as friends were heckled: 'You look like you're just out of nappies. Go and get a f**king job'.\\nJSO's graphic designer who won't have a baby until she tries to 'fix the world':\u00a0\u00a0Gabriella Ditton\\nAnother JSO activist is graphic designer Gabriella Ditton, 27, from Norfolk, who was arrested for blocking oil trucks on Friday.\\nIn a newspaper interview, Ms Ditton \u2013 who attended Wymondham College in Norfolk, where annual boarding fees are more than \u00a312,000 \u2013 bragged: 'I've been arrested 16 times and it's honestly fine.' She has stripped naked and covered her body in oil at protests.\\nThe group said last week: 'Gabriella would love nothing more than to have a family and continue her career as a graphic designer, but feels those things aren't an option for her anymore because of the state of the world'.\\nThe 27-year-old, who works as an animator, became hooked after going to an Extinction Rebellion talk. She said: 'I was getting my life in order to have a baby and went to the Heading for Extinction talk. I realised I couldn't bring a baby into the world before trying to fix it first.\\n'I started the way everyone does, with petitions, emailing my MP, going on marches. But I realised it doesn't work. In the future, I want to be able to say with total sincerity that I did everything I could and really mean it. I'm so frightened about society falling apart \u2013 I'm so deadly terrified that I will do literally anything to prevent it from happening'.\\nOrganic farmer and XR co-founder who branded the Holocaust 'just another f**kery in human history':\u00a0Roger Hallam\\nRoger Hallam is the co-founder of Extinction Rebellion who believes paralysing traffic will eventually cause food shortages and trigger uprisings.\\nHe once stood unsuccessfully in the 2019 European Parliament election in the London constituency as an independent, winning 924 of the 2,241,681 votes cast, which was around 0.04 per cent of the vote.\\nHe became interested in climate change in his 40s when an organic farm he ran in south Wales went bankrupt because of extreme weather conditions.\\nHallam went on hunger strike in 2017 to demand King's College London stop investing in fossil fuels.

The theft, despoliation and rape of the land.\\n\u2018The Norman yoke which we tend to call now the Norman British yoke because of the passage of the time.\u2019\\nBefore forming Independent Mercia, Jeff was inspired by a number of works by historians including Christopher Hill\u2019s The Norman Yoke (1997) and Denis Butler\u2019s 1066: The Story Of A Year (1966).\\n\u2018Independent Mercia, in an important sense, is nothing new. It isn\u2019t a novelty. It\u2019s continuing a row that has gone on for almost a millennium,' Jeff says.\\n\u2018Independent Mercia isn\u2019t about history. It\u2019s not trying to recreate something that was lost a thousand years ago.\\n\u2018What it is doing is identifying the key principles of Anglo-Saxon England and Mercia. That is: organic democracy, ecological balance and co-operative community.\\n\u2018It\u2019s attempting to bring those wonderful, and very sensible, concepts which mean we can have a sustainable society for ever more.\u2019\\nThere are three main steps to becoming an internationally-recognised state: declare independence, gain recognition and join the United Nations.\\nTo establish a new country, it must first satisfy the international laws that all free countries generally acknowledge.\\nA new country must be recognised by existing states within the international community.\\nBeing admitted into the UN goes a long way toward a new country becoming recognised by the international community.\\nInspired by his reading, Jeff joined an organisaton called the Movement for Middle England led by a man known only as Woody.\\nBut disgruntled with the lack of members and the unclear ideology of the group, Jeff and Geff Littlejohns left and formed the Mercia Movement in August 19, 1993.\\nThe movement then spent the next four years producing a work entitled The Mercia Manifesto and another four years on a Draft Constitution for Mercia.\\nThey then promoted a Mercian Constitutional Convention in Birmingham between 2001 and 2003 and following deliberation and amendments published The Constitution for Mercia, a 21-page booklet.\\nThree members of the Convention, Jeff, Joyce Millington and David Bastable, issued the Declaration of Mercian Independence, in Victoria Square, Birmingham, on May 29, 2003.\\nThe Mercian Constitutional Convention renamed itself the Acting Witan of Mercia after the declaration.\\nA 'witan' in Anglo-Saxon times was the gathering of the king's advisers.\\nAnd so Independent Mercia was born.\\n\u2018We have 2,500 registered citizens and every single one of them regard the Constitution as the law of the land.\\nThe UK consists of three countries: England, Scotland, Wales and the province of Northern Ireland.\\nMost of Ireland seceded from the UK in 1922, leaving the present United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which formally adopted that name in 1927.\\n\u2018In so-called UK law, all of the people are subjects of the Crown. In other words, they are owned by the hereditary monarch who is illegal.\\n\u2018I\u2019m not a subject of the Crown and I have resigned from the UK even though I have to cope with certain aspects of it.\\n\u2018The United Kingdom is in illegal occupation of not just Mercia, but all of England and Wales. We want our land back,\u2019 Jeff says.\\nOriginally from the town of Hanley, Staffordshire, Jeff does pay his taxes although he argues \u2018not by compulsion as I don\u2019t have to pay anything\u2019.\\n\u2018If I decide to, I will cease paying tax whatever the consequences. With regards to voting, I have left the UK and don\u2019t vote or recognise the system.\u2019\\nIndependent Mercia is allied with another group named Independent Northumbria and is working on forming an English Confederation.\\nThe four main kingdoms in Anglo-Saxon England were East Anglia, Mercia, Northumbria and Wessex.\\nThe current shires of Mercia include Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Hertfordshire, Huntingdonshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Middlesex, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Rutland, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire.\\nSeveral countries have successfully become independent from the United Kingdom including Barbados, India, the United States and Jamaica.\\nIn 1973, there was referendum asking\u00a0voters in Northern Ireland\u00a0if they wanted to remain in the United Kingdom or to leave and join with the Republic of Ireland. They voted\u00a098.9 per cent to 1.1 per cent in favour.\\nIn the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, 55.3 per cent of voters\u00a0chose 'No' to the question: 'Should Scotland be an independent country?' and 44.7 per cent of voters chose 'Yes'.\\nThe Acting Witan of Mercia is also concerned by climate change and ecological balance is one of its founding principles.\\nIt fundamentally opposes HS2 running through its territory and supports Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain.\\nThis is not surprising given that some of its founding members were originally involved with the Green Party.\\n\u2018There is no sustainable future on the current UK model. The land cannot support the vast population of the country.\\n\u2018Had the Battle of Hastings been won, one might argue that England would be like the more progressive Scandinavian countries today.\\n\u2018We want ecological balance to be the bedrock of Independent Mercia. The essence of it is food. People can\u2019t eat computers.\\n\u2018If humans don\u2019t get back in synchronization with the planet, then we will be part of the sixth great extinction,\u2019 Jeff explains.\\nOn February 26, 2010, Jeff and the Acting Sheriff of Staffordshire, Philip Snow, made a declaration outside the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery in Stoke-on-Trent claiming the Staffordshire Hoard to be the property of the citizens of Mercia.\\nThe 'war hoard' collection was discovered by metal detectorist Terry Herbert who was using a \u00a32 metal detector he bought from a car boot sale to explore a field near Lichfield belonging to farmer Fred Johnson.\\nTheir find on July 5, 2009, was sold off to museums for \u00a33.285million and the funds were split between them.\\nThe haul of 3,900 items is thought to belong to Mercian King Penda, a Pagan leader who ruled until 655AD.\\nJeff wrote to the Queen twice to claim that the gold belongs to Mercia and that the British Crown had stolen it.\\nSince then, Jeff has claimed he would be prepared to die for the Acting Witan of Mercia.\\n\u2018As the convenor, I am the focal point to the outside world. My name is out there.\\n\u2018If we had enough followers, it would be well within the UK\u2019s power to send the SAS, capture me, take me away and stick me in the Tower of London.\u2019\\nBut can Independent Mercia free the Midlands from the oppression of Westminster?\\nWith Brexit and Scottish independence looking more and more likely, Jeff believes the time for Mercia is now.\\nLong-running tensions between Madrid and Catalonia boiled over in 2017 when the region in north-east Spain held a referendum on independence.\\nCatalonia, one of Spain's 17 autonomous regions, has a population of around 7.5 million people and includes the tourist-popular city of Barcelona.\\nThe region has its own language as well as Spanish and generates a fifth of Spain's 1.1trillion-euro ($1.3trillion) economy, but polls show its voters are divided on the question of independence.\\nThe European Union has said an independent Catalonia would not be allowed to stay in the bloc.\\nThe referendum on October 1, 2017, was organised by Catalan authorities but declared invalid by the central Spanish government, led by Mariano Rajoy.\\nThe pro-independence side won with more than 90 per cent of the vote but turnout was below half and the ballot was considered illegal by the Spanish government.\\nSpanish national police and Civil Guard officers clashed with voters as they tried to break up balloting.\\nMore than 890 civilians and 430 police were injured when anti-riot squads moved into polling stations and dispersed voters.\\nSpain's anti-riot squads fired rubber bullets, smashed into polling stations and beat protesters with batons.\\nBut Spanish authorities commended the police, saying their response to the voting was professional and proportionate.\\nOn October 27, 2017, separatist lawmakers declared independence in a session boycotted by opposition parties.\\nThe declaration was not recognised by any UN country and then-Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont fled to Brussels three days later.\\nRejecting Catalonia's move, Madrid sacked the Catalan government and imposed direct rule, dissolved its parliament and issued an arrest warrant for Puigdemont. The latter was later dropped.\\nSpain's King Felipe VI also spoke out, urging Catalan lawmakers to respect their region's diversity and avoid confrontation over independence.\\nNew Catalan elections in December 2017 saw separatist parties triumph but the pro-independence movement remains divided.\\nMany Catalan separatist leaders and activists who supported the referendum are either awaiting trial in prison or fled the country.\\nDirect rule over Catalonia was removed in May 2018 when pro-separatist Quim Torra was chosen as the region's new leader, replacing Puigdemont.\\nA month later Rajoy was ousted as Spain's prime minister and replaced by Pedro Sanchez who had shown more willingness to engage with the Catalan movement.", "image": [["Philip Snow (left), facilitator at the time, and Jeff Kent (right) at Independent Mercia's Staffordshire Hoard event on February 26, 2010", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/11/23/12/50864139-10233961-image-a-2_1637670493443.jpg"], ["An impassioned 2,500-strong group of 'citizens' have formed a movement for the independence of Mercia, a region that roughly relates to the modern Midlands", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/16/09/51302803-10233961-An_impassioned_2_500_strong_group_of_citizens_have_formed_a_move-a-22_1650098041733.jpg"], ["Independent Mercia's official image featuring the Anglo-Saxon white dragon designed by member Colin Bex", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/11/23/12/50864435-10233961-image-a-4_1637671050922.jpg"], ["A scene from the Bayeux Tapestry, depicting the death of the leader of the English Confederation (of which Mercia was a member) at the Battle of Hastings.

He\u00a0was expelled from the Tory party following the verdict.\\nHowever,\u00a0Conservative MP Blunt, who came out as gay in 2010, slammed the verdict in a stunning statement posted on his website.\\nHe said the sexual assault conviction would have 'dreadful wider implications for millions of LGBT+ Muslims around the world' and claimed the prosecution's argument relied on 'lazy tropes about LGBT+ people'. He also called for the convicted sex offender to be reinstated to public service.\\nBlunt's comments triggered fury with Labour condemning his defence of Khan and Anneliese Dodds, Labour Party chairwoman and shadow equalities secretary, labelling them 'disgraceful'.\\nShe called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Tory chairman Oliver Dowden to 'take action' against the former prisons minister and 'distance their party from his comments'.\\nMeanwhile, four\u00a0members of a cross-party LGBT+ group that Blunt chairs quit in protest, with one urging him to resign from his role.\\nLabour's Chris Bryant and Kate Osborne and the SNP's Stewart McDonald and Joanna Cherry all stood down from the group over Blunt's comments.\\nIn his statement, Blunt, the MP for Reigate said: 'I am utterly appalled and distraught at the dreadful miscarriage of justice that has befallen my friend and colleague Imran Ahmad Khan, MP for Wakefield since December 2019.\\n'His conviction today is nothing short of an international scandal, with dreadful wider implications for millions of LGBT+ muslims around the world.\\n'I sat through some of the trial. The conduct of this case relied on lazy tropes about LGBT+ people that we might have thought we had put behind us decades ago.\\n'As a former Justice Minister I was prepared to testify about the truly extraordinary sequence of events that has resulted in Imran being put through this nightmare start to his Parliamentary career.\\n'I hope for the return of Imran Ahmad Khan to the public service that has exemplified his life to date.\\n'Any other outcome will be a stain on our reputation for justice, and an appalling own goal by Britain as we try to take a lead in reversing the Victorian era prejudice that still disfigures too much of the global statute book.'\\nA court heard 48-year-old Khan had been invited to celebrate the\u00a021st birthday of a 15-year-old Catholic schoolboy's sister at her home as a 'friend of a friend' before he dragged the child upstairs, pushed him onto a bed and asked him to watch porn before sexually assaulting him.\\nKhan appeared wearing a dark suit holding a walking stick and showed no emotion when hearing his guilty verdict this afternoon. He had previously denied sexual assault and accused his traumatised victim of lying\u00a0\u2013 but jurors heard how he had also drugged and assaulted an aid worker in Pakistan nearly three years after attacking the boy.\\nIt has also emerged that Khan tweeted in support of press freedom on the day he tried to gag the media from reporting his name over a charge of sexually assaulting a schoolboy.\\nHe attempted to stop key details of the case - including the age of his victim, his own homosexuality, and even his fondness for a gin and tonic - coming into the public domain.\\nThe disgraced Wakefield MP was thwarted in his bid for secrecy unprecedented in a case not involving national security following two expensive legal challenges from media organisations.\\nThe full details of how the story finally came to be told can be reported for the first time after he was found guilty of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy after a party in 2008.\\nThe victim came forward days after Khan was elected in 2019 and gave three video-recorded interviews to police - two in December 2019 and one in February last year, when he drove almost 200 miles from his home during the pandemic's second wave.\\nKhan was sent a questionnaire by Staffordshire Police rather than being interviewed under caution at a station because of 'Covid protocols in place at the time', providing written answers on May 7, 2020.\\nNeither Staffordshire Police nor the Crown Prosecution Service informed the media or the public when Khan was charged by postal requisition - the point at which suspects in criminal cases are routinely named.\\nHis first appearance at Westminster Magistrates' Court by videolink on June 3 last year did not appear on the public or press lists.\\nChief Magistrate Paul Goldspring granted the MP an interim anonymity order ahead of another unlisted hearing, which the CPS refused to confirm was taking place as well as what charge Khan was facing.\\nOn June 17 last year, the day Khan argued in court he should be granted anonymity, he retweeted then foreign secretary Dominic Raab's message about 'press freedom' in Hong Kong.\\nKhan had previously spoken in the Commons against Extinction Rebellion's efforts to 'constrain press freedom' after the protest group blocked a newspaper printing press.\\nHis lawyers said that as a serving MP there were concerns about his safety and argued he should not be named in court because it would breach his right to life (Article 2), protection from 'inhuman or degrading treatment' (Article 3) and right to a private life (Article 8) under the European Convention of Human Rights.\\nThe application included statements from former British diplomat and intelligence officer Richard Barrett and former senior RAF officer Afzal Ashraf, a letter from DUP MP Jim Shannon on House of Commons paper and openly available information about Ahmadi Muslims.\\nBut a risk assessment by West Yorkshire police counter-terrorism security advisers concluded that there was 'no objective threat to defendant's life that would arise from being named as the defendant in these allegations'.\\nRejecting Khan's application, Mr Goldspring noted the MP's earlier attempts to prevent the press reporting the victim was a minor gave 'insight into the defendant's real concerns'.\\n'Damage to reputation is not a ground for making of an order, open justice is and should remain a corner stone of democracy and the rule of law,' he said.\\nKhan was given until 4pm the following day to challenge the decision in the High Court before the order automatically expired.\\nHowever, Khan's lawyers instead sought a review of the decision by the Old Bailey's most senior judge Mark Lucraft QC at a hastily arranged hearing, where his name was listed as 'IK'.\\nThe judge told Khan he did not have jurisdiction to change the decision and would have agreed with the Chief Magistrate even if he did, meaning the charge against Khan could be reported for the first time.\\nThe publicity prompted a second complainant - who said Khan performed a sex act on him in Pakistan in 2010 - to come forward.\\nProsecutor Sean Larkin QC said during legal argument it was a 'mere technicality' the MP was not charged with a further offence because it was outside the jurisdiction before a change in UK law.\\nOn the first day of his trial, Khan's name appeared only as asterisks on the public Southwark Crown Court list and he launched another bid for reporting restrictions, of which journalists had no prior warning.\\nHis lawyer Gudrun Young QC said the court had been informed weeks earlier, but both the judge and prosecutor said they had only been notified the day before the trial.\\nKhan argued that as an Ahmadi Muslim, both the consumption of alcohol and homosexuality are strictly prohibited within his faith, and the reporting of those matters would expose him to 'a risk to his safety both here and abroad'.\\nThe 'evidence' ran to more than 200 pages, including claims a bullet was found in his constituency office in January 2020, dozens of tweets, including one of a noose, and reference to the murders of MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.\\nHigh Court judge Mr Justice Baker made a temporary order, meaning the prosecution opening could not be fully reported, to allow the media time to make representations.\\nKey parts of the complainant's evidence could not be reported live, but the order was lifted at the end of the second day of the trial - at which Khan was allowed to sit outside the dock because the court's microphones did not work - after news organisations instructed counsel at an estimated cost of \u00a34,000.\\nHe was today suspended from the Conservative Party 'with immediate effect' following the conviction.\\nIt can now also be revealed that the disgraced MP tweeted in support of press freedom on the day he tried to gag the media from reporting his name over the charge of sexual assault.\\nThe Catholic teenager, now in his late 20s, told a jury he was left feeling 'scared, vulnerable, numb, shocked and surprised' after the future politician touched his feet and legs, coming within 'a hair's breadth' of his privates, as he tried to sleep in a top bunkbed.\\nHe said he wasn't 'taken very seriously' when he made the allegation to the Conservative Party press office days before Khan was elected as the MP for Wakefield in West Yorkshire in the December 2019 general election, Southwark Crown Court was told.\\nThe victim made a complaint to police days after Khan helped Prime Minister Boris Johnson win a large Commons majority by taking Wakefield in the so-called 'red wall' that had formed Labour's heartlands in the Midlands and northern England.\\nNo further action had been taken because the youngster did not want to make a formal complaint. However, the victim told jurors 'it all came flooding back' when he learned Khan was standing in the 2019 election.\\nKhan, who is gay and a Muslim,\u00a0had also made a lewd comment about the boy's older brother who was wearing a kilt. A court heard he asked if he was wearing the kilt like a 'true Scotsman' lifted it up to see if he was wearing underwear.\\nThe judge, Mr Justice Baker, said he will sentence Khan on a later date.\\nKhan will be thrown out of the House of Commons if he is handed a prison sentence of more than a year, or otherwise could be subject to a petition to oust him in the recall process.\\nSir Keir Starmer's Labour Party called for Khan's immediate resignation as an MP following the verdict.\\nA party spokesman said: 'Imran Ahmad Khan should immediately resign so a by-election can take place and the people of Wakefield can get the representation they deserve.'\\nThe judge released Khan on bail, telling him: 'You have been convicted by a jury of this offence of sexual assault and you will have to be sentenced in due course.\\n'I make it clear that all sentencing options, including immediate custody, are being considered by the court.'\\nAnneliese Dodds, Labour Party chairwoman and shadow equalities secretary, labelled Mr Blunt's comments about Khan's conviction as 'disgraceful'.\\nShe called on the Prime Minister and Tory chairman Oliver Dowden to 'take action' against the Reigate MP and 'distance their party from his comments'.\\nA Tory spokesman, when asked whether the party agreed with Mr Blunt's view, reiterated that Khan had been expelled from Boris Johnson's party.\\n'Our view is pretty clear,' he added.\\nTory MPs Crispin Blunt and Sir Peter Bottomley, the father of the House of Commons, attended court today, while a third, Adam Holloway, earlier provided a character statement used as part of Khan's defence case.\\nKhan was born in Wakefield, where he attended the independent Silcoates School. He went to university at the Pushkin Institute in Russia and graduated from King's College in London with a bachelor's degree in war studies.\\nThe 48-year-old worked for the UN as a special assistant for political affairs in Mogadishu before entering Parliament.\\nKhan's 15-year-old victim told a court that he 'vividly' remembered the gin bottle Khan took to the party, the smell of the spirit in the glass tumbler, and the fizz of the bubbles as he was forced by Khan to drink the cocktail.\\nHe said Khan also watched him do pull-ups, asked him to watch pornography and told him he was 'good looking' in a 'love whisper' in his ear, which was 'disgusting and really slimy'.\\nThe victim said he pretended to be asleep in the top bunkbed before Khan reached through the wooden bars to touch his feet.\\n'He was drunk because I could hear his heavy breathing,' he said.\\nThe complainant said the 'slow caressing' continued as Khan 'worked his way around the bed' and 'up my leg', despite him telling the MP to stop.\\nHe said he 'froze', adding: 'I freaked out and jumped out of the bed and ran as fast as I could.'\\nThe boy's brother, who was 18 at the time, told jurors he was also the victim of an 'assault' when Khan asked if he was wearing his kilt like a 'true Scotsman' - referring to the tradition of wearing the garment without underwear - before lifting it up with both hands.\\nDuring legal argument, prosecutor Sean Larkin QC said it was a 'mere technicality' that Khan had not been charged with a second sexual assault of a man at a guesthouse in Pakistan, where the MP was working on a Foreign Office-funded project.\\nThe alleged victim, then in his mid-20s, said Khan performed a sex act on him in his sleep after offering him a sleeping pill as they shared a room following an evening of drinking whiskey and smoking marijuana.\\nThe man told jurors he reported the November 2010 incident to the British High Commission and the Foreign Office but did not want to go to police in Pakistan because of Khan's 'powerful connections' in the military and government.\\nHe came forward as a witness after hearing Khan had been charged with sexual assault following the MP's failed bid to gag the press from reporting his name.\\nIt is understood a charge could not be brought because the alleged assault took place outside the jurisdiction before a change in the UK law.\\nKhan claimed the sexual activity was consensual.\\nIt has also emerged that Khan tweeted in support of press freedom on the day he tried to gag the media from reporting his name over a charge of sexually assaulting a schoolboy.\\nHe attempted to stop key details of the case \u2013 including the age of his victim, his own homosexuality, and even his fondness for a gin and tonic \u2013 coming into the public domain.\\nThe disgraced Wakefield MP was thwarted in his bid for secrecy unprecedented in a case not involving national security following two expensive legal challenges from media organisations.\\nThe full details of how the story finally came to be told can be reported for the first time after he was found guilty of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy after a party in 2008.\\nThe victim came forward days after Khan was elected in 2019 and gave three video-recorded interviews to police \u2013 two in December 2019 and one in February last year, when he drove almost 200 miles from his home during the pandemic's second wave.\\nKhan was sent a questionnaire by Staffordshire Police rather than being interviewed under caution at a station because of 'Covid protocols in place at the time', providing written answers on May 7, 2020.\\nNeither Staffordshire Police nor the Crown Prosecution Service informed the media or the public when Khan was charged by postal requisition \u2013 the point at which suspects in criminal cases are routinely named.\\nHis first appearance at Westminster Magistrates' Court by videolink on June 3 last year did not appear on the public or press lists.\\nChief Magistrate Paul Goldspring granted the MP an interim anonymity order ahead of another unlisted hearing, which the CPS refused to confirm was taking place as well as what charge Khan was facing.\\nOn June 17 last year, the day Khan argued in court he should be granted anonymity, he retweeted then foreign secretary Dominic Raab's message about 'press freedom' in Hong Kong.\\nKhan had previously spoken in the Commons against Extinction Rebellion's efforts to 'constrain press freedom' after the protest group blocked a newspaper printing press.\\nHis lawyers said that as a serving MP there were concerns about his safety and argued he should not be named in court because it would breach his right to life (Article 2), protection from 'inhuman or degrading treatment' (Article 3) and right to a private life (Article 8) under the European Convention of Human Rights.\\nA court was told that the Conservative Party press office did not take 'very seriously' allegations that a 15-year-old boy was sexually assaulted by Khan before he stood as an election candidate.\\nThe then-teenager did not want to make a formal complaint at the time but told Southwark Crown Court 'it all came flooding back' when he discovered Khan was standing to become the MP for Wakefield in West Yorkshire in the December 2019 general election.\\nGiving evidence at Southwark Crown Court, the victim's parents both broke down in tears as they told how their son was left 'inconsolable' and 'shaking' after the incident at a house in Staffordshire.\\nHe went to police days after Khan helped Prime Minister Boris Johnson win a large Commons majority by taking the constituency in the so-called 'red wall' that had formed Labour's heartlands in the Midlands and northern England.\\nBut the alleged victim, who voted Labour, told a jury that his complaint was 'not motivated by political reasons'.\\n'If it was, I would've done it before the general election,' he said. 'I also contacted the Tory press office, trying to inform them what had happened. I wasn't taken very seriously.'\\nHe continued: 'I explained that Imran Khan was running for MP and had just sort of been hurriedly put through.

So we're here to demand that we stop doing that, it's very simple.'\\nThe organisation has been blocking oil terminals and tankers across England including in Birmingham, Essex and Hampshire since April 1 and said nearly 1,000 arrests have now been made over the past month.\u00a0It said disruption would continue 'until the Government makes a statement that it will end new oil and gas projects in the UK'.\\nJust Stop Oil protester Amy Pritchard, 37, a care worker from London, said prior to the demonstration at\u00a0Kingsbury today: 'If my imprisonment helps wake people up to the seriousness of the situation, it's worth it.\\n'The UN Secretary-General clearly states 'fossil fuels are a dead end' and 'delay means death'. No new oil and gas is not a controversial demand. I want to have children and I want them to have a future.'\\nShe was quoting a statement by United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres in February in which he said 'fossil fuels are a dead end \u2013 for our planet, for humanity, and yes, for economies'.\\nSarah Webb, 51, a special educational needs tutor from Oxfordshire, was also involved in the demonstration today.\\nSpeaking prior to the action, she said:\u00a0'I'm injunction breaking at Kingsbury and risking two years in prison, to stand peacefully on a grass verge, not blocking anything.\\n'Our Government and judicial system have now effectively outlawed peaceful protest.

'It can't be that bad' I thought. I'd hoped that when I started studying, the things I would learn would show that that talk had been a huge exaggeration. Unfortunately, that was not the case'.\\nDescribing the abseiling stunt she said: 'I was terrified stepping off that bridge. I decided to put my name out and wear my signature blue jacket hoping that people I've met would recognise me and realise that climate activists are just normal people too. I also know that it creates a target on my back. Certain people will wish that I'd died on that bridge today. I know that it makes my mum worry.\\n'I'm hoping my actions inspires others to be brave and take their first steps in fighting for our future.

If the media will not communicate their predicament they will have no choice but to take the microphone.'\\nJust Stop Oil's official 'de-escalator':\u00a0Pavel Ivanov\\nMr Ivanov is billed as an expert in diffusing rows that break out at the protests when JSO's members shut down roads, for example.\\nSpeaking to The Guardian he described the 'astonishing' abuse they suffer, in a tacit admission that they are struggling to win over many of their critics.\\nIn one incident linked to the blockading of oil refineries, one driver who had protesters on his roof said: 'If the police weren't here, I'd come up and f**king throw you off myself.'\\nAnother activist with a ladder was told: 'You put that up there, mate, and I'm going to ram it down your f**king throat'.\\nMr Ivanov claims n one occasion someone got him by the throat as friends were heckled: 'You look like you're just out of nappies. Go and get a f**king job'.\\nJSO's graphic designer who won't have a baby until she tries to 'fix the world':\u00a0\u00a0Gabriella Ditton\\nAnother JSO activist is graphic designer Gabriella Ditton, 27, from Norfolk, who was arrested for blocking oil trucks on Friday.\\nIn a newspaper interview, Ms Ditton \u2013 who attended Wymondham College in Norfolk, where annual boarding fees are more than \u00a312,000 \u2013 bragged: 'I've been arrested 16 times and it's honestly fine.' She has stripped naked and covered her body in oil at protests.\\nThe group said last week: 'Gabriella would love nothing more than to have a family and continue her career as a graphic designer, but feels those things aren't an option for her anymore because of the state of the world'.\\nThe 27-year-old, who works as an animator, became hooked after going to an Extinction Rebellion talk. She said: 'I was getting my life in order to have a baby and went to the Heading for Extinction talk. I realised I couldn't bring a baby into the world before trying to fix it first.\\n'I started the way everyone does, with petitions, emailing my MP, going on marches. But I realised it doesn't work. In the future, I want to be able to say with total sincerity that I did everything I could and really mean it. I'm so frightened about society falling apart \u2013 I'm so deadly terrified that I will do literally anything to prevent it from happening'.\\nOrganic farmer and XR co-founder who branded the Holocaust 'just another f**kery in human history':\u00a0Roger Hallam\\nRoger Hallam is the co-founder of Extinction Rebellion who believes paralysing traffic will eventually cause food shortages and trigger uprisings.\\nHe once stood unsuccessfully in the 2019 European Parliament election in the London constituency as an independent, winning 924 of the 2,241,681 votes cast, which was around 0.04 per cent of the vote.\\nHe became interested in climate change in his 40s when an organic farm he ran in south Wales went bankrupt because of extreme weather conditions.\\nHallam went on hunger strike in 2017 to demand King's College London stop investing in fossil fuels. His stated ambition for the group is to 'bring down all the regimes in the world and replace them', starting with Britain.\\nHe encouraged his followers to get arrested at demonstrations en-masse as a way of raising awareness of climate change.\\nIn a recent video on YouTube, he said protesters should be ready to cause disruption through personal 'sacrifice'. If necessary, they 'should be willing to die'.\\nIn 2019 he apologised for comments he made describing the Holocaust as 'just another f**kery in human history'.\\nHallam, 55, sparked outrage in Germany yesterday by comparing the murder of six million Jewish people at the hands of the Nazis to other historical massacres and claiming that the memory of the Shoah - or Holocaust - was holding Germany back.\\nThe former organic farmer was quickly condemned by Extinction Rebellion groups in Germany, as well as the German government after his comments to a newspaper in the country", "image": [["Eco activist\u00a0Barbi Lund bragged that she has spent 10 days locked to the gates at Purfleet's oil depot in Essex with people from Just Stop Oil", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/12/17/56529217-10712213-image-m-47_1649781691024.jpg"], ["One of the 'Just Stop Oil' protests organised by Barbi Lund for\u00a0Extinction Rebellion, with the demonstrators dressed like giant blackbirds", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/12/17/56529219-10712213-image-a-46_1649781569331.jpg"], ["Nathan McGovern, 22, and Louis McKechnie, 21, disrupted operations at Grays oil depot, in Essex, for approximately 40 hours after chaining themselves to pipes high up at the site on Sunday afternoon.

I'm not happy about it. It is a chemical tanker.\\n'My driver called me and said they jumped on top of the tanker and broke off the number plates. And they cut my air line - it is disgusting.'\\nHe said he would be taking legal action, adding: 'They were vandalising the vehicle. It is criminal damage. Do they think that is right?'\\nFollowing weeks of disruption, several oil firms have now secured civil injunctions aimed at stopping environmental protesters from targeting their fuel processing sites - meaning they can be swiftly arrested for causing damage or chaining themselves to vehicles or objects on said sites and their access roads.\\nJust Stop Oil said: 'Hauliers are right, it is disgusting that we have to take this level of disruptive action to get media coverage, to get political engagement.\\n'The Government can end this misery immediately by making a statement to end new oil and gas \u2013 it's a no-brainer, logical first step.'\\nIt came after Extinction Rebellion blocked four of London's busiest bridges on the first day of the Easter bank holiday after comrades Just Stop Oil earlier raided three depots.\\nHundreds of Extinction Rebellion activists were on Waterloo, Blackfriars, Lambeth and Westminster bridges, calling for an end to new fossil fuel investments.\\nDemonstrators playing bongos and waving banners reading 'end fossil fuels now' and 'love in action' were pictured facing queues of traffic headed by double-decker buses.\\nThe Metropolitan Police said they were attempting to control the disruption.\\nHowever, photos showed three officers sitting on the back of a police van while watching the eco-warriors.\\nThe force said: 'We are aware of a number of demonstrations happening today.

These are just the locations he posted about but they alone mean he must have travelled at least 1,500 miles within Canada too on top of his flights - taking the entire distance travelled over 10,000 miles.\\nAnd regularly while he was enjoying this trip of a lifetime, despite its negative effects on the environment, Ford - apparently oblivious to the contradiction - was also regularly posting content promoting Extinction Rebellion and its twin pressure group Insulate Britain.\\nHe took this trip despite research published just weeks before he embarked showing that just a single long-haul flight generates more carbon emissions than an average person in many poorer countries consumes in a whole year.\\nHe finally returned to the UK in January 2020 but had only been back a matter of days when he began planning his next international trip - again apparently oblivious to the personal contributions to global warming this would inevitably cause.\\nOn January 15 he was asking advice about what van to buy for his next trip. It's not clear what he went on to spend but by August he had clearly not only bought a van but driven it many thousands of miles around continental Europe.\\nIn an album he entitled 'From Whittlesford to Warsaw' on August 29 he posted 25 pictures showing himself and a female companion cavorting around a series of exotic locations during the previous weeks visibly enjoying themselves at each.\\nThe direct trip between the two places would involve a round trip of well over 1,500 miles driving - and it's plain that Ford took many pleasure-driven deviations. This means he would have generated at least 380kilos of carbon.\\nPerhaps he used a modern low-emission vehicle? No - quite the contrary. The same 'lovely little van' he used for the trip, a diesel-powered Citroen, he then offered for sale in January this year by which - no doubt boosted by Ford's penchant for globe-trotting - it had an astonishing 145,000 miles on the clock.\\nOnce back in England Ford then saw no contradiction in stopping other motorists - most of whom would have been driving much shorter distances with more compelling reasons than he just had - being able to move around.", "image": [["Rhydian David Baker, owner of RD Baker, says the group surrounded his tanker near the Grays Inter Terminal in Essex, before climbing on top of it and breaking off its number plates.

It\u2019s not clear what he went on to spend but by August he had clearly not only bought a van but driven it many thousands of miles around continental Europe.\\nIn an album he entitled \u2018From Whittlesford to Warsaw\u2019 on August 29 he posted 25 pictures showing himself and a female companion cavorting around a series of exotic locations during the previous weeks visibly enjoying themselves at each.\\nThe direct trip between the two places would involve a round trip of well over 1,500 miles driving - and it\u2019s plain that Ford took many pleasure-driven deviations. This means he would have generated at least 380kilos of carbon.\\nPerhaps he used a modern low-emission vehicle? No - quite the contrary. The same \u201clovely little van\u201d he used for the trip, a diesel-powered Citroen, he then offered for sale in January this year by which - no doubt boosted by Ford\u2019s penchant for globe-trotting - it had an astonishing 145,000 miles on the clock.\\nOnce back in England Ford then saw no contradiction in stopping other motorists - most of whom would have been driving much shorter distances with more compelling reasons than he just had - being able to move around.", "image": [["A police officer tries to unglue the hand of a demonstrator on top of a fuel tank truck, during a protest of Just Stop Oil", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/14/13/56610317-10718071-image-a-82_1649939418085.jpg"], ["Police officers remove a demonstrator during a protest of Just Stop Oil, at thr roundabout in west London", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/14/13/56610281-10718071-image-a-83_1649939423630.jpg"], ["The crane had to be used in the incident", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/14/12/56608935-10718071-image-m-29_1649936750752.jpg"], ["Back to earth for the protesters", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/14/12/56608937-10718071-image-a-30_1649936756172.jpg"], ["The Just Stop Oil protest at Chiswick roundabout hot rush hour and is causing traffic chaos", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/14/09/56602701-10718071-image-a-59_1649925452196.jpg"], ["The protest was captured on traffic cameras on the Chiswick roundabout just after 8.30am", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/14/09/56602097-10718071-image-m-49_1649924477087.jpg"], ["Activists from Extinction Rebellion at Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/14/09/56564329-10718071-Activists_from_Extinction_Rebellion_outside_the_Department_for_B-a-58_1649924880484.jpg"], ["Pictures show three people holding a sign saying: 'Insiders wanted', at the reception of Shell HQ building in London today", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/14/10/56568505-10718071-Pictures_show_three_people_holding_a_sign_saying_Insiders_wanted-a-67_1649927444370.jpg"], ["Cameron Ford, 31, is a regular on the Insulate Britain protests that have blocked the M25, causing fury and mayhem for drivers", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/14/12/48873653-10718071-Cameron_Ford_31_is_a_regular_on_the_Insulate_Britain_protests_th-a-2_1649936422463.jpg"], ["Mr Ford, from Cambridgeshire has repeatedly blocked busy roads causing misery", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/14/12/48875451-10718071-Mr_Ford_from_Cambridgeshire_has_repeatedly_blocked_busy_roads_ca-a-7_1649936422516.jpg"], ["Mr Ford was pictured on his 31st birthday being dragged away from the M25", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/14/12/47955387-10718071-Mr_Ford_was_pictured_on_his_31st_birthday_being_dragged_away_fro-a-8_1649936422530.jpg"], ["Ford has embarked on two big trips in two years with one driving his old diesel Citroen van from Cambridgeshire to Poland", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/14/12/48873693-10718071-Ford_has_embarked_on_two_big_trips_in_two_years_with_one_driving-a-13_1649936422534.jpg"], ["The Buddhist and his female friend drove hundreds of miles in the old van despite its carbon emissions pumped into the air", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/14/13/48875635-10718071-The_Buddhist_and_his_female_friend_drove_hundreds_of_miles_in_th-a-73_1649939344493.jpg"], ["The globetrotting eco-warrior enjoyed an ice bathing experience on his Canada tour in which he flew across the Atlantic", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/14/13/48873655-10718071-The_globetrotting_eco_warrior_enjoyed_an_ice_bathing_experience_-a-75_1649939344502.jpg"], ["Friend of the earth?

The Ecotricity boss is also capable for making them the 'world's greenest club'. He has introduced several green changes, including vegan-only food menus. Vince funded the Just Oil protests when activists tied themselves to goalposts. But financial and social sustainability are also of importance to the Forest chief. He is also calling for English football to move itself away from self-regulation.", "text": "Dale Vince says he doesn\u2019t really feel pride. It\u2019s not the way the Forest Green Rovers owner and renewable energy tycoon is wired. He prefers, he says, to look forwards rather than back.\\nIt\u2019s an outlook that\u2019s shaped most of his life. From leaving home at 15 to spend a decade as a New Age Traveller, living in an old fire engine \u2013 later exchanged for an ambulance \u2013 powered by a home-made wind turbine, to launching his own green energy company Ecotricity, building the UK\u2019s first electric supercar, creating diamonds out of thin air, and turning Forest Green Rovers into the world\u2019s first carbon neutral football club.\\n\u2018I\u2019ve always been a contrarian, I guess, and a bit of a rebel,\u2019 Vince tells The Mail on Sunday. \u2018I\u2019ve never pursued money, I\u2019m not interested in that. I pursue change.\u2019\\nSo, it\u2019s a shame, perhaps, as there seems plenty to feel proud about. Not least because he\u2019s steered Rovers, a club from a town of 6,000 on a hill in the middle of Gloucestershire, into the Football League and, following their draw with Bristol Rovers last weekend, promotion to League One.\\nThey might even win League Two on the final day next weekend, although a 3-1 defeat to Harrogate on Saturday was unhelpful to the cause.\\nIf they can secure it, if not pride, what will he feel? \u2018There will be a big smile on my face and in my heart and I will feel pleased that we've made that big step,\u2019 says the 60-year-old. \u2018I'll be looking to firstly survival in League One and then progress up the leagues and hopefully competing for the championship soon.\u2019\\nYou see, always looking forward. And Vince and Rovers have done so while pursuing change off the pitch, too. Since Vince took over in 2010, he\u2019s turned Rovers into, as FIFA describe them, \u2018the greenest club in the world\u2019. Vegan-only menu for players and fans, shirts made from coffee grounds, pitches irrigated from collected rain water and cut by an electric robot mower.\\nVince says he\u2019s seeing more and more players and fans adopting those values into their own lives. They\u2019ve come a long way from opposition fans turning up in butcher\u2019s aprons and singing \u2018you dirty vegan bastard, you\u2019re eating our grass!\u2019\\nRovers made headlines again \u2013 \u2018we\u2019re used to it now\u2019 \u2013 when they travelled to Bristol Rovers in a \u00a3420,000 electric coach. Vince, looking ahead, plans to buy one and thinks the team could use it to get to half of their League One away games next season. He also wants to swap out all of the club\u2019s mowers\u2019 motors for electric ones.\\nAnd there\u2019s the small matter of a proposed new stadium called Eco Park, still a few years away, which will be made entirely of wood. Vince, meanwhile, plans to sell Ecotricity for a move into politics. He has previously donated to the Labour Party.\\nIt was Vince, too, who funded the Just Stop Oil protests last month when activists cabled-tied themselves to goalposts during Premier League matches. He didn\u2019t know that was how they would protest when he handed them \u00a310,000 but would have done anyway. \u2018There's some things that transcend everything, including football.\u2019\\nSustainability runs through everything. And when you are an owner of a football club, in an industry where so many edge close to financial ruin, it\u2019s not just about sustaining the environment.\\n\u2018Sustainability is a broad issue,\u2019 says Vince. \u2018It's also about financial sustainability and social sustainability. You've got to have social justice in anything that you do. Without it, you can't have true sustainability.\u2019\\nIt\u2019s fitting, then, that we\u2019re speaking around the year anniversary of the proposed Super League when the six biggest clubs attempted to break away, only to be shut down by widespread protest.\\n\u2018It crystallized the issue of what actually is it we expect from football as an industry in our country. It turns out we expect more than rampant money-making. And then you've got a Government saying that, actually, the free market can't fix this. So we're going to have some good old state intervention.\u2019\\nThe Government confirmed last week that it will create an independent football regulator, following the recommendations of a fan-led review, to stop unscrupulous owners from buying clubs and running them into the ground. The Premier League say they accept the need for reform but that a regulator \u2018is not necessary\u2019.\\n\u2018It\u2019s a real interesting question because my main day job is in the energy business which has a regulator, and that has been a fucking disaster,\u2019 says Vince. \u2018So, I'm hesitant to say, yes, we should regulate football based on experience.\\n\u2018But football needs something done to it because there are so many clubs every year that run so close to the edge. That's harmful for communities. Self-regulation isn\u2019t working. The fit and proper owner\u2019s test is a breach of the trade description\u2019s act.\\n\u2018Money rules the roost in football, which is all kinds of wrong. It\u2019s like a Wild West version of capitalism. It needs control. I found it really interesting that the government in their report said that the free market can't solve the problems of football. This is a Conservative government that thinks the free market can solve all problems. I was surprised to read that.\u2019\\nIf it\u2019s been a disaster in the energy industry, could it have the same effect on football?\\n\u2018Well, it could, it absolutely could because you tend in a regulator to get a lot of theoretical people and, you know, they are not in touch with what's really needed.\\n\u2018It might be simpler in football. It should be straightforward. They need to, obviously, make sure there's more money coming out of the Premier League into the lower leagues. That would be a very socialist thing to do. I'm loving this new socialist approach to football.\\n\u2018And I would look at a look at wage caps. The Premier League won\u2019t want one, and maybe they can be an exception, but I think they do a lot of good in lower leagues.\u2019\\nMeanwhile, Forest Green keep working their way up them. And, regardless of temptation, Vince will not sacrifice what he believes in to get there. Not even if he had to trade a rasher of meat on the menu for a place in the Premier League.\\n\u2018No way. Absolutely not. I would never swap principles for money. I think the worst thing anybody could do.\u2019", "image": [["Energy tycoon Dale Vince has guided Forest Green Rovers from non-league to League One", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/30/22/57248815-10771301-image-m-147_1651354378896.jpg"], ["The energy chief's club could even win League Two on the last day of the season next weekend", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/30/22/57248783-10771301-image-a-148_1651354704064.jpg"], ["But Vince has also transformed Forest Green into the world's first ever carbon neutral club", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/30/22/57249077-10771301-image-a-149_1651354804569.jpg"], ["They made headlines by travelling away to Bristol Rovers in a \u00a3420,000 electric coach", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/30/22/57249149-10771301-image-a-151_1651355006743.jpg"], ["The Forest owner funded the Just Oil protests which saw fans tie themselves to goalposts last month, although he wasn't aware of how they would campaign", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/30/22/57249085-10771301-image-a-150_1651354934809.jpg"], ["Vince is interested in financial and social sustainability as well as preserving the environment", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/30/22/57249073-10771301-image-a-152_1651355034164.jpg"], ["He is not convinced that football should be regulated on his previous experience in energy", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/30/22/57249179-10771301-image-a-153_1651355105442.jpg"], ["But he insists football needs to change its ways as too many clubs are 'run so close to the edge'", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/30/22/57249177-10771301-image-a-156_1651355211058.jpg"]], "author": ["James Sharpe For The Mail On Sunday"], "date": "2022-04-30"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10730513/Eco-mob-partied-night-RAVE-celebrate-bringing-travel-misery-millions.html": {"title": "Video shows Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil mob downing booze and dancing at all-night RAVE in London's Egg nightclub to celebrate bringing travel misery to millions over 16 days", "subtitle": "Mob of Extinction Rebellion activists parties at an all-night rave in London to celebrate protests.

Email tips@dailymail.com.", "text": "Four green zealots held for chaining themselves inside one of the UK's largest oil refineries yesterday have already walked free - with 11 of their middle class comrades likely to be fast behind them, MailOnline can reveal today.\\nEssex Police has made 373 arrests in the past 12 days - with no charges - and only 11 of them remain in custody\u00a0amid a revolving door of activists\u00a0being arrested and then released to cause more havoc with\u00a0some filling stations now 'drying up' ahead of the Easter getaway.\\nThe final two eco-oafs were finally been arrested after 40 hours having agreed to give police their superglue in return for some water. Louis McKechnie, 21, the 'John Lennon lookalike' ringleader now arrested 16-plus times, said he and fellow student Nathan McGovern, 22, were 'treated well' as they were cut down from inside the rafters of a terminal in Grays, Essex, last night. They are believed to still be in police cells.\\nMinisters are preparing to serve injunctions on the eco-mob ringleaders as Priti Patel\u00a0is again under pressure to take severe action against eco-activists disrupting fuel supplies amid claims the authorities have been too slow to punish them.\\nThe Home Secretary is being told to seek nationwide injunctions to stop 'guerrilla tactics' being used by the group of largely privileged students and professional protesters shutting down oil terminals by chaining themselves to pipes, digging tunnels or blocking tankers to cripple critical UK infrastructure and leave petrol stations without fuel.\\nAs a result petrol and diesel shortages are 'an issue' and some filling stations are 'drying up', according to a fuel price pressure group.\\nHoward Cox, founder of FairFuelUK, said a third of its supporters who responded to a survey last weekend said they have encountered a 'problem' finding fuel. The shortages have been attributed to disruption by Just Stop Oil protesters at oil depots.\\nMr Cox said: 'Some garages are now really drying up. It's very patchy, it's sporadic but it's still an issue, particularly in the South. Most of the protests are happening below the Midlands and in the Home Counties, and that's where we're seeing some of the problems'. He added that in the North, in Scotland and Northern Ireland 'there's no problems whatsoever'.\\nMailOnline revealed yesterday that the Just Stop Oil activists, many of them veterans from the Extinction Rebellion, Animal Rebellion and Insulate Britain movements, include 'John Lennon\u00a0lookalike' McKechnie, who became a poster boy\u00a0after he tied himself to a goalpost to disrupt a\u00a0Premier League\u00a0game at Everton last month.\\nAlso among their group are Cressida Gethin, the privately-educated daughter of an orchestral agent and a former cellist for the London Symphony Orchestra and Miranda Whelehan, 21, a pharmaceuticals expert's daughter who grew up in a \u00a31million, five-bedroom house in Weybridge, Surrey.\\nAnd 'rebel reverend'\u00a0Tim Hewes is in tunnels disrupting a refinery in Warwickshire. He was jailed last year after repeatedly blocking the M25 with the Insulate Britain mob.\\nInjunctions against them would mirror those used last year to ban IB fanatics from blocking roads, allowing police to make arrests more easily - but critics have accused Ms Patel of not being quick enough to act to neuter them.\\nAttorney General Suella Braverman met with cabinet members last night to draw up plans with local councils so they can target specific protesters. Injunctions will be served against them 'within days', according to the Daily Telegraph.\\nOne of the climate change eco activists causing Britain's petrol shortage crisis is a district councillor and former NHS contract manager who boasts online she once protested dressed as a blackbird.\\nBarbi Lund bragged that she has spent 10 days locked to the gates at Purfleet's oil depot in Essex with people from Just Stop Oil.\\nMrs Lund, who came to Britain from South Africa in 1981, represents her ward at Mendip District Council in sleepy Somerset.\\nShe is part of the 'XR Frome Blackbirds' (pictured), who dressed up to campaign to protect nature at the G7 summit protests in Cornwall last summer.\\nWhen not dressed as a giant blackbird, Ms Lund attends XR protests with megaphone in hand. She also holds regular climate change discussions at the Rode Memorial Hall near Frome.\\nIn a video posted onto her Facebook page, she justified her actions at Purfleet, saying: 'Scientific evidence is absolutely clear climate change is a threat to all life on this planet'.\\nRingleader McKechnie, 21, said in a video that the men were being cut down at the Grays oil depot in Essex last night and were the 'last standing'. MailOnline has learned he and Nathan McGovern, 22, were arrested at 9pm last night after 40 hours in the rafters.\\nIn a previous video, McKechnie and McGovern said that they had chained themselves to pipes high up at the site on Sunday afternoon.\\nMcGovern, who studies religion, has previously attempted to tie himself to a goalpost during a match between West Ham and Tottenham and also glued his hand to a microphone during a heated exchange on LBC last weekend.\\nEngineering student McKechnie has also disrupted a football game - between Everton and Newcastle last month.\\nMcKechnie was one of the 'Highway Nine' Insulate Britain\u00a0protesters jailed for blocking the M25 last year and served a three month prison sentence.\\nFigures compiled by the Business Department show that average fuel stock levels at forecourts in England dropped by 5.4 per cent to 36 per cent in the week the Just Stop Oil protests began on March 28.\\nJust Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion activists \u2013 many of them young, middle-class students \u2013 have targeted 11 fuel depots in as many days, blocking trucks from making petrol\u00a0and diesel deliveries to forecourts.\\nThree terminals were targeted over the weekend and trucks had been unable to access the Exolum storage facility in Grays, Essex, after protesters glued themselves to pipes above loading bays.\\nIt came after Downing Street accused the eco-activists of using 'guerilla tactics that obstruct people going about their day-to-day business' and promised a crackdown.\\nIn the strongest statement yet on the eco-mob 'Just Stop Oil', Number 10 yesterday pledged that it would 'not tolerate' those\u00a0obstructing people 'going about their day-to-day business'.\\nResponding to Just Stop Oil's tactics, a No 10 spokeswoman said: 'We recognise the strength of feeling and the right to protest is a cornerstone of our democracy, but we won't tolerate guerrilla tactics that obstruct people going about their day-to-day business.'\\nThe spokeswoman added: 'We fully support the police who are putting significant resource into their response to the demonstrations.'\\nIt came as a furious motorist yesterday revealed how they had to drive 46 miles to fill up because of the disruption to the UK's petrol supplies, while others said they did not have enough fuel to go to work.\\nOne driver, recounting their nightmare journey, told MailOnline:\u00a0'Every petrol station we tried was shut - we drove 11 miles to Aylesbury first and then 17 miles to Bicester before giving up and driving the ten miles back home.\\n'The next day we drove to Winslow which is another eight miles away before finding fuel there. It is total pot luck'.\\nBritain was left in the grips of another fuel crisis, with petrol stations forced to close due to the disruption caused at oil terminals.\\nAround 1,200 pumps south of the midlands were forced to turn away motorists, the Campaign for Fair Fuel claimed on Sunday, in the wake of the action by Just Stop Oil.\\nThe eco protestors have been targeting oil terminals across the south of the country, including in Hertfordshire, Essex and Warwickshire by locking themselves to pipes.\\nThe action has been blamed for shortages of both petrol and diesel at stations compounding misery for drivers already facing record prices at the pump, reported at over \u00a32 a litre in some areas.\\nPriti Patel has called the protesters 'selfish, fanatical and frankly dangerous' while George Eustice, the Environment Secretary, criticised their 'extreme' tactics.\\nCampaign group Fair Fuel said up to a third of petrol stations were closed, while pictures showed some remained shut yesterday.\\nFair Fuel founder Howard Cox told MailOnline supplies remained 'patchy' - with diesel particularly affected - but overall the situation was better than on the weekend.\\nThe AA said that shortages had been 'isolated' and none of its 2,700 patrols had experienced difficulties getting fuel.\\nMeanwhile, the Petrol Retailers Association, which represents around 65% of independently owned forecourts, said:\u00a0'We are aware of protests at several fuel supply sites; however, the majority are unaffected.'\\nSupply issues tend to hit motorists in London and the South East worse than elsewhere.\\nThis is most likely due to the regions' higher population densities, Gordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retailers Association, has previously said.\\nCampaign group Just Stop Oil was on its eleventh day of disruptive protests.\\nA video posted at 3.30am yesterday morning showed one activist at Grays oil depot filming a selfie video from inside a pipe.\\n'We're still in the pipes, still stopping oil, still stopping whatever we non-violently can to resist the collapse of our liveable future,' he said.\\n'We really hope to make it to 24 hours and beyond because that's the only way this government will listen.\\n'This corrupt government that is pushing us towards not just a climate catastrophe but a social crisis.\\n'We're in the depths of a cost of living emergency... we're in the depths of a legitimacy crisis and unless Boris Johnson gets on with the job and stops oil and legitimacy crisis will extend to the entire global system'.\\nYesterday, Environment Secretary George Eustice said: 'A right to protest is important but not if it's causing havoc with other people's lives. That's wrong and not acceptable.\\n'We all recognise that we need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels... this is a mainstream agenda, people really don't need to do these extreme protests to get their point heard.'\\nMass protests have resulted in more than 800 arrests across the country and have put a 'real strain' on local police services.\\nThe protests are exacerbating existing supply issues due to increased demand after Covid lockdowns and Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\\nThe Insulate Britain injunctions, applied for at the High Court by roads agency National Highways, effectively banned protests on major roads.\\nIt meant activists could be arrested for contempt of court for breaking the injunctions.\\nLabour said ministers should work with local authorities covering the country's 60-odd oil terminals to bring in similar measures. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman yesterday insisted the Government will not tolerate continued disruption.\\nThe mayhem comes ahead of a record 21.5million motorists preparing to take to the roads this coming Easter weekend. Steve Reed, Labour's justice spokesman, said: 'The Conservatives need to stop standing idly by and put an end to this disruption that is causing misery for motorists.'\\nHe said: 'We recognise the strength of feeling and that the right to protest is a cornerstone of our democracy, but we won't tolerate guerrilla tactics that obstruct people going about their day-to-day business.'\\nEssex Police made nine more arrests yesterday, following 26 on Sunday.\\nAssistant Chief Constable Rachel Nolan blasted the 'totally unacceptable' activists who have trespassed into areas holding flammable chemicals.\\nShe said: 'Their risky behaviour cannot be allowed to take place in such critical locations which could be catastrophic if there were accidental or deliberate actions causing leakage or fire.' Just Stop Oil is an off-shoot of Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion and contains many of the same members.\\nMinisters had planned to introduce new powers to help police tackle eco-protesters but the measures were blocked in the House of Lords in January.\\nAt the time, Miss Patel accused Labour of siding with 'vandals and thugs'.\\nProposed measures had included an offence of 'locking on' in a bid to stop protesters resorting to the common tactic of chaining themselves to buildings and vehicles.\\nNew stop and search powers were also proposed to allow police to detain protesters arriving carrying bike locks and other equipment designed to make themselves difficult to remove.\\nMinisters are expected to try to revive the measures in the next Queen's Speech.\\nJust Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion fanatics claimed to have dug a tunnel under a tankerroute in a bid to block deliveries to forecourts.\\nThe West Midlands and East of England were the worst affected regions, with average stocks finishing the week ending April 3 on 25 per cent.\\nA spokesman for the UK Petroleum Industry Association, whose members include Shell, BP and ExxonMobil, said disruptions are 'localised and short-term only'.\\nA government spokesman said: 'We are working closely with industry to ensure that supplies are maintained.'\\nThe green zealots trying to make Britain run out of fuel are a bunch of privileged students and professional protesters, MailOnline can reveal today.\\nActivists from Just Stop Oil have been hampering access to petrol and diesel for days, demanding that the Government stops new fossil fuel projects by digging tunnels below refineries, vandalising tankers or storming the terminals to climb on to the pipes.\\nEssex Police has arrested more than 350 protesters since the disruption started on April 1 - while queues have formed at petrol stations across the country and some have even shut down due to a shortage of fuel.\\nOne of the ringleaders is 'John Lennon lookalike' Louis McKechnie, a Bournemouth University graduate who became a poster boy for JSO after he tied himself to a goalpost to disrupt a Premier League\u00a0game at Everton last month.\\nAround\u00a012 students remain within the pipes at Grays Inter Terminal today, including former boarding school choir girl and now Cambridge University student Cressie\u00a0Gethin. With her in the rafters is\u00a0student Nathan McGovern, another golden boy of the movement.\\nAlso manning the barricades are Brighton-based activist Hannah Hunt, 23, another student with a taste for expensive hobbies and travel, and Eben Lazarus, who describes himself as a 'musician and activist'.\\nAnd in the tunnels below the BP Kingsbury Oil Terminal in Warwickshire is retired vicar Tim Hewes, a veteran of the Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain movement who also sewed his lips together in protest against Rupert Murdoch.\\nOther members of the Just Stop Oil group, which is closely linked to the Extinction Rebellion, Animal Rebellion and Insulate Britain groups, is a rollerskating watchmaker and JSO's official 'de-escalator', XR's 'arts co-ordinator' and a Welsh organic farmer whose family business failed and he blamed climate change.\\nThese are the protesters at the heart of the current chaos that is leaving millions of Britons short on fuel:\\nThe Lennon-lookalike posterboy: Louis McKechnie\\nLouis McKechnie, 21, an engineering student, was charged with pitch encroachment and aggravated trespass after the incident at Goodison Park during the game between Everton and Newcastle United last month.\\nHe stormed the pitch halfway through the match and zip-tied himself to the goalpost wearing a bright orange t-shirt saying: 'Just stop oil.' Louis has said he has received 'hundreds' of death threats since running on to the pitch.\\nMcKechnie is a Bournemouth University student whose activism began with\u00a0Extinction Rebellion (XR) in 2020 before he joined vegan group Animal Rebellion.\\nThe 21-year-old, whose experience of work appears to be only stints with a local fish-and-chip shop and supermarket, was one of the 'Highway Nine' Insulate Britain protesters jailed for blocking the M25 last year.\\nAfter serving half of a three-month prison sentence, he warned: 'What comes next will make Insulate Britain look like child's play.'\\nPharmaceuticals expert's daughter who grew up in \u00a31million house: Miranda Whelehan\\nMiranda Whelehan was among around 20 activists from Just Stop Oil who blocked tankers arriving at Kingsbury oil terminal in Warwickshire.\\nAn undergraduate in International Development with French at the University of Sussex, she is the daughter of a cyber-security expert at multinational pharmaceuticals firm GSK and grew up in a \u00a31million five-bedroom house in Weybridge, Surrey.\\nMiss Whelehan appeared on Good Morning Britain yesterday attempting to justify the protests.\\nQuizzed by presenter Richard Madeley, she insisted that 'I don't think any of us want to be disrupting people's lives'.\\nBut she said that 'given the science', it was 'the level of action that needs to be taken when our Government is failing on their energy policies and their climate pledges'.\\nThe interview threatened to descend into farce when Madeley suggested the group's name was 'very Vicky Pollard' and 'childish'.\\nIn response, she argued that its demand was simple - for ministers to say 'no to new oil'.\\nHowever some viewers complained his questioning had become 'bullying' after he began pointing out that the clothes she was wearing would probably have been delivered to the shops in vans or lorries.\\nLater, while accepting that civil disobedience were 'not popular', she insisting that future generations would regard them as 'heroic'.\\n'What we must do now is block and disable the cogs of the fossil-fuel machine,' she wrote in the Independent.\\nRebel reverend: Tim Hewes\\nReverend Hewes, who once sewed up his lips in protest at the influence of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, was also repeatedly part of the mob blocking the M25 despite already being arrested numerous times.\\nThe activist has 'permission to officiate' in the Diocese of Oxford although he does not have a parish, and is today in tunnels under an oil tanker route.\\nAsked about Rev Hewes last year, a spokesman for the diocese said: 'The actions of Rev Hewes and others, while arguably well-intentioned, have frustrated many people and we're unclear how the actions have been productive in encouraging the urgent change required.'\\nRev Hewes, a retired dentist, previously said the Bishop of Dorchester, Gavin Collins, who comes under the Diocese of Oxford, had told him 'he does support issues regarding climate change and the environment but not about breaking the law'.\\nToday he is in a tunnel under a key tanker route to the BP Kingsbury Terminal in Warwickshire.\\nHe said: 'I'm here because our government is useless, they make a lot of noise but they are doing nothing.\\n'As a priest I have a duty of care for people, and also for creation. What I'm doing here, with everyone in this caravan, is what our government should be doing \u2013 that is trying to protect our families and our loved ones from the appalling future that stands before us.\\n'I hope we can continue what we're doing and stop the flow of oil, if the government won't.'\\nThe jetsetting yachtswoman: Hannah Hunt\\nThe JSO protester is from Brighton, a common home town for Green zealots.\\nMiss Hunt is a former XR supporter who broke into an ExxonMobil Oil refinery in Hampshire. She also posed with Mr\u00a0McKechnie outside Downing Street with a letter for Boris Johnson.\\nShe also glued herself to the red carpet at the Bafta awards and admits to experiencing severe anxiety before a protest. But describing her state after starting she said she enjoys 'a weird, dreamy, calm mindset' she finds empowering.\\nThe Brighton-based activist studied at Sussex University, where she joined the sailing team. Her Instagram shows her holidaying in locations including Australia, Greece, Gran Canaria and Bali.\\nShe is currently in the rafters of the Grays refinery, with\u00a0Eben Lazarus, a musician and activist also from Brighton.\u00a0Sharing a video she said they were 'cold and uncomfortable' 17 hours into their protest, but added: 'But that suffering is minute compared to those in the frontline of the climate crisis'.\\nEben then encourages people to 'step up' and join protests because 'nobody can be a bystander if we want any chance of a future'.\\nXR's 'arts-co-ordinator': Indigo Rumbelow\\nEco-fanatic Indigo Rumbelow, 27, from Gower, South-West Wales, has been arrested at least five times. In a Zoom call watched by The Mail on Sunday last week, she told activists: 'We want to create sustained disruption for two weeks.'\\nDescribing her motivations, Miss Rumbelow said: 'My generation is being forced into action because our Government is destroying our future. We will immediately end all actions when it makes a statement that it will stop all new oil and gas.'\\nIndigo was first arrested at Cannes Lions Advertising Festival in 2019 for gate-crashing a Facebook conference and has been held by police on at least six occasions since then.\\nIn 2020 she began digging up the lawn in front of the Ministry for Housing Communities and Local Government and was arrested again in Parliament Square later that year when she blocked the road.\\nJustifying her behaviour recently she said: 'The only thing to do in a system that is driving itself to extinction is to rebel. If we look at the history books, we can see that the only way of creating the nonlinear change we need is for people to commit civil disobedience and force that change.\\n'Currently too few people are taking the necessary action. I urge anyone reading this article to realise that they too can rebel. In order to prevent ecosystem and societal collapse, at this pivotal moment in history, ordinary people need to take extra-ordinary action'.\\nThe rollerskating watchmaker: Amy Rugg-Easey\\nMiss Rugg-Easey was involved in shutting down Tower Bridge last Friday.\\nShe and an unnamed man threw themselves off the bridge using abseil ropes and tiers a giant 'End fossil fuels now' banner.\\nThe Labour-voting voting watchmaker and rollerskater from Newcastle upon Tyne describes herself as a 'rebel for life'.\\nDescribing her descent into eco-activism she said: 'I quit my career in watchmaking to study environmental science after listening to science podcasts while working at my bench. I remember thinking at the time 'it can't be that bad'. Climate change was something that you heard about every now again in the news as if it was the weather. When I really started to look at the facts, I started to panic. I felt a need to do something about it.\\nWhen I began my degree, I had already been to a few Extinction Rebellion meetings and their famous 'heading for extinction' talk. 'It can't be that bad' I thought. I'd hoped that when I started studying, the things I would learn would show that that talk had been a huge exaggeration. Unfortunately, that was not the case'.\\nDescribing the abseiling stunt she said: 'I was terrified stepping off that bridge. I decided to put my name out and wear my signature blue jacket hoping that people I've met would recognise me and realise that climate activists are just normal people too. I also know that it creates a target on my back. Certain people will wish that I'd died on that bridge today. I know that it makes my mum worry.\\n'I'm hoping my actions inspires others to be brave and take their first steps in fighting for our future. Not everyone has to hang off a bridge and get arrested, but everyone has to take meaningful action for things to change'.\\nThe Cambridge music student:\u00a0Cressie Gethin\\nMiss Gethin, a former student of the prestigious\u00a0Hereford Cathedral School, is currently among the group holding up the Grays refinery.\u00a0She appears to be one of the five main founders of Just Stop Oil.\\nCressie, a music student from Murray Edwards at Cambridge University, has been campaigning on climate issues at her college.\\nShe told The Tab: 'I was very very surprised that Murray Edwards came out bottom of the league tables for their climate policies because I had imagined it was something they would have cared about and been active on'.\\nThe talented chorister has performed with her brother, also a singer.\\nThe LBC mic gluer:\u00a0Nathan McGovern\\n22-year-old King's College London student Nathan McGovern, who studies religion. The Coventry activist has flirted with XR and Animal Rebellion and disrupted a game at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\\nEight days ago he was speaking to Tom Swarbrick in LBC's Westminster studio when he glued his hand to the microphone at around 11.40am.\\nMr McGovern said that the station was 'not using' its 'massive platform' to inform listeners of the dangers of the climate crisis\\nSpeaking live, Mr McGovern said to Mr Swarbrick: 'You have a massive platform, a microphone that you can use to tell people about the situation we're in and you're not using it.\\n'An ordinary person like me is having to take the microphone and tell your viewers the situation we are in.'\\nThe LBC presenter said: 'For those of you listening wondering what the banging on the microphone is, Mr McGovern seems to have, you've glued yourself to the microphone? That's fantastic.'\\nAfter the incident, LBC presenter and Daily Mail columnist Andrew Pierce took over the live programme from Global's Leicester Square, before handing back to Mr Swarbrick when arrived there.\\nDuring this time, Mc McGovern was left in the studio in the dark while waiting for police to arrive.\\nHe appeared as a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion advocating a 'plant-based food system' on Nigel Farage's GB News show in October 2021.\\nAfter the disruption, the group tweeted: 'Every new oil and gas facility tightens the noose around the necks of our young people. If the media will not communicate their predicament they will have no choice but to take the microphone.'\\nJust Stop Oil's official 'de-escalator':\u00a0Pavel Ivanov\\nMr Ivanov is billed as an expert in diffusing rows that break out at the protests when JSO's members shut down roads, for example.\\nSpeaking to The Guardian he described the 'astonishing' abuse they suffer, in a tacit admission that they are struggling to win over many of their critics.\\nIn one incident linked to the blockading of oil refineries, one driver who had protesters on his roof said: 'If the police weren't here, I'd come up and f**king throw you off myself.'\\nAnother activist with a ladder was told: 'You put that up there, mate, and I'm going to ram it down your f**king throat'.\\nMr Ivanov claims n one occasion someone got him by the throat as friends were heckled: 'You look like you're just out of nappies. Go and get a f**king job'.\\nJSO's graphic designer who won't have a baby until she tries to 'fix the world':\u00a0\u00a0Gabriella Ditton\\nAnother JSO activist is graphic designer Gabriella Ditton, 27, from Norfolk, who was arrested for blocking oil trucks on Friday.\\nIn a newspaper interview, Ms Ditton \u2013 who attended Wymondham College in Norfolk, where annual boarding fees are more than \u00a312,000 \u2013 bragged: 'I've been arrested 16 times and it's honestly fine.' She has stripped naked and covered her body in oil at protests.\\nThe group said last week: 'Gabriella would love nothing more than to have a family and continue her career as a graphic designer, but feels those things aren't an option for her anymore because of the state of the world'.\\nThe 27-year-old, who works as an animator, became hooked after going to an Extinction Rebellion talk. She said: 'I was getting my life in order to have a baby and went to the Heading for Extinction talk. I realised I couldn't bring a baby into the world before trying to fix it first.\\n'I started the way everyone does, with petitions, emailing my MP, going on marches. But I realised it doesn't work. In the future, I want to be able to say with total sincerity that I did everything I could and really mean it.

says that and yet this Government and this energy strategy .. is foreseeing getting out even more oil and gas from the North Sea, that is frankly immoral and said the UN general secretary said that is

working hard to minimise the dangers this morning.\\n'Put simply: we don't want anyone to get hurt.'\\nThe force has said that policing protests in Thurrock has cost Essex Police 'in excess of \u00a31

unacceptable'.\\nThe impact of the protests is being felt by the people of Essex and beyond, he said.\\nHe added: 'We've been lucky to have extra support from specialist officers from across the country, to support some of our officers continuing with their day jobs.'\\nThe force is working with organisations including Thurrock Council, the East of England Ambulance Service, Essex County Fire and Rescue Service plus the local fuel companies to try over the protests while also having to deal with local crime.\\nWarwickshire Police said that a further 29 arrests have been made this weekend in connection with ongoing protests at Kingsbury Oil Terminal.\\nThose in custody have been arrested for offences including criminal damage, conspiracy to cause criminal damage and conspiracy to commit public nuisance in what Assistant Chief Constable Ben Smith described as 'another busy weekend' for the force.\\nThis takes the total number of arrests to 180 since the protests began on April 1.\\nMr Smith, who said there would be a heightened police presence at the site over the coming days, added: 'This weekend's protest activity has been contained to the Piccadilly Way area and has caused little disruption to the wider community, or to the operations of the oil terminal.\\n'While we will always recognise and respect the public's right to peaceful protest, we will take action against anyone who breaks the law or causes significant impact on the local community.'\\nHe thanked the public for their ongoing patience and said the force is working to minimise disruption to the local community and the road networks.\\nOvernight, Just Stop Oil supporters claim they dug a tunnel by concealing its efforts with a caravan under a key tanker route to the BP Kingsbury Terminal in Warwickshire.\\nDespite a number of police arrests, Just Stop Oil claim five people remain inside the caravan this morning working on the tunnel.\\nReverend Tim Hughes, 71 a retired priest from Swindon, who is with the tunnellers, said: 'I'm here because our government is useless, they make a lot of noise but they are doing nothing.\\n'As a priest I have a duty of care for people, and also

major traffic arteries across the Thames.\\nOvernight, Just Stop Oil supporters claim they dug a tunnel by concealing its efforts with a caravan under a key tanker route to the BP Kingsbury Terminal in Warwickshire.\\nDespite a number of police arrests, Just Oil claim, five people remain inside the caravan this morning working on the tunnel.\\nReverend Tim Hughes, 71 a retired priest from Swindon, who is with the tunnellers, said:\u00a0'I'm here because our government is useless, they make a lot of noise but they are doing nothing.\\n'As a priest I have a duty of care for people, and also for creation.\\n'What I'm doing here, with everyone in this caravan, is what our government should be doing \u2013 that is trying to protect our families and our loved ones from the appalling future that stands before us.\\n'I hope we can continue what we're doing and stop the flow of oil, if the government won't.'\\nAt around 2:30am today, 40 people approached the gates of the Buncefield oil terminal in Hertfordshire and locked on, blocking the entrance.\\nAnd at 6:30am, the Grays Inter Terminal in Thurrock was swarmed by 40 people who climbed the loading bay pipework and locked themselves in.\\nEssex police - who have made 338 arrests in seven days - say they are currently dealing with 26 people at the site and say other sites are operational.\\nCrowds sat in the middle of the road, waving multicoloured flags bearing the group's 'extinction' symbol and placards that read 'there is no planet B' and 'we want to live' while listening to music and speakers in sunny weather.\\nAfter several hours, police first cleared Lambeth and then Vauxhall Bridge, saying 38 arrests were made in the process.\\nOfficers told protesters there was evidence they were causing 'serious disruption' to the public, warning them to leave or face arrest.\\nDoctors and nurses from a small group of medical workers who refused to leave Lambeth Bridge were among those arrested, Extinction Rebellion tweeted.\\nThe Met said it had imposed conditions under section 14 of the Public Order Act 1986 on Extinction Rebellion to clear areas around Vauxhall Bridge.\\nProtestors did allow ambulances and fire engines to pass, with organisers parting the crowd by shouting 'blue light'.\\nAssistant Chief Constable Glen Pavelin said: 'We cannot stand by while criminal acts are being committed, and lives are being put at risk, in the name of protest.\\n'Today's protest is exceptionally dangerous due to where the protestors have located themselves within the site.'\\n'Our officers have been diligent in ensuring that all protesters know the risks involved, and we've been working hard to minimise the dangers this morning.\\n'Put simply: we don't want anyone to get hurt.'\\nHe added: 'We've been lucky to have extra support from specialist officers from across the country, to support some of our officers continuing with their day jobs.'\\nThe force is working with organisations including Thurrock Council, the East of England Ambulance Service, Essex County Fire and Rescue Service plus the local fuel companies to try over the protests while also having to deal with local crime.\\nWarwickshire Police said that a further 29 arrests have been made this weekend in connection with ongoing protests at Kingsbury Oil Terminal.\\nThose in custody have been arrested for offences including criminal damage, conspiracy to cause criminal damage and conspiracy to commit public nuisance in what Assistant Chief Constable Ben Smith described as 'another busy weekend' for the force.\\nThis takes the total number of arrests to 180 since the protests began on April 1.\\nMr Smith, who said there would be a heightened police presence at the site over the coming days, added: 'This weekend's protest activity has been contained to the Piccadilly Way area and has caused little disruption to the wider community, or to the operations of the oil terminal.\\n'While we will always recognise and respect the public's right to peaceful protest, we will take action against anyone who breaks the law or causes significant impact on the local community.'\\nHe thanked the public for their ongoing patience and said the force is working to minimise disruption to the local community and the road networks.\\nThe BP station in Ely, Cambridgeshire was closed and the Tesco petrol station also in Ely had long queues before they finally ran out on Sunday morning.\\nEarlier in the week, the action has cost Essex police \u00a31m, a senior officer has said.\\nHe called on fuel firms to bring in private security while forecourts start to close after running dry.\\nDeputy Chief Constable Andy Prophet said Essex Police is working closely with fuel distribution companies and strongly encouraging them to reinforce their security plans at each site.\\nHe said the 'commitment' of officers 'has allowed us to maintain a 24/7 presence in the area throughout the last week'.\\n'This has not eliminated the disruption but has kept it to a minimum,' he said. 'Fuel transportation has continued and there is no need for any panic buying.\\n'This has put a real strain on the force.\\n'One of the things I'm focused on is what more the fuel companies can do to protect their infrastructure, perhaps using private security.\\n'If those measures are put in place, policing can deal with these incidents quicker and further reduce the disruption being caused.\\n'We know the people of Essex would prefer officers to be able to focus on the job of stopping crime and arresting criminals and to be perfectly honest, so do I.\\n'To be clear, we are not in any way anti-protest; there is a right to protest but there is no right to commit crime.'\\nIt is expected that this morning's actions will continue to significantly impact on fuel availability at petrol pumps across the South East and the Midlands.\\nIt comes as the AA yesterday pleaded with drivers to fill up their cars as normal and to avoid rushing to petrol stations - even if they see that their local garages are closed on social media.\\nDrivers in Cornwall, Newport Wales, Essex and Hertfordshire have all reported having difficulties filling up their tanks today.\\nKiel wrote on Twitter that the 'world won't stop using' petrol because people are 'chaining themselves' in a 'stupid move'.\\nNicholas Till also urged in 'sending in the army' to address the issues with petrol up and down the country.\\nAsh said he totally understood the climate emergency but getting to work was going to be difficult, especially for people already struggling.\\nBaz said: 'When will the government crackdown on this as it's causing misery for normal people trying to get to work.'\\nIt comes as working Britons face a hike in National Insurance, and soaring food and energy prices as Boris Johnson admitted families face 'tough times' and will have to 'choose' where to cut back spending.\\nIt comes as UK motorists continue to suffer at the pumps with petrol prices hitting record levels in recent weeks after\u00a0Brent crude oil hit a high of $128 (\u00a398) last month.\\nThis comes as the cost of diesel and petrol increased at pumps with some garages charging over \u00a32/litre.\\nChancellor Rishi Sunak tried to mitigate the effects of price rises as he last month begged petrol stations to pass on a 5p fuel duty cut at the pumps that he delivered in his Spring Statement.\\nAsda, Sainsburys and Tesco were among the major supermarkets to confirm they would pass on the cut in prices, with a 6p decrease in petrol and diesel.\\nThis however represents only a fraction in the price rises seen since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February.\\nThe 5p cut in fuel duty was blasted by UK motoring groups as a 'drop in the ocean' for hard-pressed drivers as pump prices continue to hit record levels.\\nThe\u00a0UK Petroleum Industry Association (UKPIA) has said issues in Russia and the protests will not 'stop fuels getting to the users who need it'.\\nA UK Petroleum Industry Association (UKPIA) spokesperson said: 'Fuel supplies underpin the economy and it is important that any protest does not stop fuels getting to the users who need it, especially the emergency services and other critical workers.\\n'The UK's oil products are sourced from a diverse range of suppliers including the UK's own refineries and imports from across the globe.\\n'The restrictions on Russian owned, controlled, chartered and operated vessels are understood by fuel importers, and companies that have previously used such vessels are implementing contingency plans such as using alternatives to ensure products continue to be available.'\\nExtinction Rebellion have also promised two weeks of rebellion in London as they want to bring carnage to the capital and create more roadblocks than ever.\\nKicking off their demonstration in Hyde Park, XR has also started blocking off major roads nearby. It promises its civil resistance and full disobedience will be felt across the city from midday.\\n\\nThousands of Extinction Rebellion protesters including an Olympic gold medallist staged a sit-down protest in Oxford Street and Regent Street, yesterday, blocking traffic in the heart of London's shopping district to call for no new investment in fossil fuels.\\nThe eco-protestors sat down across Oxford Circus and the famous high streets it connects, chanting 'save our planet' and 'whose streets, our streets'.", "image": [["And at 6.30am, the Grays Inter Terminal in Thurrock was swarmed by 40 people who climbed the loading bay pipework and locked themselves in (pictured)", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/10/15/56436441-10704779-And_at_6_30am_the_Grays_Inter_Terminal_in_Thurrock_was_swarmed_b-a-32_1649601199299.jpg"], ["Police officers remove a protester glued to Lambeth Bridge in central London earlier today.

I\u2019ve been all over the place and ended up having to come home on empty.'\\nAnother said late last night: 'No petrol in London petrol stations. Tried four petrol stations all closed.'\\nMeanwhile Balan Nadarajah, manager at Abingdon BP garage in Oxfordshire, told the Oxford Mail that the petrol station had completely run out of diesel, adding that he suspects the blockades are to blame.\\nHe said: 'We haven't got any diesel at all; we only have 4,000 litres of unleaded which we will probably run out of today.\\n'Hopefully we will have a delivery, but we haven't had any news from BP yet.'\\nA store manager from a BP on Launton Road told the paper:\u00a0'We don't know when we're getting our next lot of fuel. We'll be out of everything in the next 20 minutes.'\\nIt comes as the AA today pleaded with drivers to fill up their cars as normal and to avoid rushing to petrol stations - even if they see that their local garages are closed on social media.\\nA spokesperson told MailOnline: 'If you have half a tank, just wait until tomorrow or Monday to fill it up, there's no need to rush to the station.\\n'If your station is closed, you will probably find another one near you that isn't.'\\nHe added: 'While the blockades have undoubtedly had an impact, the closures appear to be localised and not nationwide.\\n'The only impact they've had so far is the equivalent of a bad storm, the fuel industry is more than capable of dealing with such disruptions.\\n'The great thing about oil tankers is that they're mobile and can simply unload at other ports which aren't being targeted.'\\nThe spokesman said the closures have been partly caused by the fact that it is the weekend, particularly as families are looking to get away for Easter.\\nHe urged people not to panic if they see a picture of a closed petrol station on social media.\\n'The blockaders want to make the whole system fall down,' he said, 'they want to see petrol stations run out of fuel by making people rush to fill up their cars.\\n'While they have had some impact, the fuel deliveries eventually get through.'\\nClimate protestors Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion teamed up to blockade key terminals this week, meaning some tanker drivers were not able to deliver fuel to station depots.\\nThey say they want to disrupt fuel supplies to London and the South East of England and will continue until the Government agrees to stop all new fossil fuel investments.\\nThe protests are exacerbating existing supply issues due to increased demand after Covid lockdowns and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\\nIt comes as working Britons face a hike in National Insurance and soaring food and energy prices as Boris Johnson admitted families face 'tough times' and will have to 'choose' where to cut back spending.\\nAnd from today, the group are planning new 'rebellions' which will start at London's Hyde Park and then spread throughout the capital - saying that they will be 'impossible to ignore'.\\n'We are getting a lot of reports to us and on social media of fuel shortages across the country,' they told MailOnline on Friday.\\nWhen asked about the chaos caused by the group's protests, the spokesperson said they felt 'no choice but to act' to pressure the government into cutting off Britain's reliance on fuel.\\n'The Government can end the misery of empty filling stations immediately by making a statement to end new oil and gas,' they said.\\nSeveral of the ports most affected are in Essex where people have been attaching themselves to fuel tankers with glue and bike locks.\\nExtinction Rebellion protesters have shut down Tower Bridge by abseiling off the sides of the London landmark.\\nTwo activists are hanging from the bridge by suspension cords and have unfurled a huge banner that reads: 'End fossil fuels now.'\\nThe bridge, a main traffic artery across the Thames, is closed to vehicles, causing long queues.\\nThe pair hung the banner at 7am on Friday and also released red flares.\\nThe Metropolitan Police said officers were called to the bridge at 7.30am and no arrests have been made.\\nExtinction Rebellion said: 'The action has taken place at the gateway to the City of London - the root source of fossil fuel funding in the UK - and on the eve of the April Rebellion which begins tomorrow at 10am in Hyde Park.'\\nAmy Rugg-Easey, who is taking part in the demonstration, said: 'I ask myself why I do these things all the time, and the main thing that drives me is that I have tremendous hope and optimism in humanity's ability to fight the climate crisis - but there are certain people who continue to prevent that for their own profit.\\nChafford Hundred, West Thurrock and the Purfleet Fuels Terminals are among the\u00a010 'critical' sites that have been blocked across the country.\\nThe operation has cost more than \u00a31 million since last Friday, according to Essex's Deputy Chief Constable Andy Prophet, and more protestors have continued to arrive.\\nBy Friday, some 268 people have now been arrested by Essex Police alone.\\nSeven of the ten protests were carried out by Just Stop Oil at Navigator Terminals Thames, Inter Terminals UK and Purfleet Fuels Terminal all in Grays; Buncefield Oil Depot in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire; Esso Petroleum in Tyburn, Birmingham; and Kingsbury Oil Terminal and BP Oil Depot, both in Tamworth, Staffordshire.\\nThe further three were organised by Extinction Rebellion demonstrators at the Esso West Terminal near London Heathrow Airport, Hamble Terminals in Southampton and Hythe Terminal in Fawley, Hampshire.\\nIn a tweet by Extinction Rebellion's Cambridge branch the group shared photos of fuel 'running dry across Cambridge'.\\n'@JustStop_Oil and @XRebellionUK are blockading oil terminals across the UK.\\n'Shown here are petrol stations in Sainsbury's Coldhams Lane, Tesco Fulbourn, and BP Elizabeth Way and Cherry Hinton.'\\nThe Petrol Retailers Association said: 'We are aware of protests at a number of fuel supply sites; however the majority of terminals are currently unaffected.\\n'PRA has not had any members contacting regarding supply issues. Some fuel suppliers are having to reschedule deliveries and our members are working closely with them and following their advice.'\\nFuel prices have risen to record highs in recent weeks, with some garages and forecourts charging more than \u00a32/litre for diesel at one point.\\nChancellor Rishi Sunak tried to mitigate the effects of price rises as he last month begged petrol stations to pass on a 5p fuel duty cut at the pumps that he delivered in his Spring Statement.\\nAsda, Sainsburys and Tesco were among the major supermarkets to confirm they would pass on the cut in prices, with a 6p decrease in petrol and diesel.\\nThis however represents only a fraction in the price rises seen since the Russian invasion of Ukraine\u00a0 in late February.\\nThe 5p cut in fuel duty was blasted by UK motoring groups as a 'drop in the ocean' for hard-pressed drivers as pump prices continue to hit record levels.\\nFrom this weekend it is believed the groups' focus will shift towards\u00a0'mass daily protests' in London to be led by Extinction Rebellion activists.\\nThe campaign group, also known as XR, will hold its latest 'rebellions' from April 9 starting at Hyde Park and then spreading throughout the capital.\\nProtests are also planned in Birmingham and Southampton and 'non-violent direct action training' will be given.\\nXR spokesman Andrew Smith said: 'From Saturday April 9 we will meet at 10am in Hyde Park every day. We will be easy to find, we will be easy to join, we will be more disruptive than ever, and we will be impossible to ignore.\\n'We're expecting huge numbers from the 9th. In London we won't have pink boats, we won't have pink tables, we will just have people power.\\n'In the tradition of non-violent civil disobedience, we will disrupt business as usual until the Government and big business make change. We need everyone to join us.'\\nHe continued: 'We're looking at more mass participation-style events, rather than small kind of scattergun actions which rebellions have previously consisted of. We're looking at mass participation, which are easy to join.\\n'We're asking the public to step up and join us.\u00a0We know at the moment that across the country, people are feeling kind of disenfranchised with how they've been treated by the Government.\\n'The energy crisis is really starting to hit home on people, and people really want us to step up into a space where their voice is heard.\\n'We're offering them the space where they can come and participate and join with us.\\n'Every morning we'll be offering non-violent direct action training, where we will encourage people to step up and be empowered to take action with us and speak out against Government inaction.\u00a0As a response to that, the actions will feel and look very different to previous rebellions.", "image": [["Many petrol stations across the south of the UK are closed after running out of petrol and diesel following days of disruption from Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil, who glued themselves to roads at major depots, chained themselves to pipes and trucks and even crawled through a depot's tunnel network in Essex.
