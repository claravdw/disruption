She was also involved in the vigil, announcing it had been officially cancelled due to Covid rules.\\nAs part of Scotland Yard's Crime Prevention, Inclusion & Engagement Command, she took a role in Covid enforcement, advising religious leaders not to hold clandestine services after a church minister was threatened with arrest if he held a baptism.\\nDAC Connors was also the officer in charge when officers were filmed raving with Extinction Rebellion demonstrators at a rave at Oxford Circus, London, in 2019.\\nToday a Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: 'The Special Enquiry Team will lead the investigations. DAC Jane Connors will oversee the investigation in her role as the Met's lead officer for Covid.'\\nThe announcement comes as Scotland Yard chief Dame Cressida Dick announced that the force would probe the alleged lockdown breaches after being provided evidence by Sue Gray's civil service inquiry.\\nDAC Connors\u00a0began working in the east London boroughs of Hackney, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest before transferring to Westminster to run proactive crime teams, according to a profile for charity Joining Against Cancer in Kids, of which she is a trustee.\\nShe also spent time in charge of call centres managing the Met's 101 and 999 calls, the charity website said.\\nThe profile says she was promoted to the rank of commander in 2018, and by 2020 was in charge of violence reduction.\\nBy late 2021 she had attained her current rank.\\nThe officer will now oversee the Metropolitan Police's special inquiry team in their investigation into alleged rule-breaking Downing Street parties.\\nThe team has been in existence in a number of forms for about 20 years and carries out sensitive and confidential inquiries into matters relating to high profile figures, including those in politics.\\nIt was originally a unit within the Economic and Serious Crime Command that dealt with fraud and corruption offences in the public sector.\\nBut in 2013, following restructuring within the Met, the unit was transferred to the Homicide and Major Command.\\nPart of its role is to investigate allegations of offences committed by those in public office or on the parliamentary estate.\\nIn the past, the special inquiry team investigated allegations of bribery, perjury, theft, misconduct in public office, perverting the course of justice, electoral fraud and malpractice, blackmail, harassment, malicious communications and offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act.\\nLast year the lead investigator was embroiled in a row over the vigil that was held for Sarah Everard in Clapham Common.\\nPolice faced heavy criticism and the Met's Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick was under pressure to resign after officers were seen pinning people to the ground and using heavy-handed tactics.\\nFootage showed officers yelling 'move back' as they shoved protesters away as other demonstrators were hauled off by police.\\nCrowds of mourners started chanting 'arrest your own' and 'shame on you' as the vigil quickly turned violent.\\nFollowing the scenes, DAC Connors said while she understood why 'people need to express their views' the force had to 'take some enforcement action as the evening progressed'.\\nShe said:\u00a0'Whilst I understand why people feel the need to express their views at this time, we must remember that we are still in the middle of a pandemic, and that there is the constant risk of transmitting the coronavirus.\\n'Our officers were once again out on the streets, with the primary role of trying to ensure people's safety during this health crisis.\\n'Despite many people adhering to officers' instructions to leave the area and go home, we had to take some enforcement action as the evening progressed.'\\nHer comments came as\u00a0police federation chief Ken Marsh\u00a0defended the actions of officers at the vigil and claimed the event had been 'hijacked' by Antifa, Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion protesters.\\nIn July last year the deputy assistant commissioner firmly rejected claims that the Met's operation had 'failed' after crowds of football fans stormed the Wembley Stadium during the Euros.\\nResponding to the criticism she said: 'I want to praise the quick response by police commanders and those brave officers who confronted these subsequent scenes of disorder and violence.\\n'I am in no doubt that their swift action prevented any further escalation.\\n'Frustratingly, 19 of our officers were injured during the course of Sunday's policing operation when confronting volatile crowds.\\n'I do not accept that the policing operation failed and I standby the difficult decisions made by police officers and the Met's public order commanders.\\n'Without their immediate intervention, it is possible that this game could have been abandoned.'\\nThe senior officer went on to say that she 'shared the nation's anger' at the behaviour witnessed outside the stadium and reiterated her 'commitment to identifying those responsible'.\\nDAC Connors added: 'Throughout the course of the day, police officers witnessed disgraceful behaviour both in central London and at Wembley.\\n'I share the nation's anger at this behaviour. I want to reiterate the Met's commitment to identifying those responsible for the scenes both in Wembley and in central London, their actions will have consequences.'\\nThe officer's comments came as police, security staff and the FA came under fire after thousands of fans were filmed attempting to storm the national stadium ahead of England's Euro 2020 final against Italy.\\nDAC Connors was also the officer in charge when officers were filmed raving with Extinction Rebellion demonstrators at a rave at Oxford Circus in 2019.\\nSpeaking at the time DAC Connors said: 'I'm disappointed by the video and the unacceptable behaviour of the officers in it.\\n'We expect our officers to engage with protestors but clearly their actions fall short of the tone of the policing operation at a time when people are frustrated at the actions of the protestors.\\n'We will be reminding officers of their responsibilities and expectations in policing this operation - however the majority of officers have been working long hours and I am grateful to them for their continued commitment.'\\nEarlier today the PM's spokesman insisted he would 'cooperate fully' if required to be interviewed about allegations of lockdown-breaking gatherings at No10.\\nThe PM\u00a0has denied breaking the law, but the probe has reached a new level, with staff facing questions from police rather than officials.\\nIt had initially appeared Ms Gray's scrutiny would be put on hold in what would have been a respite for Mr Johnson.\\nHowever, following hours of wrangling the Cabinet Office suggested that parts of the report not being looked at by police could soon be released.\\nAnd it has now emerged that the results could be published in full soon, after the Met made clear it had no objection.\\nDespite a mounting Tory revolt, a slew of MPs gave noisy support to the premier in the chamber today, branding the accusations 'vexatious' and asking why Keir Starmer was not under investigation.\\nDuring a hearing at the London Assembly, Dame Cressida pointed out that under guidelines police have not examined historical allegations of lockdown breaches unless there is clear evidence and a lack of a defence.\\n'We have a long-established and effective working relationship with the Cabinet Office, who have an investigative capability,' she said.\\n'As you well know they have been carrying out an investigation over the last few weeks.\\n'What I can tell you this morning is that as a result of the information provided by the Cabinet Office inquiry team and, secondly, my officers' own assessment, I can confirm that the Met is now investigating a number of events that took place at Downing Street and Whitehall in the last two years in relation to potential breaches of Covid-19 regulations.'\\nBoris Johnson celebrated his 56th birthday with a party in the Cabinet Room in Downing Street on June 19, 2020.\\nIt is alleged that as many as 30 people were in attendance.\\nThese are the Covid rules which were in place at the time:\\n\u2013 England was coming out of the first national lockdown, which had been imposed in March.\\n\u2013 Groups of up to six people were able to meet outdoors in England from Monday June 1, including in gardens and other private outdoor spaces, provided strict social distancing guidelines were followed.\\n\u2013 People from different households were told to stay two metres apart and not to spend time inside others' homes other than to get to the garden or use the toilet.\\n\u2013 Indoor gatherings remained against the law, but there were exemptions 'if reasonably necessary' for work purposes.\\nThe Government's original Covid regulations which were put in place in March 2020 gave the police powers to hand out fixed penalty notices for breaches of the rules.\\nInitially, these fines were worth \u00a360 or \u00a330 if paid within 14 days.\\nHowever, the value of the fines increased in England from \u00a360 to \u00a3100 on May 13, 2020, lowering to \u00a350 if paid within two weeks.\\nAdam Wagner, a human rights barrister and Covid rules expert, tweeted today that 'Fixed Penalty Notices are an alternative to prosecution - so generally the police gave FPNs first and if they weren't paid they could proceed to prosecution'.\\nHe added: 'In this case it will almost certainly be FPNs rather than prosecution.'", "image": [["Deputy Assistant Commissioner Jane Connors, the Metropolitan Police's lead for Covid-19, has been put in charge of investigating the alleged lockdown breaches in Downing Street", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/01/25/18/53363467-10440611-image-a-1_1643136137858.jpg"], ["Police officers stand guard as people place flowers and tributes on the floor during a vigil for Sarah Everard in Clapham Common", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/01/25/18/53363563-10440611-image-a-2_1643136213345.jpg"], ["The police force were criticised last year after members of the force were seen using heavy-handed tactics with people at the vigil", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/01/25/18/53363569-10440611-image-a-5_1643136229930.jpg"], ["Police officers at the scene at Wembley Stadium in July last year after thousands tried to storm into the stadium", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/01/26/10/53363605-10440611-Police_officers_at_the_scene_at_Wembley_Stadium_in_July_last_yea-a-1_1643191837169.jpg"], ["Riot police stand guard as hundreds of football fans stand outside the Wembley Stadium during the Euros", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/01/25/18/53363613-10440611-image-a-7_1643136466412.jpg"], ["Officers with demonstrators", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/01/25/18/53363261-10440611-image-a-9_1643136472551.jpg"], ["Officers were filmed dancing", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/01/25/18/53363259-10440611-image-a-10_1643136472598.jpg"]], "author": ["Bhvishya Patel For Mailonline", "Daily Mail Reporter"], "date": "2022-01-25"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10405829/Thousands-Kill-Bill-activists-march-central-London-crowds-streets.html": {"title": "'I just want to go home.

When I got to the top, a good 150ft, the guy who was supposed to do it with me bottled out. I ended up doing it myself.'\\nThe Met's Assistant Commissioner for Professionalism Helen Ball said: 'We recognise the gravity of the judgment in this case, which outlined a series of serious failings that allowed Kennedy to remain deployed on a long-term undercover deployment without the appropriate level of supervision and oversight.\\n'This resulted in Ms Wilson's human rights being breached. In entering into a sexual relationship, Kennedy's actions went against the training and guidelines undercover officers received at the time.\\n'However, the tribunal found that the training was inadequate and more should have been done to consider the risks of male undercover officers forming relationships with women. We accept these findings.'\\nKennedy had sex with up to 11 women during his deployment, including one known as 'Lisa' which lasted for six years before she found a passport in his real name.\\nHe was one of six undercover officers from the NPIOU or its 'sister unit', the Special Demonstration Squad, who Ms Wilson dealt with between 1998 and 2010.\\nMs Wilson brought legal action against the Met and the NPCC for breaches of her right to freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment, her right to privacy and right to freedom of expression.\\nThe Met and NPCC accepted Kennedy's actions amounted to a breach of those rights.\\nBut they had denied other officers - apart from Kennedy and his cover officer - knew or suspected Wilson was in a sexual relationship with Kennedy.\\nIn a ruling last September, the IPT found the Met's claims undercover officers knew sexual relationships were banned were 'materially undermined by the sheer frequency with which (Kennedy) (and other UCOs) did conduct sexual relationships without either questions being asked or action being taken by senior officers'.\\nIt also found the Met and NPCC's failure to guard against the risk of UCOs having sex with women amounted to unlawful discrimination against women.\\nThe tribunal concluded: 'This is not just a case about a renegade police officer who took advantage of his undercover deployment to indulge his sexual proclivities, serious though this aspect of the case unquestionably is.\\n'Our findings that the authorisations under (the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000) were fatally flawed and the undercover operation could not be justified as 'necessary in a democratic society'... reveal disturbing and lamentable failings at the most fundamental levels.'\\nIn a statement issued through the Police Spies Out Of Lives group, Ms Wilson said: 'It is important to note the IPT compensation is not about the relationship I was deceived into by Mark Kennedy.\\n'That was settled in a civil claim back in 2017. It is compensation for the parts of the claim that the police denied right up to the end - how complicit Mark's managers were, and the role of five other undercover officers in violating my political rights, and the fact that they dragged out those denials for 10 years.\\n'The finding that these operations breached the rights to freedom of expression and assembly and were unlawful amounts to a long overdue recognition that spying on protest movement is political policing and has no place in a democratic society.\\n'It is important, because it goes beyond the scandal of undercover officers deceiving women into intimate relationships.\\n'Violating our political rights was the entire reason for these deployments and thousands of people will have had their political rights violated in this way.'\\nThe NPCC said there have been 'significant' changes to undercover policing since the Kennedy affair came to light.\\nChief Constable Alan Pughsley, the NPCC lead for undercover policing, said: 'The training is significantly more rigorous than that during Mark Kennedy's time, both in duration and content.\\n'Cover officers and those supervising and managing operations are now required to complete standardised training courses tailored to their roles.\\n'The psychological fitness and wellbeing of undercover officers is a key consideration during their recruitment, training and deployment.\\n'In addition to the relevant laws, regulations and rules in place, the conduct of undercover officers is governed by a National Code of Conduct and the College of Policing's Code of Ethics.\\n'Significant work has been undertaken to ensure undercover officers and those authorising their deployment understand the legal limits within which they operate, including the core concepts of deployments needing to be necessary and proportionate, and the need to minimise collateral intrusion into the private lives of others.\\n'Oversight of undercover deployments is maintained at a senior level. At least those of Assistant Chief Constable rank or equivalent now authorise deployments, and, for deployments exceeding 12 months, this is conducted by a Chief Constable or equivalent.\\n'The independent Investigatory Powers Commissioner's Office is informed of and scrutinises undercover deployments.\\n'As the tribunal in this case acknowledged, undercover policing remains an effective and vital tactic in the fight against serious organised crime.'\\nHe added: 'Officers in these roles put themselves at great risk every day to protect the public.\\n'Policing will continue to review current policies to ensure tactics are used lawfully and ethically, and all officers uphold the highest professional standards.'", "image": [["Kate Wilson, 41, won her landmark tribunal case against the Met and the National Police Chiefs Council after Mark Stone (pictured together) breached her human rights", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/01/25/12/53349463-10439255-image-a-1_1643114204272.jpg"], ["She started seeing him after meeting in 2003 and had a 'whirlwind romance' for more than a year before they split amicably when she moved to Spain in 2005", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/01/25/12/53348897-10439255-image-a-3_1643114254599.jpg"], ["Pictured: Kennedy", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/01/25/12/53349465-10439255-Pictured_Kennedy-a-18_1643114441887.jpg"], ["The Investigatory Powers Tribunal yesterday ordered the Met and NPCC to pay \u00a3229,471.96 to Ms Wilson over Kennedy's (pictured) actions", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/01/25/12/53349477-10439255-image-a-19_1643114441890.jpg"], ["Ms Wilson (pictured) brought legal action against the Met and the NPCC for breaches of her right to freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment, her right to privacy and right to freedom of expression", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/01/25/12/53349461-10439255-Ms_Wilson_pictured_brought_legal_action_against_the_Met_and_the_-m-21_1643114490283.jpg"]], "author": ["James Gant For Mailonline"], "date": "2022-01-25"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10438687/Minister-refuses-defend-Boriss-June-2020-birthday-party-No10.html": {"title": "Sue Gray 'has new photos of Boris next to wine bottles at lockdown parties': Damning verdict could be revealed TOMORROW after day of shambles saw No10 deny trying to use police partygate probe to delay report", "subtitle": "Civil service inquisitor Sue Gray received pictures of Boris Johnson next to wine bottles, reports Sky News.

Sources tonight suggested that she could now release the full report as soon as Wednesday.\\nThat would force the Prime Minister to come to the Commons this week and could intensify efforts by Tory backbenchers to oust him from office.\\nConservative Andrew Bridgen said he hoped Ms Gray's report into allegations of Downing Street lockdown parties would be published on Wednesday.\\nThe MP for North West Leicestershire told Channel 4 News the conclusions of the civil servant's inquiry should be published 'unredacted'.\\nMr Johnson also faced claims today that he kept news of the police probe from senior ministers when Cabinet met this morning, leaving them to find out from the media when they turned on their mobile phones as they left No10.\\nThe Prime Minister's spokesman said he was aware of 'speculation' that the Met did not object to the publication of the report.\\nHe said: 'The advice that I have had is that there are still ongoing discussions, there are still details that need to be worked through between both the police and the investigations team.\\nThe spokesman said decisions on publication were a matter for the Cabinet Office and police and 'we are not, as in No 10, seeking to block that in any way'.\\nHe added it 'certainly remains the case that we would want it to be published as soon as possible' although 'I would not want to be perceived as putting undue pressure on either the investigations team or the police'.\\nIt added up to yet another day of crisis and drama surrounding Mr Johnson, who faces the prospect of becoming the first PM to be grilled by police as a potential lawbreaker within living memory.\\nAddressing MPs today\u00a0In the Commons, he said he welcomed the police move, saying it could give the public 'clarity' and 'draw a line' under the allegations.\\nIn a brief reference before making a statement on Ukraine, he insisted the government would remain '100 per cent focused on dealing with the people's priorities'.\\nThe PM's spokesman insisted he will 'cooperate fully' if required to be interviewed.\\nIt is not clear whether Mr Johnson was personally involved in any of the the incidents under criminal investigation. The offences carry \u00a3100 fixed penalty fines.\\nBut there is no precedent in modern times for a sitting PM to be subject to a criminal probe, let alone convicted. Tony Blair was interviewed as a witness during the cash-for-honours affair, but not under caution.\\nThe chaos erupted today after it was revealed that a birthday party, complete with cake and singing, was held for Mr Johnson in No10 in June 2020.\\nBoris Johnson celebrated his 56th birthday with a party in the Cabinet Room in Downing Street on June 19, 2020.\\nIt is alleged that as many as 30 people were in attendance.\\nNow the Met has launched a criminal probe into the incident, Number 10 staff face being charged with perjury if they knowingly make a false statement, which carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison.\\nThese are the Covid rules which were in place at the time:\\n\u2013 England was coming out of the first national lockdown, which had been imposed in March.\\n\u2013 Groups of up to six people were able to meet outdoors in England from Monday June 1, including in gardens and other private outdoor spaces, provided strict social distancing guidelines were followed.\\n\u2013 People from different households were told to stay two metres apart and not to spend time inside others' homes other than to get to the garden or use the toilet.\\n\u2013 Indoor gatherings remained against the law, but there were exemptions 'if reasonably necessary' for work purposes.\\nThe Government's original Covid regulations which were put in place in March 2020 gave the police powers to hand out fixed penalty notices for breaches of the rules.\\nInitially, these fines were worth \u00a360 or \u00a330 if paid within 14 days.\\nHowever, the value of the fines increased in England from \u00a360 to \u00a3100 on May 13, 2020, lowering to \u00a350 if paid within two weeks.\\nAdam Wagner, a human rights barrister and Covid rules expert, tweeted today that 'Fixed Penalty Notices are an alternative to prosecution - so generally the police gave FPNs first and if they weren't paid they could proceed to prosecution'.\\nHe added: 'In this case it will almost certainly be FPNs rather than prosecution.'\\nMr Bridgen said: 'I think the sooner the report comes out now the better, if it is completed, because we can't sit under this cloud, paralysing the Prime Minister, paralysing the Government.'\\nReferencing the threat of Russian invasion into Ukraine, he continued: 'These issues that are hanging over our Government at the moment, they need to be dealt with as soon as possible and I do hope that Sue Gray gets her report in tonight and it is published tomorrow.'\\nTold that Conor Burns, a minister and ally of the Prime Minister, had said Boris Johnson had been 'ambushed with a cake' during the latest allegation of a birthday party in June 2020, Mr Bridgen replied: 'You can spin it how you want to.\\n'This isn't about cakes, this isn't about parties, this is about misleading Parliament and whether we can trust the word of the Prime Minister.'\\nThe news broke during Cabinet this morning, and Mr Johnson informed ministers of the development at the end - but there was no discussion, prompting rumours of irritation.\\nDespite a mounting Tory revolt, a slew of MPs gave noisy support to the premier in the chamber, branding the accusations 'vexatious' and asking why Keir Starmer was not under investigation.\\nDuring a hearing at the London Assembly, Dame Cressida pointed out that under guidelines police have not examined historical allegations of lockdown breaches unless there is clear evidence and a lack of a defence.\\n'We have a long-established and effective working relationship with the Cabinet Office, who have an investigative capability,' she said.\\n'As you well know they have been carrying out an investigation over the last few weeks.\\n'What I can tell you this morning is that as a result of the information provided by the Cabinet Office inquiry team and, secondly, my officers' own assessment, I can confirm that the Met is now investigating a number of events that took place at Downing Street and Whitehall in the last two years in relation to potential breaches of Covid-19 regulations.'\\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Jane Connors, the Metropolitan Police's lead for Covid-19 who was previously embroiled in row over policing of the Sarah Everard vigil, has been put in charge of the investigation.\\nA Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: 'The Special Enquiry Team will lead the investigations. DAC Jane Connors will oversee the investigation in her role as the Met's lead officer for Covid.'\\nJacob Rees-Mogg walked out of Cabinet and straight over to cameras to vow loyalty to Mr Johnson.\\n'I am honoured to be under his leadership,' the Commons Leader said.\\nBut former minister David Davis - who last week called for Mr Johnson to quit - said: 'With the police now investigating, this nightmare gets even worse. We have to be able to get back to dealing with real threats as quickly as possible.'\\nTransport Secretary\u00a0Grant Shapps admitted this morning that he was 'upset' by the latest allegations that up to 30 people gathered in the Cabinet Room, presented Mr Johnson with a cake and sang to him.\\nSent out to field questions, Mr Shapps was pushed on why interior designer Lulu Lytle, who had been refurbishing Mr Johnson's flat, had come down three flights of stairs and was present at the alleged party.\\n'You are asking me questions I can't provide the answer to because I wasn't there,' Mr Shapps said.\\nMr Shapps - usually one of the most loyal ministers who has been a key figure trying to quell the revolt up to now - told Sky News: 'It was his (Boris Johnson's) birthday and these are people that he worked with all the time.\\n'As I said, I don't seek to defend it. This is for Sue Gray to decide on whether this was appropriate, she'll make the recommendations.\\nBoris Johnson could make some unwanted history if he is interviewed by the police over Partygate.\\n\\nIt is unprecedented in modern times for a PM to be a suspect in a criminal probe.\\nTony Blair was interviewed as a witness twice during Scotland Yard's cash-for-honours affair in 2006 and 2007.\\nHowever, the questioning was not carried out under caution - meaning that he was classified as a witness.\\nAt the time there was speculation that Mr Blair would have needed to resign if he was treated as a suspect.\\nThe Met's cash-for-honours investigation dragged on for more than a year.\\nBut that probe required far more extensive evidence to be gathered than appears to be the case with Partygate, and the punishments were potentially far more severe.\\nThe minister seemed to lay the blame squarely on Mr Johnson's wife Carrie - sometimes dubbed Carrie Antoinette by critics due to her influence behind the scenes - who is believed to have organised the gathering in the Cabinet Room on June 19, 2020.\\n'Look, as the Prime Minister's said, where mistakes were made, even though it wasn't\u2026 I mean, he would have turned up and the cake would have been there,' he told ITV's Good Morning Britain.\\n'He didn't know about it, and it clearly shouldn't happen.\\n'But Sue Gray will get to the bottom of that; the Prime Minister's already said there will be consequences falling out from the Sue Gray report, and my hope is we can get to see that very quickly.'\\nHe added: 'We know that this was a surprise, the Prime Minister obviously wasn't involved in that surprise, but we need to have a full understanding of all of that.'\\nTory MPs are on high alert for more damaging\u00a0revelations after it emerged that the PM's 56th birthday celebration included a Union Jack cake, Marks and Spencer's nibbles and singing.\\nThe event, first revealed by\u00a0ITV,\u00a0was apparently already on Ms Gray's radar. Earlier that day Mr Johnson had posed with his arms outstretched with children at a school in Hertfordshire to show the importance of social distancing.\\nIn March, Mr Johnson had praised a girl named Josephine who wrote to him saying she was cancelling her seventh birthday while the pandemic was raging.\\nGetting to his feet in the Commons this afternoon, Mr Johnson said:\u00a0'A few weeks ago I commissioned an independent inquiry into a series of events in Downing Street and the Cabinet Office as well as some other Whitehall departments that may have constituted potential breaches of the Covid regulations.\\nThe senior police officer taking charge of the Partygate investigation was previously embroiled in controversy over the Sarah Everard vigil.\\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Jane Connors, the Metropolitan Police's lead for Covid-19, has been put in charge of the probe.\\nA Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: 'The Special Enquiry Team will lead the investigations. DAC Jane Connors will oversee the investigation in her role as the Met's lead officer for Covid.'\\nThe vigil for the murdered marketing executive descended into violent clashes on Clapham Common last year.\\nThe Met was accused of being heavy-handed after refusing permission for the vigil during lockdown, but insisted it 'maintained an appropriate policing plan'.\\n'That process has quite properly involved sharing information continuously with the Metropolitan Police.\\n'So I welcome the Met's decision to conduct its own investigation because I believe this will help to give the public the clarity it needs and help to draw a line under matters.\\n'But I want to reassure the House, Mr Speaker, and the country that I and the whole Government are focused 100 per cent on dealing with the people's priorities, including the UK's leading role in protecting freedom around the world.'\\nDame Cressida\u00a0told London Assembly members that investigations were carried out for 'the most serious and flagrant type of breach' where there was evidence and three criteria were met.\\n'My three factors were and are: there was evidence that those involved knew, or ought to have known that what they were doing was an offence.\\n'Where not investigating would significantly undermine the legitimacy of the law.\\n'And where there was little ambiguity around the absence of any reasonable defence.\\n'So in those cases, where those criteria were met, the guidelines suggested that we should potentially investigate further and end up giving people tickets.'\\nA Cabinet Office spokesman said: 'The investigation being carried out by Sue Gray is continuing.\\n'There is ongoing contact with the Metropolitan Police Service.'\\nDame Cressida said that the police officers on site at Downing Street concentrate on 'protective security'.\\nThe birthday boy: Boris Johnson\\nSources close to the Prime Minister insist he didn't know about the party, which legal experts believe was in breach of his own lockdown rules. Mr Johnson didn't break up the party.\\nDowning Street admitted that the PM attended the event 'for less than ten minutes'. But No 10 denied claims that the bash had been followed by a second party in the PM's flat. Instead, Mr Johnson hosted a small number of people outside, including his sister, where food was cooked on a BBQ.\\n\\nThe organiser: Carrie Johnson\\nA source said members of Johnson's team had been emailed in advance asking them to come to 'wish the prime minister happy birthday'.\\nThe Prime Minister was allegedly given a Union Jack cake by his wife.\u00a0Reports said picnic food from Marks & Spencer was eaten during the afternoon gathering lasting for up to 30 minutes\\nThose present also sang a chorus of happy birthday. Rules at the time banned indoor social gatherings.\\nThe uninvited guest: Rishi Sunak\\nSources close to the Chancellor have insisted that he wasn't invited by Carrie, but was arriving for the Covid meeting in the same room afterwards, attending very briefly. A source stressed he was 'not invited'.\\nThe interior designer: Lulu Lytle\\nInterior designer Lulu Lytle admitted attending while carrying out the lavish and controversial work to their flat above No 11 Downing Street, but insisted she was only present 'briefly' while waiting to talk to Mr Johnson.\\nSome claim she helped carry the cake.\\nParty Marty:\u00a0Martin Reynolds\\nMr Johnson's under-fire principal private secretary, was also said to have attended.

Again, I'm afraid I'm not prepared to comment.\\n'But I can assure you that we are carrying out our investigations and if that is a relevant matter, we will find out about that.'\\nTold that there must by CCTV of the alleged breaches in Downing Street, Dame Cressida said: 'I don't anticipate any difficulty in obtaining the evidence that it is both necessary, proportionate and appropriate for us to obtain in order to get to the right conclusions.'\\nThe Met said it had carried out 'detailed assessments of these outline findings' from the Cabinet Office.\\nThe force is investigating whether regulations were breached 'during events at Downing Street and Whitehall on a number of dates'.\\n'The MPS has written to the Cabinet Office this morning with a formal request for it to refer all relevant information gathered from its inquiry in relation to events on the dates in question to support the police investigations,' the statement said.\\nThe PM's official spokesman said: 'Firstly, the Prime Minister thinks it is entirely right for the police to investigate these matters.\\n'He commissioned the Cabinet Office to establish the facts and, as set out in the published terms of reference, and as the (Met) Commissioner has said this morning, the independent process has always involved the sharing of information with the Met and the ability for the Met to take forward and investigate matters pertaining to the law, as is right.\\n'The PM fully acknowledges the public's anger and concern about what has been reported, he has taken responsibility for his judgments made and it is right the Met should be now given the time and space to undertake their investigations.\\n'It will provide the public with welcome clarity and help draw a line under these events and everyone required will fully co-operate in any way they are asked.'\\nNo10 said Cabinet had not discussed the police investigation, although he mentioned it at the end of the session.\\nThe spokesman said: 'That was confirmed by the police while Cabinet was taking place so he didn't reference it specifically, he alluded to that at the end of Cabinet but beyond that no.\\n'He made those comments about ensuring the Government is not deterred from getting on with the job, he didn't go into detail about the Met given that Cressida Dick made her comments while Cabinet was taking place.'\\nThe spokesman added: 'The Prime Minister was made aware shortly before Cressida Dick announced that in her session.'\\nAsked if Mr Johnson knew about the investigation before Cabinet, the spokesman replied: 'Yes.'\\nMs Gray will pause investigating or publishing any party allegations that the police are inspecting but is free to publish other matters in her inquiry, No 10 has suggested.\\nThe Prime Minister is currently fighting wars on several fronts as he attempts to maintain his premiership.\\nThough Sue Gray's inquiry into 'partygate' is believed to have dug up some extremely damning evidence, here are some of the other challenges facing Downing Street which could prove deadly to Boris' leadership.\\nAllegations of Islamophobia\\nNusrat Ghani, the first Muslim woman to be elected as a Tory MP in 2015, said she was told by a party whip she was being axed in Feb 2020 because her status as a Muslim woman was 'making colleagues feel uncomfortable'.\\nShe also claimed she was told by the whip that she had been fired for saying to Boris Johnson that they had a 'women problem', in attracting female voters.\\nMs\u00a0Ghani claimed she raised the issue through official party channels but said she was warned that if she continued to do so, she would be 'ostracised' by her colleagues and her 'career and reputation would be destroyed'.\\nWilliam Wragg's allegations of MP blackmail\\nWilliam Wragg, a backbencher who accused Downing Street of trying to blackmail rebel MPs, said yesterday he would meet police to discuss his allegations.\\nDowning Street said it had not seen any proof of the behaviour he alleges, but Chris Bryant, chairman of the Commons Committee on Standards, said about a dozen Tory MPs alleged whips threatened to withdraw funding for their constituencies should they not show support for Johnson.\\nWhips have also been accused of heavy-handed attempts to intimidate the rebels with the threat of revealing allegations about their sex lives.\\n1922 Committee\\nWilliam Wragg and Nusrat Ghani are joint vice-chairmen of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers.\\nThe committee's executive secretary Gary Sambrook has also expressed his desire for a new Tory leader, while treasurer Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown voiced frustration with the PM last year.\\nIf Johnson were to win a party confidence vote, he would be immune to another leadership challenge for a year - but the committee is considering cutting this immunity period to six months.\\nDefectors\\nFormer Tory MP Christian Wakeford crossed the floor and joined the Labour party last week.\\nThough defections are rare in Parliament, there are rumours that more Tory MPs may soon follow suit.\\nThe PM's spokesman said: 'As the terms of reference make clear, they won't publish anything that relates to the work of the police, there are a number of events and allegations that they have looked into that the police said don't reach their threshold, which they are able to continue looking into.\\n'And it is my understanding that they will be able to publish detail about those events rather than ones which the police might be taking forward.'\\nHe added: 'It's up to the investigation team when they publish, it's my understanding they are able to publish the aspects that aren't a matter for the police.'\\nDiscussing the events the police are investigating, the spokesman said: 'I think under the terms of reference that work (for the Gray inquiry) pauses, I don't know what that means once the Met Police's investigation concludes, whether they return to them and continue.'\\nThe terms of reference for the Gray inquiry state: 'As with all internal investigations, if during the course of the work any evidence emerges of behaviour that is potentially a criminal offence, the matter will be referred to the police and the Cabinet Office's work may be paused.'\\nDowning Street said this afternoon that 'there are discussions still ongoing between the investigations team and the police' on what can be published.\\n'I am not privy to those discussions, as I think you'll appreciate,' the spokesman said.\\n'That still needs to be worked through, both in relation to what may or may not be published and the ongoing work of both the police and the (Gray) investigation.'\\nTory MP Edward Leigh dismissed the idea that the government was trying to delay the report to lessen the damage, saying Ms Gray would not allow that.\\n'I assure you that she would not be bullied by anyone,' Sir Edward said.\\nBut Lib Dem leader Ed Davey told Sky News that Ms Gray should go ahead.\\n'It can be published in full,' he said. That would be the right thing to do.'\\nChancellor Rishi Sunak is thought to have attended the birthday bash for Mr Johnson in June 2020 for a short period of time, but sources insisted that he 'had not been invited'.\\nITV News said that picnic food from M&S was eaten during the afternoon gathering, lasting for up to 30 minutes. Martin Reynolds, Mr Johnson's under-fire principal private secretary, was also said to have attended.\\nOther guests are reported to have included\u00a0Jack Doyle, the director of communications, and Shelley Williams-Walker, his head of operations.\\nA spokesman told ITV that the afternoon event was a surprise and he stayed for only 10 minutes. The broadcaster\u00a0also claimed that there was a separate event later on in the PM's flat.\\nA spokeswoman for Ms Lytle said: 'Lulu was not invited to any birthday celebrations for the prime minister as a guest.

Conservative MPs should stop propping him up and he should finally do the decent thing and resign.'\\nBut at an urgent question in the Commons, Tories staged a show of support for the PM.\\nStuart Anderson, MP for Wolverhampton South West, highlighted the Russian military build-up on the Ukrainian border, adding: 'Every time the Opposition call for our Prime Minister to resign, does my right honourable friend agree that we're only strengthening Putin's hand and destabilising negotiations?'\\nBy Rory Tingle, Home Affairs Correspondent for MailOnline\\nCressida Dick's decision to announce an investigation into the Partygate scandal risks further inflaming tensions between the Met commissioner and senior Conservatives that have been raging for years.\\nDame Cressida has reportedly drawn the ire of Tory ministers, including Home Secretary Priti Patel, in the wake of a string of scandals that have dogged her career both before and after she rose to the top job.\\nThese have been both frequent and wide-ranging, from the Met's handling of environmental protests and Covid street parties to her role in disasters like Operation Midland and the official reaction to Sarah Everard's murder.\\nThe shocking revelation that the 33-year-old student had been murdered by serving Met officer Wayne Couzens, 48, in March 2021, saw senior Tories mount their most intense and public criticism of Dame Cressida to date.\\nIain Duncan-Smith was among those calling for her to step down, with the former party leader saying the time had come for new 'leadership and focus' at the Met.\\nThe tragedy also renewed long-standing tensions with Home Secretary Priti Patel, who declared she was 'upset' by footage of police breaking up a vigil for Miss Everard on Clapham Common a week after she was found dead.\\nShe ordered a 'full report' into what happened, which eventually cleared the force of wrongdoing.\\nFollowing Couzens' conviction, Miss Patel was said to be furious at the Met's advice urging women who suspected they were about to be abducted by a police officer to call 999 or flag down a bus.\\nAccording to The Times, she was also irritated at Dame Cressida's decision to announce a review of the Met's standards and culture when she had been told by Miss Patel that she would use her speech at the Tory conference the next day to announce an independent inquiry.\\nOperation Midland - the Met's disastrous investigation into fake claims of a Satan-worshipping paedophile ring in Westminster that wrongly implicated several senior Tory politicians - has also prompted a raft of uncomfortable headlines.\\nIn February, it emerged Dame Cressida had been responsible for supervising the senior investigating officer who said the claims by former star witness Carl Beech \u2013 which were subsequently shown to be false \u2013 were 'credible and true'.\\nFollowing a highly critical letter by former judge Sir Richard Henriques published in the Daily Mail, Miss Patel initially failed to express her confidence in Dame Cressida during a live interview, although her spokesman later insisted the Met chief enjoyed her 'full confidence'.\\nAnother source of recurring tension between the Met and senior Tories has been the force's handling of disruptive protests by green campaigners.\\nThe Met was widely criticised for its 'light-touch' policing of Extinction Rebellion protests, with anger increasing further when Extinction Rebellion activists began blocking motorways last year.\\nIn September, footage emerged of a Met Police officer allowing protesters to walk in front of cars, a frustrated Miss Patel urged forces to take 'decisive action' to stop further blockades.\\nA government source went further, telling the Telegraph: 'The British public does not expect the police to be standing by while protesters disrupt people's daily lives.' The Met defended the response as a necessary move to stop the activists injuring themselves.\\nJune 2020 saw another instance of Miss Patel publicly piling pressure on Dame Cressida, after disturbing footage showed officers being overpowered and forced to flee a 'mini riot' after a block party in Brixton.\\nThe Home Secretary announced she would demand a 'full explanation' from the Met commissioner after 22 officers were injured in the violence, while Tory MP Andrew Bridgen accused her of 'losing control of the streets'.\\nDespite Dame Cressida's repeated scandals, Miss Patel agreed to renew her contract when it came up for renewal in September 2021, saying the move would 'ensure continuity' during the pandemic.\\nOne senior Tory MP said Scotland Yard desperately needed a new commissioner, but the alternatives to Dame Cressida were far too 'woke'. 'She has presided over some humdingers, not just as commissioner but in her career,' the MP said. 'The time is right to get a new commissioner. But we don't want to replace her with ''commander woke''.'\\nCabinet Office minister Michael Ellis replied: 'He is quite right to focus on what matters around the world and indeed to the Prime Minister of this country.'\\nAnother backbencher, David Morris, complained 'there is no difference' between the events that took place in Downing Street and the 'activities' of Sir Keir - in an apparent reference to photographs the Labour leader drinking beer in an office during lockdown.\\nThe MP for Morecambe and Lunesdale said: 'Would the paymaster general consider the Metropolitan Police or any other police force looking into the activities of the leader of the Opposition with his beers party? As far as I can see, there is no difference.'\\nMr Ellis replied: 'My honourable friend makes an interesting point. But of course, police investigations and how they conduct themselves are operationally independent. I'm sure they will have heard what he said.'\\nMr Rees-Mogg strode straight over to reporters outside No10 after Cabinet broke up.\\n'The leadership of Boris Johnson this country has had has been so brilliant \u2013 that he has got us through this incredibly difficult period and he's got all the big decisions right,' he said.\\n'We have opened up faster than any other European country thanks to the Prime Minister, and I'm honoured to be under his leadership.'\\nSome ministers and Tory MPs tried to shrug the latest furore off overnight - pointing out that the growing chaos in Ukraine could quickly overshadow the controversy - but others warned that it could herald a new more dangerous phase for Mr Johnson.\\nOne senior MP told MailOnline that the premier was facing huge damage that would not end. 'It just keeps piling on,' they said.\\nA Tory who so far has not submitted a no confidence letter added that the gathering on June 19 was 'clearly social' and 'changes things \u2013 a lot'.\\nA frontbencher also referred to the mounting possibility of the PM losing a no confidence vote, saying if a third of the payroll voted against the PM then he needs 'at least half of all backbenchers to back him', adding: 'That seems pretty unlikely. You can see things get dangerous quickly.'\\nAs allies desperately mobilise an 'Avengers' operation to save the PM, 70 Tories including five Cabinet ministers held an online meeting to discuss his situation yesterday.\\nHousing minister Chris Pincher, a former whip, is said to have warned the group that an election could follow within months if Mr Johnson is ousted.\\nWhitehall's standards chief today delivered a thinly-veiled warning to Boris Johnson as he said there can be a 'significant political price to pay' for failing to maintain high ethical standards in public life.\\nLord Evans, the chairman of the\u00a0independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, told MPs that voters 'undoubtedly' care about the issue after a series of Westminster scandals.\\nHe said that while 'there has never been a golden age of standards' the events of the last few months have caused 'a lot of public concern about standards issues'.\\nHe said it is 'very clear' that politicians can pay the price 'if the public don't believe that their representatives or those who are being paid from the public purse are acting in the best interests of the public'.\\nBefore the police announcement, Tory MP Tobias Ellwood condemned the 'latest twist in which has been quite a horrible series of events', telling Nigel Farage's show on GB News: 'Very sad to read these latest headlines.\\n'The nation is rightly very angry by what's happened. We're almost in a holding pattern as we wait for Sue Gray's report.\\n'I'm curious as to whether this was allowed to leak out in the build up to that report or whether she's going to have to require an extension indeed to include the study of this latest event. This is all a massive distraction from where we should be focusing.\\n'There are both domestic issues, huge challenges nationally, but also internationally that require attention. So it's very sad to see this latest twist in which has been quite horrible series of events rolling out for the last three or four months.'\\nMonths before the party, Mr Johnson had praised a schoolgirl who cancelled her birthday celebration because of the lockdown.\\nHe tweeted: 'Josephine sets a great example to us all by postponing her birthday party until we have sent coronavirus packing.'\\nCulture Secretary Nadine Dorries attempted to defend the PM, tweeting: 'So, when people in an office buy a cake in the middle of the afternoon for someone else they are working in the office with and stop for 10 minutes to sing happy birthday and then go back to their desks, this is now called a party?'\\nShe also attacked former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson. Ms Davidson had said her partner 'shares a birthday with the Prime Minister' but did not think to break any rules in 2020.\\nBut Ms Dorries responded: 'Ruth, you were at home with your partner.\\n'The PM was working in Downing St with 100s of staff in Covid war room offices. Where/what is the comparison?'\\nAnd Environment Secretary George Eustice described the latest allegations as not 'serious', saying 'at the end of the day a small group of staff brought in a birthday cake'.\\nHe told Sky News: 'My understanding is the prime minister had a small number of family, close family members, with him outdoors in the garden to celebrate his birthday.'\\nMr Eustice continued: 'I do think that in this saga there have been some quite serious allegations made - those have been investigated.\\n'I don't think that these latest allegations that have been made fit into that category. I think they have gone slightly over the top.'\\nA No 10 spokeswoman said:\u00a0'A group of staff working in No 10 that day gathered briefly in the Cabinet Room after a meeting to wish the Prime Minister a happy birthday. He was there for less than 10 minutes.'\\nRegarding allegations of a later event in the No11 flat she added: 'This is totally untrue. In line with the rules at the time the Prime Minister hosted a small number of family members outside that evening.'\\nA spokesman for Lulu Lytle confirmed she was in Downing Street, saying: 'Lulu was present in Downing Street on 19 June working on the refurbishment.\\n'Lulu was not invited to any birthday celebrations for the prime minister as a guest. Lulu entered the Cabinet Room briefly as requested, while waiting to speak with the Prime Minister.'\\nBaroness Warsi told Channel 4 News: 'During lockdown when so many of us could not go on to do the things that we wanted to do with our families, including birthdays - I had a 50th in the middle of Covid and we had a Zoom Party, my husband had his 50th and we spoke to our children over the telephone\u2026 those of us in public life were making decision that erred on the side of caution because we were people who were involved in making sure that legislation for Covid went through both houses.\\n'Therefore it was right that we interpreted that in the strictest way possible because we needed to be seen to be following the rules that we were making.\\n'Anybody who was at a party where rules were broken, whether that's a Prime Minister, ministers, special advisers, or civil servants, [they] should resign. If you are in a place which makes the rules and you are seen not to be following those rules then you should fall on your sword, you should say 'I got this wrong' and therefore, the way to deal with it is through a resignation.\\n'And therefore, that's not just talking about the Prime Minister, that's talking about anybody who was present when those rules were broken.'\\nThe latest claims of alleged rule-breaking at Downing Street was described as 'completely sickening' by a group representing those bereaved in the pandemic.\\nJo Goodman, co-founder of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said 'Like thousands of others, I remember June 19th vividly.\\n'It was the day before what would have been my dad's 73rd birthday, shortly after he had passed away from Covid-19. It was a horrible time for my family, but we stuck to the rules, not even being able to hug to comfort each other.\\n'It's completely sickening that the Prime Minister spent the evening sharing cake with 30 friends indoors and though we're not even surprised any more, it still brings fresh pain. Whilst dozens sang happy birthday to him, families couldn't even sing in memory at their loved ones funerals.\\n'Regardless of any report, the Prime Minister clearly needs to resign. He's lost all credibility.\\n'Every day and every fresh scandal pours salt on the wounds of the hundreds of thousands who have lost loved ones. If he had any decency he would do what we and the country is calling for him to do and go.'\\nLabour (Co-op) MP for Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport Luke Pollard tweeted two pictures of his 'lockdown birthday' in 2020, questioning the Prime Minister.\\nOne picture shows a card which read 'April 2020 - Definitely the most s**t birthday you have ever had'.\\n'For my lockdown birthday in 2020 I had a wonderful day with my lovely boyfriend at home,' he tweeted.\\n'No parties. No rules broken. If I could do it, why couldn't the Prime Minister?'\\nScottish National Party MP John Nicolson recalled his late mother's final birthday, celebrated over FaceTime, after an allegation of a birthday party in Downing Street for Boris Johnson.\\nThe MP for Ochil and South Perthshire, tweeted: 'In June of 2020 my mum died shortly after her birthday which we 'celebrated' over FaceTime.\\n'I hadn't been able to see her for many weeks. She was very lonely. But we agreed we should follow the rules.\\n'I can't express how much I despise this cruel charlatan and his acolytes.'\\nCabinet split over new Partygate crisis? Boris Johnson loyalists like Nadine Dorries, Jacob Rees-Mogg and George Eustice DEFEND PM amid birthday bash anger but Grant Shapps is 'upset' and senior ministers like Rishi are conspicuous by their silence\\nBoris Johnson loyalist mounted a desperate rearguard action around the beleaguered Prime minister as he faced yet more damning Partygate claims.\\nSenior Cabinet ministers including Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries downplayed the seriousness of the PM attending the bash with cake and nibbles in a No10 stateroom in 2020.\\nThey insisted that the gathering of around 30 people specifically to mark the PM's\u00a0 56th birthday in June 2020 could be seen as a extension of the workplace.\\nMs Dorries also took to Twitter today to lash out at senior Tories including former Scottish party leader Ruth Davidson, who criticised the Prime minister in the wake of the ITV News' revelations.\\nBut other normally loyal ministers like Transport Secretary Grant Shapps were tepid in their backing for the PM this morning.\\nOn a morning media round he admitted he was 'upset' by the latest allegations.\\nAnd other ministers said to have an eye on replacing Mr Johnson have yet to comment.\\nChancellor Rishi Sunak was understood to have briefly attended as the gathering was breaking up as he entered the room to attend a Covid strategy meeting.\\nThe Loyalists:\\nNadine Dorries - Culture Secretary\\nMs Dorries was one of the first out of the blocks to defend the PM last night after the allegations emerged.

Nine days ago, four other protesters were cleared over Edward Colston statue toppling in Bristol.", "text": "MPs today blasted an 'outrageous' decision by a jury to unanimously clear three Extinction Rebellion activists of obstructing the railway - after a judge cited their right to protest under the European Convention of Human Rights.\\nThe group claimed their actions were justified by their Christian faith and fears for their grandchildren, but angry politicians said the verdict set a 'dangerous precedent' and gave a 'green light' for people to commit crime.\\nFormer university lecturer Philip Kingston, 85, Anglican priest Reverend Sue Parfitt, 79, and Father Martin Newell, 54, all climbed on top of the Docklands Light Railway train during the morning rush-hour in London.\\nXR has said that the so-called 'Shadwell 3' case was one of a series of trials involving its activists this year in front of a jury - which will prompt fears over whether the other cases are also likely to result in protesters being freed.\\nThe protesters, who are members of Christian Climate Action within environmental group XR, caused chaos on October 17, 2019 at Shadwell station in East London.\\nDespite their stunt delaying rush-hour commuters for 77 minutes, the trio denied the charges. In their defence, Parfitt said she had felt 'deeply called by God to do all that I can to avert the catastrophe that is on its way to his whole creation', while Newell said he had been asking God while on top of the train to 'forgive us for what we've done'.\\nThe activists also said in their defence that there were a further ten XR protesters on the platform at Shadwell to ensure violence did not break out, and MailOnline has asked the group to clarify whether any of these ten faced criminal proceedings.\\nJudge Reid had told the jury that protest rights under the European Convention of Human Rights 'gives them and us the freedom of belief, expression and the right to freedom of assembly', adding: 'Are we sure that a conviction of the defendant for obstructing the railway is necessary in a democratic society in the interest of public safety, prevention of disorder or protection of rights and freedoms of others?'\\nReacting to today's verdict, Conservative MP Brendan Clarke-Smith told MailOnline this afternoon: 'The selfish actions and egos of these individuals prevented people from getting to work to provide for their families, children from attending school, wasted the time of our emergency services and put people's lives at risk.\\n'I don't see that as being a particularly Christian thing to do.\u00a0Whilst I would always defend the jury system, it clearly needs a review, and this outrageous decision has given the green light to people looking to commit all manner of appalling crimes in the name of religion to justify their extreme political ideologies.'\\nHis fellow Tory MP Tom Hunt also told MailOnline today: 'I think what we are seeing is a dangerous precedent. Unfortunately, I suspected that the disappointing Colston statue verdict might be a green light for other criminal acts, and that is what we are starting to see.\\n'It is clear to me that those committing vandalism and damaging public property, or blocking public access like roads or railways, should be punished. I am disappointed to see another instance where this has not been the case, and concerned about the precedent this continues to set.'\\nToday's verdict will fuel concerns that police could stop arresting protesters or the Crown Prosecution Service could stop charging them with crimes if there is a general expectation that they will be freed - and that all those who do end up in court will demand a jury trial because they have a greater chance of being let off.\\nKingston, Parfitt and Newell were charged with obstructing an engine or carriage on the railway, but were cleared by a jury at Inner London Crown Court this morning.\\nIf the DLR protesters had been found guilty at a magistrates' court under section 36 of the Malicious Damage Act 1861, they would have faced up to six months in prison.\\nThis would have increased to two years imprisonment' if they were convicted at a crown court. The trio would have also each faced an unlimited fine at either court.\\nThe DLR train which was travelling from Lewisham to Bank was about 70 per cent full of passengers - and the court heard the protest caused 77 minutes of disruption.\\n\\nKingston superglued his hand to the DLR train while Reverend Parfitt and Father Newell climbed on the roof and said prayers for the planet shortly before 7am.\\nThe trio said they were strongly motivated by their Christian faith, while Kingston said the futures of his four grandchildren also prompted him to take part.\\nSilas James Reid, the judge in today's Extinction Rebellion case, was sworn in as a Circuit Judge on the South Eastern Circuit - where he has based at Inner London Crown Court since July 2018.\\nJudge Reid also presided over another Extinction Rebellion case in December 2019 involving three protesters who glued themselves to a Docklands Light Railway train at Canary Wharf.\\nThose three were found guilty of obstructing an engine or a carriage at Inner London Crown Court \u2013 the same charge as the Shadwell protesters today, also in front of the same court and the same judge.\\nIn addition, the foreman of the jury in the Canary Wharf case \u2013 which was the first XR trial to be dealt with by a crown court as opposed to a magistrates' court - said he was finding them guilty 'with regret'.\\nThe judge is officially known as His Honour Judge Reid and was called to the Bar in 1995, before being appointed as a Recorder in 2012.\\nSpeaking outside court today, Newell said he was 'delighted' with the verdict but he will continue to take further action and is prepared to go to jail.\\nHe added: 'I'm very grateful to the jury to acting on their conscience and hearing the issues that we wanted to raise in the original action two-and-a-half years ago.\\n'The climate emergency is the biggest issue facing the human race in our time and nothing is more important with dealing with that and despite the words that many governments have said about being more urgent, they're just not doing it.'\\nWhen asked whether he was planning to disrupt public transport again, he said: 'I'm not sure that disrupting public transport is the right thing to do at this point, but in terms of would I risk going to prison? Absolutely.'\\nAlso outside court today, Parfitt said she felt her action has been 'vindicated' and hopes it will 'inspire others' to make 'sacrifices' for the climate.\\nShe said: 'It's wonderful that the jury saw the bigger picture, that the court has vindicated our action and we hope it in some small way inspires others to feel that there may be sacrifices to be made, perhaps particularly by people of faith.\\n'We have to do whatever it takes to try our best to enable the people on this earth to change direction radically so that we live differently and we live in a better way.\\n'We are in an extreme and dire emergency in terms of our civilisation and our human and non-human species on the planet, and we have to have action from the Governments of the world.\\n'We only have power to influence this Government, our Government, and we must go on doing that in every way we can in order to get action, not words, to at least possibly slow down what is coming down for us.'\\nIn what they said was an attempt to appeal to the public and the Government about the dangers of climate change and the financial institutions whose actions damage the planet, they targeted a train which was one stop away from Bank, in the City of London's financial district.\\nSome 15 trains were delayed or cancelled but none were stuck in tunnels.\\nThis was partly because, according to the activists, they had planned the demonstration to ensure there was no risk to public safety, by taking measures including targeting a station above ground and having ten more Extinction Rebellion activists on the platform to ensure violence did not break out.\\nCOLSTON STATUE\\nToday's verdict on the Docklands Light Railway protest comes after four people were cleared of criminal damage over toppling the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol and throwing it in the harbour.\\nThe bronze memorial to the 17th century figure was pulled down during a Black Lives Matter protest in the city on June 7, 2020, and those responsible were acquitted on January 5 following an 11-day trial at Bristol Crown Court.\\nDLR AT CANARY WHARF\\nAnd last month six XR activists were cleared by a jury of halting the DLR by mounting a protest at Canary Wharf station on April 25, 2019.\\nSHELL HQ DAMAGE\\nIn April last year, six Extinction Rebellion protesters were cleared of causing criminal damage to Shell's London headquarters despite the judge directing jurors at Southwark Crown Court that they had no defence in law.\\nARMS FAIR CONVICTIONS\\nLast year saw a string of convictions overturned at the Old Bailey, where a judge urged the Crown Prosecution Service to review its response to protesters' appeals against convictions for obstructing a highway in light of a Supreme Court ruling in June.\\nJudge Mark Dennis QC said in August there was a 'fundamental problem', adding the Crown had not 'grasped' the effect of the ruling or the 'basic human rights point that has been there for a very long time'.\\nThe Supreme Court had overturned the convictions of four protesters, Christopher Cole, Henrietta Cullinan, Joanna Frew and Nora Ziegler, who were charged with obstruction of the highway after they locked themselves together outside an arms fair in 2017.\\nIn their judgment, Lord Hamblen and Lord Stephens said: 'There should be a certain degree of tolerance to disruption to ordinary life, including disruption of traffic, caused by the exercise of the right to freedom of expression or freedom of peaceful assembly.'\\n\\nFORMER ATHLETE'S SENTENCE CUT\\nAnd former Paralympic athlete James Brown, who was given a 12-month jail term after supergluing himself to the roof of a British Airways plane at London City Airport in a bid to draw attention to the climate crisis, had his sentence cut to four months by appeal judges.\\nDEPORTATION FLIGHT\\nIn January last year, a group of activists who stopped a deportation flight to Africa from leaving Stansted Airport in March 2017 had their convictions overturned by the Court of Appeal.\\nINSULATE BRITAIN OUT OF JAIL\\n\\nEarlier today, several activists who blocked motorways as part a series of protests by the Extinction Rebellion offshoot Insulate Britain were released from prison.\\nKingston, Parfitt and Newell all pleaded not guilty to the charge.\\nReacting to the verdict, Mike Schwarz, solicitor at Hodge Jones and Allen, said: 'There is mounting evidence from the courts and in particular from juries that the public is taking the climate crisis and the increasingly urgent need to focus on it far more seriously than government and business.\\n'This verdict is part of this escalating pattern.'\\nThe verdict comes after four people were cleared of criminal damage over toppling the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol and throwing it in the harbour.\\nThe bronze memorial to the 17th century figure was pulled down during a Black Lives Matter protest in Bristol on June 7, 2020, and those responsible were acquitted on January 5 following an 11-day trial at Bristol Crown Court.\\nAnd in April last year, six Extinction Rebellion protesters were cleared of causing criminal damage to Shell's London headquarters despite the judge directing jurors they had no defence in law.\\nAt Shadwell, Newell and Parfitt climbed a retractable ladder and sat on top of the carriage while Kingston superglued his hand to the side of the carriage in their protest against climate change.\\nVideo clips from the scene showed angry commuters and passengers swearing at the Extinction Rebellion protestors while one yelled: 'This is a f***ing electric train, you should be supporting this.'\\nNewell and Parfitt insisted they were motivated by faith and compelled to act in the way they did due to the climate emergency.\\nParfitt said: 'I feel deeply called by God to do all that I can to avert the catastrophe that is on its way to his whole creation.'\\nThe duo, along with Kingston who attended trial via video-link from his home in Bristol due to his age, were cleared by the jury after around two hours of deliberation.\\nParfitt and Newell had been accompanied at court by a number of supporters during the whole trial who could said the verdict was 'amazing' outside of the courtroom.\\nJudge Silas Reid had said that protest rights under the European Convention of Human Rights 'gives them and us the freedom of belief, expression and the right to freedom of assembly.'\\nHe explained however that 'those rights are not without exception.\\n'Are we sure that a conviction of the defendant for obstructing the railway is necessary in a democratic society in the interest of public safety, prevention of disorder or protection of rights and freedoms of others?'\\nGiving evidence Parfitt said: 'Essentially because there is a climate emergency which is an existential threat to the human race and because this was the best way that I could think of, at that moment, at that time, to draw attention to it and get the government to take action.\\n'We've tried everything else - that wasn't working, and unfortunately disruption seems to be the best way to get people's attention and the government's attention.\\n'The symbolic power of that action, of people seeing that - why would someone do that why would someone climb on top of a train, stop a train - people will think well, it must be really serious for people to do this.'\\nNewell told the court that inherent to his decision to take part in the protest was his Christian faith. He has been ordained as a priest for 25 years.\\nA former Paralympic athlete given a 12-month jail term after supergluing himself to the roof of a British Airways plane at London City Airport in a bid to draw attention to the climate crisis today had his sentence cut to four months by appeal judges.\\nExtinction Rebellion activist James Brown, of Exeter, Devon, was jailed by a judge at Southwark Crown Court in September after being convicted of causing a public nuisance.\\nLawyers representing Brown, who has been registered blind since birth, challenged his conviction and sentence at a Court of Appeal hearing in London in December.\\nThree appeal judges, Lord Burnett, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Goss, ruled today that the 12-month jail term should be cut to four months. They dismissed his appeal against conviction.\\nThe three judges had said at the appeal hearing that Brown, who is in his late 50s, could be released on bail, pending the delivery of their ruling.\\nThey imposed a bail condition which barred him from entering any airport where commercial flights operate.\\nLawyers representing Brown said there had been no reason to charge him with causing a public nuisance, questioned the proportionality of the decision to bring the charge, and said he could have been charged with aggravated trespass.\\nThey also told appeal judges that custody was not justified on the facts of the case. Lawyers argued that the 12-month term was 'manifestly disproportionate' and said Brown suffered 'unique hardship' in prison because of his disability.\\nIn a written ruling, Lord Burnett said people who caused major disruption at airports and were convicted of causing a public nuisance ran 'a substantial risk' of going to prison.\\nBut he said appeal judges had considered whether a 12-month jail term was 'manifestly excessive' in the light of Brown's conduct, antecedents and disability.\\nHe added: 'Taking account of all the circumstances, we have concluded that the sentence should be one of four months' imprisonment.'\\nLord Burnett said the judges' 'starting point' took into account the 'impact' of Brown's conduct, as well as the 'broader intention to cause wider disruption and the need for deterrence'.\\nHe added: 'The right to peaceful protest should not lead to tolerance of behaviour that is far removed from conveying a strongly held conviction but instead seeks to cause chaos and as much harm as possible to members of the public.'\\nLord Burnett said judges concluded that Brown's conviction was not 'unsafe'.\\nJurors heard he had printed out copies of a prayer 'Litany of the earth' parts of which he had adapted from other prayers and parts he had written himself.\\n'It's a long prayer - I wrote most of it myself and a part of it is obviously about concern for the environment and concern for our part in what we are doing to the earth - God's earth and asking God to forgive us for what we've done and ask God to change what we need to.'\\nSitting on top of the train, the pair recited the prayer, alternating turns.\\nIn the midst of the action, a fellow commuter climbed the ladder and threw the paper copies onto the platform.\\nNewell said: 'The most important commandment for a Christian is to love God and to love our neighbour. Pope Francis says the earth is our neighbour.\\n'All of us we depend on the earth for our life, so if the earth is suffering we suffer too.'\\nParfitt, who is just weeks away from her 80th birthday told the jury: 'I did it because I feel deeply called by God to do all that I can to avert the catastrophe that is on its way to his whole creation.\\n'The older I get the more compelled I feel to do this.\\n'In this particular case I believe that there is a compelling case for there to be acts of civil disobedience to try to wake up the government and society to the extreme emergency that we are in.\\n'I'm sure that you must feel, members of the jury and others in the court, that this was an outrageous action to take.\\n'And it was and I took it because of the outrageous inaction of the government and other governments in the world.\\nShe asked the jury to acknowledge previous social movements, including the Suffragettes, since 'all the great social movements that have brought about change in society have needed to include an element of civil disobedience.'\\nParfitt had travelled from Bristol to London to attend previous Extinction Rebellion protests during October 2019.\\n'I got a message through Christian Climate Action to say that there was a proposal to do an action towards the end of the protests that would involve civil disobedience and would I be interested.\\n'I was invited to a meeting 2 days before, on October 15th, it was at that meeting I learned it was going to be to do with train transport in some way so that sounded okay to me.\\n'I knew nothing about anything really - I'm never involved in planning things - I see myself as rather a small cog in the wheel.\\n'I was completely satisfied [with regards to safety] in the sense that I knew the people who were taking charge of this.'\\nThe group of between 10 and 12 people travelled by DLR to West Ferry station and then to Shadwell.\\n'We were on the train for either one or two st\\nOfficers had assisted Parfitt down the ladder using ropes and safety equipment but she insisted that had there been a medical emergency she would have been able to get down the ladder herself.\\nParfitt added: 'I have to say and I can look at you members of the jury and I can see that you're much younger than me and it may be that you have children, I don't have children myself and therefore I don't have grandchildren.\\n'What I do I'm doing for other people's children. I'm sorry to be so blunt about it but those grandchildren have no future whatsoever unless we can slow this down.'\\nYesterday, Kingston told Inner London Crown Court that his grandchildren are 'the greatest concern' in his life and that his Catholic faith also influenced his decision to take part in the demonstration.\\n\\nMembers of Insulate Britain called on the police to stop arresting them and vowed to continue their campaign as they were freed from prison today.\\nEmma Smart, an ecologist, was released from HMP Bronzefield in Surrey shortly after 9.40am on Friday after being sentenced to four months in prison in November.\\nThe ecologist was one of six people released on Friday after they were jailed for breaching a Government injunction which prevented them from protesting on major roads in the UK.\\nDr Diana Warner, a retired GP, was also released from the same prison.\\nPeople cheered and clapped after they exited the site, with Smart punching the air. They were then hugged by friends and supporters.\\nSmart, who\u00a0undertook a 26-day hunger strike while in the prison,\u00a0said it 'made her focus' on her campaigning efforts for the group.\\nFour other members of Insulate Britain - James Thomas, an architect, Oliver Rock, a carpenter, Roman Paluch, a warehouse operator, and Tim Speers, a volunteer, were released from HMP Thameside, in south-east London.\\nSpeaking to the media after leaving, Smart said: 'This is amazing. This is a beautiful day. It is lovely to have the sun on me - I've not had it on me for a few weeks.'\\nThe group are among 10 people who were jailed last year for breaking the Government's M25 injunction - with three other members since being released.\\nA final member of Insulate Britain, Ben Taylor, a community volunteer, remains in prison after being handed a six-month sentence.\\nDuring her time in prison, Smart undertook a 26-day hunger strike while in prison and was moved to the hospital wing 13 days into her strike.\\nShe said she decided to do it while incarcerated as she was 'absolutely appalled' by the sentence they were given.\\nShe added: 'When I was sat in the van being taken from court to the prison, I just remember thinking about the injustice of it all and the words of the judge - that we had caused harm to the public and harm to the economy. I was absolutely outraged.\\n'We were trying to prevent harm - 8,500 people dying every single year because they can't afford to heat their homes and eat. That's appalling, that's harm.\\n'(The hunger strike) was a tiny insight into these parents who go without eating so they can feed their children. It really strengthened my resolve. I hadn't done it before, I didn't know how it would go, it wasn't easy, but it really made me focus on why I'm doing this.'\\nAsked if she would take to the roads again, she said: 'As long as our Government is continuing to fail and betray our people in both a climate crisis, a fuel crisis, a crisis of ordinary people dying, then I will continue to protest. I will not stop, I will not be a bystander while this Government betrays its people.'\\n'I have four grandchildren and they are the greatest concern in my life because my understanding of the temperature that the earth is heading towards is going to be mighty difficult for them and their generation,' he said.\\n'I have a very strong belief that this man Jesus shows me the way of life, which is giving all our use for others... I appreciate this principle that the order of my life is to, as far as I can, to put others first.\\n'The poorest people in the world who have done the least to cause these high temperatures are the ones who are suffering the most from extremes of weather.\\n'They don't have the resources that we have (in the UK) to in some way cope reasonably with what is happening to us.'\\nKingston, from south Wales and now living in Patchway, south Gloucestershire, told the court he worked as a lecturer at Bristol University for 27 years, and he had been employed as a probation officer before this.\\nHe said he hoped to appeal to the public and the Government about 'climate breakdown' through the protest, adding that some passengers did 'engage' with his views on the day.\\n'I hope to achieve the attention of fellow citizens and also of the Government, who I believe are responding quite inadequately to the huge dangers we are facing in regard to the climate and I wanted to draw attention to that,' he said.\\nKingston said the 'safety of passengers was the primary consideration' of the group's planning ahead of the stunt, and he was as certain 'as humanly possible' that no-one would be put at risk.\\nWhen asked whether, if the safety of passengers had been in question, he would still have proceeded with the stunt, he said: 'No, not at all.'\\nHe added that initially passengers reacted angrily, but after he spoke with those nearby, 'the anger subsided and they were beginning to engage'.\\nEdmund Blackman, prosecuting, earlier told jurors: 'It is the prosecution case that these three defendants each played a part in obstructing the DLR that morning in a planned operation designed to bring the service of one of the lines to a halt by stopping the train.\\n'The timing of that obstruction was not a coincidence. They were at Shadwell station shortly before 7am so at the beginning of the rush hour.\\n'The action of these three defendants had a purpose, they weren't just doing it for the fun of it. Their actions come under the broad umbrella of Extinction Rebellion.\\n'Whilst that was the motivation behind the defendants' behaviour and their actions it's the prosecution case that these defendants went beyond what is permitted or allowed in society in that protest. They went too far.'\\nJurors saw footage from a body worn camera showing members of the public yelling statements including 'I don't give a f*** what it is, get the f*** off the train,' and 'This is a f***ing electric train, you should be supporting this.\\nDefence lawyer Owen Greenall said that since Shadwell station is one stop away from Bank the protesters were 'targeting the infrastructure that supports the financial institutions of the city'.\\nHe argued that the protest was carried out 'in a safe manner' with the defendants taking measures such as targeting an open-top station so that no trains would be stuck in tunnels, and having several more people from Extinction Rebellion on the platform to ensure violence did not break out.\\nMr Greenall added that disruption to passengers was 'relatively short-lived' with trains running again by 8am.\\nHe summarised: 'The issue about which they were protesting was and is so important and urgent that the degree of their disruption to users of the railway was justified.'\\nLast month six XR activists were cleared by a jury of halting the DLR by mounting a protest at Canary Wharf station on April 25, 2019.\\nFive of them, including Kingston, climbed on top of the train with banners that read 'Business As Usual=Death' and 'Don't Jail the Canaries'; a reference to fellow protesters who were facing prosecution at the time. The sixth, Dr Diana Warner, glued herself to a train window.\\nLast March Parfitt glued herself to a desk at Westminster Magistrates' Court and live-streamed proceedings on Facebook after she was convicted of breaching a section 14 order during an XR protest in September 2020.\\nShe was cleared of bringing traffic to a standstill during an XR protest on October 7, 2019 after charges against the reverend and two other environmentalists were withdrawn.", "image": [["Father Martin Newell, 54, and Reverend Sue Parfitt, 79,\u00a0used a ladder to climb on the DLR roof as\u00a0part of an
