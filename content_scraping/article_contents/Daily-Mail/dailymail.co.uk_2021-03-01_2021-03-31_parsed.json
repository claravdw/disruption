The protest was originally organised by campaign group Reclaim These Streets before they were forced to cancel it by police. Sisters Uncut stepped in in their place.\\n5.45pm - A man walks onto the bandstand to make a speech, and begins shouting angrily about Ms Everard's death and ranting about Covid rules. Some people respond with boos and chants of 'not your place'. He is later led away by police.\\n6pm - A minute's silence is held for Ms Everard. There are now around 500 people on the event, according to Sky News. The crowds began chanting 'we will not be silenced' as the police presence increases. An aerial photo shows officers dotted among the closely-packed crowd.\\n6.27pm - A group of women leading chants from the bandstand are asked to leave by officers, who explain that the event is breaking Covid rules. The crowd respond with chants of 'Shame on you' as officers continue talking to the women.\\n6.33pm - More police vans arrive and around 10 officers began walking towards the bandstand. An officer says over a loudspeaker, 'This is no longer a vigil, it's an unlawful gathering, we're in the middle of a pandemic. You are going to get more officers coming here.'

A shout of 'no!' is heard from people in the crowd. 'Are you sure?', Ms Stevenson adds. 'Yes!' the crowd responds. Ms Stevenson then says: 'Then the police should go home. I'm done with being bullied by police.'\\n7.20pm - A woman is seen on video being forcefully led away by three officers. A minute later police repeat their warning that people have to leave and also post this on Twitter.\\n7.22pm - A group of police grab a woman standing on the bandstand just along from Patsy Stevenson and move her to a police van, to jeers from the crowd.

She was arrested and fined \u00a3200.\\n7.42pm - After chants of 'all cops are b******s', and two arrests, a group of officers are surrounded by the crowd.

This is a tactic previously used by pro-cycling activists and Extinction Rebellion campaigners.\\n5.20pm - Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick confirms she is not planning to resign.\\n5.40pm - There is another minute's silence, with people raising their fists in the air, according to a live blog by My London News.\\n6pm - The crowd dissipates as the protest draws to a close.\\n\\nGroups riding on the coat-tails of those fighting for justice for Sarah include environmentalists, socialists, animal rights activists and Stop Brexit campaigners who have all been in Clapham and Parliament Square in recent days.\\nTonight another protest is planned in Westminster, which will also be in opposition of Boris Johnson's Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill.\\nSisters Uncut was formed in 2014 by activists Janelle Brown and Vicky Ford to support victims of domestic violence, and found fame for stunts including jumping on the red carpet at the West End premiere of the movie 'Suffragette' starring Carey Mulligan and Helena Bonham Carter and later dying the Trafalgar Square fountains red.\\nSisters Uncut say the police are institutionally violent against women and cannot be trusted with women's safety.\\nIt has put out a 'call to arms' on social media for people to join them in London tonight and said: 'The police protect themselves. The police do not keep us safe, and plainclothes police won't protect us. On Saturday night, the police were drunk with power. And now the Government is voting to give them more power. We say no'.\\nSisters Uncut has been backed by BLM UK and Extinction Rebellion, who were behind the most high profile protests in Britain over the past few years where police took the knee and were accused of not being tough enough on protesters who ran riot.\\nBut on Saturday night the Met was accused of being heavy-handed in its treatment of some of the protesters who turned out in force to remember Sarah Everard and lay flowers at Clapham Common's bandstand.\\nThe vigil had originally been organised by the protest group Reclaim These Streets before it was forced to cancel after police said it would be in breach of coronavirus rules. Its organiser Anna Birley said on Monday she did not want Dame Cressida to resign.\\nBut it was then that Sisters Uncut stepped in, tweeting: 'To all those still thinking of heading to Clapham Common: we will be there! Please bring your sadness and your rage'.\\nSince then it has led the protests at Westminster, including a large protest outside New Scotland Yard, the Met's headquarters on the Embankment.\\nAnd today they have laid flowers outside parliament spelling out the words 'kill the bill' in a bid for the government to scrap the legislation.\\nSisters Uncut claim they have no leaders or hierarchy.\\nMs Brown said previously that: 'Direct action is something people do when they're absolutely desperate, and the state of domestic violence services is absolutely desperate. But no-one has really batted an eyelid, so we take direct action to be disruptive. Movements like BLM and the suffragettes prove it makes a difference. It's not something you do on a whim, because there's a risk of arrest, so the fact that so many women and non-binary people are willing to do that is really telling.'\\nSisters Uncut also claim to have no political affiliations, but enjoy the support of many left-wing groups including the professional protesters from BLM and Extinction Rebellion.\\nBacking the BLM movement the group said previously: 'Sisters Uncut pledge our commitment and solidarity to Black Lives Matter UK and our black, queer siblings who are leading the movement on this side of the Atlantic.\\n'Black Lives Matter is part of a long struggle by the black community against police and state brutality. Though it was founded in the US, the parallels with police and state violence in the UK cannot be ignored'.\\nToday the Reclaim These Streets movement appeared to further back away from organising the protests.\\nIn a series of tweets the group said: 'This movement does not belong to us. This movement belongs to all women, especially those failed by men and by the Police most: black and brown, queer, disabled and trans women'.\\nRTS also paid tribute to Sisters Uncut and other groups including End Violence against Women, the Centre for Women's Justice, Black Protest Legal Support UK and lawyers from Green & Black Cross.\\nIt came as a police federation chief has defended the actions of officers at the vigil for Sarah Everard and claimed the event had been 'hijacked' by Antifa, Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion protesters.\\nFootage from the vigil shows mourners packed together around floral tributes left for Ms Everard - with a number of demonstrators shouting: 'No justice, no peace, f*** the police.'\\nOne of the attendees, stood next to the person filming, had brought a megaphone.\\nDemonstrators marched through the streets of London for the second night on Monday, with crowds gathering in Parliament Square and outside New Scotland Yard before briefly blocking traffic on Westminster Bridge - amid growing pressure on the Government to tackle violence against women.\\nBoris Johnson has now unveiled plans to place plain-clothed police officers in nightclubs, while also spending \u00a345million on improving street lights and CCTV coverage to better protect women after thousands took to the streets demanding action to protect women from predators.\\nOne of Sarah Everard's friends has criticised the way her death has been 'politicised', saying, 'This is not what Sarah would have wanted'.\\nHelena Edwards, who attended Durham University with the 33-year-old marketing executive, said she had planned to attend her vigil on Clapham Common on Saturday but decided not to over fears her death had been 'hijacked'.\\nExplaining that many of Ms Everard's other friends also decided not to go, she claimed it was 'not a tribute to her anymore' but had been taken over by political campaigners.\\nWriting in Spiked Magazine, she said it was wrong to try and blame other people for the actions of one 'psychopath', adding: 'Sarah was a victim of one of the most horrific crimes imaginable. She was extremely unlucky \u2013 that is all there is to it.\\n'Her abduction and murder is not, in my opinion, a symptom of a sexist, dangerous society. When something awful like this happens there is a rush to look for reasons and apportion blame.\\n'If the suspect police officer in custody is eventually tried and found guilty of her murder, then I will hold him alone responsible. I will not be blaming ''men'' or ''the police'' for the actions of one individual.'\\nMs Edwards said that her friend 'knew many wonderful men' in her life, several of whom had played key roles in the effort to try and find her.\\nShe continued: 'I don't think Sarah would have wanted them, or men in general, to be smeared with the same brush as her attacker. Most people, and indeed men, are good.\\n'They would never wish harm on anyone else, let alone attack or kill someone. Despite what has happened to Sarah allegedly at the hands of this man, I will continue to believe that.'\\nMs Edwards also described as 'ridiculous' a proposal by Green Party peer Baroness Jenny Jones to subject men to a 6pm curfew, as she vowed not to 'live in fear' when social activities began again after the end of lockdown.\\nPaying tribute to Sarah, she concluded: 'I will miss my friend deeply. I am so sad she will never see the end of lockdown and, as her friends, we will never get to enjoy these experiences with her again.'\\nSaturday's vigil saw four people arrested amid ugly scenes of scuffles between police and mourners that have sparked intense criticism of the Met Police.\\nCampaign group Reclaim These Streets, which originally organised Saturday's vigil on Clapham Common, said it has 'lost our confidence' in Dame Cressida Dick, following a meeting today.\\nIn a statement on Twitter, the group said on Monday it was invited to meet with Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, deputy mayor for policing Sophie Linden and London victims' commissioner Claire Waxman, and later with Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida.\\nReclaim These Streets said: 'Despite this issue being top of the news agenda and our flexibility with timings, she provided us just 15 minutes of her time to discuss both the right to protest and women's safety.\\n'We pressed the commissioner for a clear answer on what an acceptable form of a vigil would be under the legislation, and she refused to provide an answer.'\\nCampaign group Reclaim These Streets said it was 'considering our legal options' following the process.\\nIt continued: 'We asked Commissioner Dick to waive the fines of women who attended the vigil at Clapham Common on Saturday, but she flat out refused, even though it was her force's decisions that forced women into this position.\\n'We believe we have given Commissioner Dick and the Metropolitan Police more than enough opportunities to demonstrate that they are committed to policing by consent and allowing people to use their rights.\\n'She has lost our confidence in her ability to lead the urgent changes needed to tackle institutional misogyny and racism in the Metropolitan Police, and she has clearly lost the confidence of London's women too, and we urge her to consider her position.'\\nThe group has also asked Mr Khan for meaningful funding behind the Violence Against Women and Girls Strategy, a ring-fenced fund for specialist domestic and sexual violence organisations, for the mayor to back calls to criminalise street harassment and demand Dame Cressida commit to training every Met Police officer on misogyny, sexism and anti-racism.\\n\\nMet Commissioner Cressida Dick has rejected calls for her resignation, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had full confidence in her.\\nPatsy Stevenson - who was pictured being pinned to the ground, handcuffed and arrested by two male officers - has also called for the agenda to shift away from politics and back towards how to stop violence against women.\\n'I accidentally went viral. I didn't want this to happen. This happened like a whirlwind,' she said on Sky News.\\n'I've been thrown into the public eye and the only way I can make this not in vain is to not make it political, not against the police.

Shadow domestic violence minister Jess Phillips said it was 'disgusting and untrue, adding:\u00a0'The Conservative Government's Bill does absolutely nothing currently to increase sentences for rapists, stalkers, or those who batter, control and abuse women. It does nothing about street harassment and assaults.\\n'Under the Conservatives rape convictions have fallen to an all time low, and domestic abuse conviction rates are dropping off a cliff.'\\nThe law is being introduced after a host of memorials and statues across the country have been damaged in the past year as a result of increasing tensions over Britain's colonial history.\\nThey included the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square, and the new law would bar protests from outside the House of Parliament.\\nBut human rights lawyers warned that the bill would make powers handed to police under Covid regulations permanent even after the lockdown is lifted.\\nOne, Adam Wagner,\u00a0tweeted:\u00a0'You may think the events of the past few days have shown beyond doubt that the police cannot be trusted to protect our free speech rights.

'Not In My Back Yard' is now the default response to any proposal for building anything bigger than a shed.\\nSuggest a few houses on the edge of a village and locals will be up in arms. Announce plans for a new supermarket, and a militant residents' action group will be up and running by teatime (unless it is a Waitrose). As for a wind turbine, well, that is a declaration of war.\\nExcept in this one rugged corner of the kingdom, however. I am standing in Britain's only Nimby-free zone.\\nThe people of Whitehaven, and the surrounding borough of Copeland, do not just live contentedly alongside the largest nuclear site in Europe, Sellafield. They also find themselves next to the proposed location of Britain's first new deep coal mine this century. And I do not hear a bat squeak of protest from them.\\nThis will be no modest operation here on the west Cumbrian coast. The plans are for a whopper, with shafts running four miles out into the Irish Sea, a quarter of a mile beneath the waves. The site will employ more than 500 people and produce millions of tons of coal, which will travel along its own railway to link up with the main network.\\nThe proposed colliery is due to be built on open land right in front of a new housing development. So what do local people have to say?\\n'We're all for it. Everyone wants this mine,' says Steve Nicholson, a Sellafield union leader whose home will actually overlook the colliery if it takes shape. 'The only people against it are those who are not from round here.'\\nMining is in the local DNA. Coal is to Whitehaven as brewing is to Burton. What residents object to is being painted as a bunch of desperate throwbacks to the days of pit ponies, canaries and emaciated children in baskets being lowered into the sulphurous gloom.\\nThe hefty old pithead machinery still looms above the town and the sea but it is a monument (and once part of a museum) to an old pit that finally closed in 1986. The new one, Woodhouse Colliery, will be a low-lying, futuristic facility on the overgrown site of a former chemical works a mile away.\\nWhitehaven is not sitting on any old coal. It straddles seams of top-quality metallurgical 'coking' coal essential to steel production.\\nNo amount of Extinction Rebellion stunts can alter the fact that the world still needs steel. We need it to make hospitals and schools and, yes, eco-friendly solar panels, wind turbines and electric cars.\\nTo make all that steel, we need metallurgical coal. And, at present, steelworks in the UK and Europe must buy that coal from the U.S.\\nSo a company called West Cumbria Mining has applied to do the same job much closer to home \u2014 saving the cost and emissions incurred by importing millions of tons across the Atlantic. In doing so, it will breathe new life into this part of the UK.\\nThere will be no Victorian cages clanking down into the bowels of the earth. These miners (including Britain's first female colliers) will be driven to the automated coalface in electric 4x4s. With projected salaries of about \u00a350,000-\u00a360,000, it's no surprise that 1,500 people have already pre-registered for a job. Everyone's itching to get down t'pit.\\n'I put my name down as soon as I heard,' says Neil Messenger, 57, who worked in the old colliery until it closed, spent 25 years as a fireman, and now wants to get mining again.\\n'You can't beat that camaraderie. No job like it.'\\nUnfortunately for Neil, his family and everyone else, however, their plans have now been derailed by a combination of council jobsworths, environmental activists and a cabal of knee-jerk Westminster coal-haters \u2014 with Labour, of all people, leading the charge.\\nIf it's not strange enough to be in a town built on coal and rugby league that is now run by Tories, it's even odder to find that the people fighting hardest to close the local pit (before it even opens) are the heirs to Keir Hardie and Arthur Scargill.\\nLocal Labour county councillor Emma Williamson, who backs the colliery, is sad to admit to me that she finds herself a 'rebel' for defending miners in an old mining town.\\nThe Labour argument is that the coal mine will increase Britain's carbon emissions and must, therefore, be stopped at all costs.\\nTo which the people of Whitehaven point out that those emissions are going to happen anyway, since we still need steel. So do we want to pay American miners and pretend to be virtuous planet-saving good guys? Or do we want to pay our own?\\nAdding fuel (literally) to the fire is the fact that Britain is preparing to host this year's UN COP26 global climate change summit. Boris Johnson's Government wants the world to sign up to big cuts in carbon emissions. How can we possibly do that, many argue, if we are simultaneously opening a new coal mine?\\nIt is this which has stalled seven years of planning here in Whitehaven. 'No new mine in history has been scrutinised as carefully as this one,' says Mark Kirkbride, the Teeside-born geologist who runs West Cumbria Mining. Cumbria County Council's development committee has overwhelmingly approved the plans three times.\\nHowever, with the summit approaching, opponents have been piling pressure on both the council and the Government to intervene. In January, Lord Deben, the former Tory minister John Gummer who chairs the UK's advisory Climate Change Committee, urged the Government to scrap the mine scheme.\\nLast month Labour's Shadow Business Secretary, Ed Miliband, appeared on telly saying: 'We can't be opening new coal mines.'\\nAlmost immediately, the Labour leader of Cumbria County Council took the hint, ignored all past decisions by his development committee and told members to think again. At which point, Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick finally 'called in' the plan, urged on by Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng.\\nIt will now be the subject of yet another public inquiry in September, just weeks before the summit starts.\\nThe antis have been joined by a grand alliance of international schmoozers, led by former U.S. secretary of state John Kerry, America's envoy to the talks.\\n'Coal is not the future,' he pronounced on the BBC when Newsnight asked him about Cumbria the other day. 'All over the world, coal plants are closing.'\\nYet his own country produces 600 million tons per year, while Cumbria is proposing to extract just 0.5 per cent of that amount. 'Isn't it odd,' observes West Cumbria Mining's Mark Kirkbride, 'that someone from a country with huge mining interests is saying the UK should not open a new mine?'\\nBesides, the interview is misleading. Mr Kerry was talking about coal production in general (most coal is burned to generate electricity, something Britain has stopped doing altogether). The BBC did not point out to him that Cumbria's coal is only for making steel.\\n'No investment firm is going to invest in a new coal plant,' declared the omniscient Mr Kerry, clearly unaware that West Cumbria Mining's investors have already sunk \u00a336 million into this one.\\nIt all adds to the sense of far-away know-alls scuppering a scheme that seems entirely logical here in Cumbria. A few also feel that southern bien pensants want to punish the area for being ardently pro-Brexit.\\nThat's the view on the streets of Whitehaven, where I can find no one who is opposed to the scheme. Not a single one.\\n'We're in a pandemic and you've got a chance of 500 jobs?' says paramedic Brandon Berry, 24. 'What are we waiting for?' I see no signs against the mine, no posters, not even graffiti.\\nThere has been the odd demonstration, but not by locals. A few months back, a handful of Extinction Rebellion protesters from elsewhere turned up at the county council offices, posed for the cameras then drove home.\\nMany Cumbrians are opposed to the mine, but they hail from the tourist-dependent Beatrix Potter/Lake District part of the county, and not its industrial perimeter.\\n'This town understands energy and is not afraid of it,' says Mike Starkie, the executive mayor of Copeland and, as it happens, a Conservative. 'People need to stop looking at metallurgical coal as a thing of the past. This whole project is driven by the latest technology.'\\nMr Starkie explains that the colliery will not just produce 500 direct jobs but bring at least another 1,500 supply-chain jobs to a local workforce with some formidable brains. With Sellafield up the road, he points out, one in five workers round here is a graduate.\\nWhitehaven's main shopping street is now a run-down via dolorosa of empty spaces, but there are encouraging signs, too.\\nThe former bus station is about to reopen as a Google-style hub for 'tech, digital, media, and creative start-ups' with a 100-seat restaurant attached.\\nIt has a full list of tenants and owner, BEC, the local regeneration firm, has plans for a new hotel and training centre overlooking the handsome Georgian harbour.\\nIt's why the locals resent being patronised by southern eco-zealots who think that coal mining belongs in an L.S. Lowry painting and who can't be bothered to study the specifics of this case. 'People around here are more technically literate than almost anywhere else I know,' says local borough councillor Steven Morgan. He is no naive sentimentalist. He is actually a retired U.S. navy rear admiral and Vietnam veteran who served in nuclear submarines before running major infrastructure projects at Sellafield, Heathrow and for the Ministry of Defence.\\nWhitehaven bus station is the last place I would expect to be discussing energy policy with an American admiral \u2014 but then this town does have the distinction of being the only place in Britain ever invaded by the U.S. (in an abortive raid in 1778).\\nRear Admiral Morgan, 72, tells me he would still be a Liberal Democrat were it not for the party's opposition to the mine. Instead, he sits on Copeland council as an independent.\\n'This country needs a steel industry and that steel industry needs coking as part of a mixed bag of energy sources,' he says.\\nIn his view, the only reason that the mine has been blocked is 'because this summit means that Boris Johnson has a hypocrisy problem'. He is confident that once the summit is over, the Government will give the mine a green light anyway.\\nAfter all, with more than enough coal for UK steel plants, this mine will also export to Europe.\\nWho would have imagined, just a few years ago, that a proud northern town like Whitehaven would have a Tory mayor and MP?\\nTrudy Harrison has won here three times on the trot and is parliamentary private secretary to Boris Johnson. She is passionately pro-mine. 'We need steel for just about all manufacturing \u2014 anyone saying we don't is in cloud cuckoo land,' she told her local paper.\\nNeighbouring Workington is a former steel town, where the revolutionary Bessemer steel process was pioneered and made most of the world's railway tracks.\\nWhen analysts tried to explain the collapse of Labour's so-called northern 'Red Wall' at the last election, many pointed to 'Workington Man' (and Woman). As one senior Tory argued, London-based eco-zealots are doing their best to turn it into 'Woke-ington'.\\nThe town's Tory MP, Mark Jenkinson, says that many there are desperate for the jobs which the mine will generate.\\nHe pooh-poohs environmentalists' talk of giving people unspecified 'green jobs' and of using hydrogen for steel-making.\\n'The hydrogen technology simply isn't there yet,' says a man who actually worked at the town's British Steel plant. 'So what are steelworks going to burn instead? Tyres? Wood?'\\nThe one Cumbrian MP opposed to the mine is the county's only non-Tory MP, Tim Farron.\\nThe former Lib Dem leader accepts there is an issue with U.S. coal imports, but says the UK must do all it can to push the steel industry away from coal. 'Making it easier for them to carry on using coal is like giving the alcoholic another drink,' he argues.\\nIn short, this boils down to a simple question: should we pay our own people to get their hands dirty or pay another country to do the work? Do we choose pragmatism or piety?\\nIn Whitehaven, they don't want virtuous self-flagellation. They want jobs.", "image": [["For better or worse, we have become a nation of Nimbys.

Such timidity fuels flames.'\\nMilitary archaeologist Michael Hellis wrote online: 'Violence that broke out during a \"Kill The Bill\" protest was caused by people who \"came for a fight with police\", Bristol's chief constable has said.\\n'Surely even the Avon and Somerset chief constable realises the significance of the title of this riot. The Old Bill = the police.'\\nIan Acheson, prison and security commentator, added: 'Kill\u00a0the Bill or Kill the Old Bill?\\n'If you're sheltering under the delusion that this had \"anything\" to do with defending legitimate protest, you're in the company of people who would have thought it a good night's work if there were human beings inside that van.'\\nAt least 20 officers were injured as a 'mob of animals' tore through Bristol, setting police vehicles on fire, vandalising NHS workers' cars, hurling fireworks and smashing the windows of a police station in a 'night of thuggery'.\\nBut Andy Marsh, chief constable of Avon and Somerset Police, claimed the event had been 'hijacked by extremists' and said\u00a0there was no 'prior intelligence' that any disorder was planned 'on this scale'.\\nLast night, professional anarchists including one dubbed 'the most dangerous man in Britain' stirred up the protests into a shameful night of violence.\\nSisters Uncut, who organised Kill the Bill marches in cities around the country, hailed the action.\\nAnd veteran agitator Ian Bone - the left-wing activist best known for gleefully abusing the children of Jacob Rees-Mogg outside their home - also shared his approval of the violence.\\nAs pictures of the carnage emerged, he gloated about the fires, attacking the city's mayor who had urged calm: 'All hail the Bristol uprising - Marvin Rees go f*** yourself'.\\n'Bristol always has and will be...riot city.'\\nCritics have suggested police in Bristol were scared to intervene when violence spilled onto the streets, in the aftermath of criticism levelled at Scotland Yard last week.\\nAsked whether the criticism faced by the Metropolitan Police over the vigil for Sarah Everard had made a difference to how his officers behaved, Chief Constable Marsh said: 'Every protest and the police response to it needs to be dealt with in the context of that protest.'\\nHe said today:\u00a0'A tactical decision was made to deal with these criminals retrospectively and not make a significant number of arrests last night, which would have impacted significantly on our resources at the scene and created a greater risk of damage to property and injuries to the reduced number of officers left to deal with the disorder.\\n'There was a hardcore of serious criminals hidden within those 3,000 people - perhaps 400 or 500 people - and we certainly didn't trigger this.\\n'By the time it got to 5.30pm, it became clear that whatever we did we would not be able to avoid a very violent confrontation.'\\nAround 3,000 activists,\u00a0claiming to protect the right to demonstrate peacefully, had gathered in the city centre on Sunday for the demonstration to oppose plans to give police more powers to deal with non-violent protests.\\nBut 500 stayed behind to riot, and police headquarters came under siege as hooded yobs armed with baseball bats tried to smash the windows of the glass-fronted New Bridewell Station, while others attempted to scale the facade and some lobbed missiles at officers.\\nOthers were also seen appearing to defecate at the feet of police officers.\\nPictures taken at the scene and circulating on social media show protesters crouching at the feet of shielded police officers and beginning to defecate, while woman was photographed clearly urinating in front of a row of riot police.\\nThe city's Mayor today described the behaviour as 'pathetic and politically illiterate.'\\nHe also slammed the\u00a0'self-indulgent, self-centred revolutionary tourists looking for a conflict to take advantage of.'\\nSeven people have been arrested so far - six for violent disorder and one for possession of an offensive weapon.\\nOne of those arrested during the Bristol riot last night came from 80-miles away, the protester came to Bristol from Reading in Berkshire - an hour and 20-minutes drive down the M4.\u00a0The other six held are from the Bristol area.\\nA total of 20 officers were injured and two were taken to hospital suffering broken bones after being stamped on, pelted with stones and beaten with sticks in the violent skirmishes. One also suffered a punctured lung.\\nChief constable Marsh said 12 police vehicles were damaged, including two that were set on fire, and 'significant damage' was caused to the New Bridewell police station.\\nAs a huge clean-up operation gets underway, Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees said the so-called activists were 'a group of people running around the country looking for any opportunity to enter into physical conflict with police or representatives of what they see as the establishment.'\\nAnd Boris Johnson described the violent scenes that marred the protest in Bristol as 'unacceptable'.\\nThe 'Kill the Bill' protest in Bristol was organised against the Government's Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which could see the police handed more powers to tackle demonstrations.\\nThe wide-ranging proposals, as part of efforts to overhaul the justice system, cut offending and make streets safer, also include laws to reform sentencing, the courts and handling offenders.\\nIf passed, some of the measures will be UK-wide while others may only apply in England and Wales.\\n- What are the key measures proposed in the Bill?\\n- Whole life orders for premeditated murder of a child, allowing judges to also hand out the maximum sentence to 18 to 20-year-olds in exceptional cases, like for acts of terrorism leading to mass loss of life.\\n- Powers to halt the automatic early release of offenders who pose a danger to the public and end the automatic release halfway through a sentence of serious violent and sexual offenders.\\n- Introducing life sentences for killer drivers.\\n- Expanding position-of-trust laws to make it illegal for sports coaches and religious leaders to engage in sexual activity with 16 and 17-year-olds in their care.\\n- Will the police have more power under the Bill?\\nPotentially. The legislation looks to toughen up powers the police have to tackle 'non-violent' protests which are significantly disruptive to the public or on access to Parliament.\\nThe proposed law includes an offence of 'intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance'.\\nAccording to the Bill, someone commits this crime if they cause 'serious harm to the public', which can include 'serious annoyance, serious inconvenience or serious loss of amenity'. Those convicted could face a fine or jail.\\nThe plans could also see police given powers to impose more conditions on static protests, like time and noise limits, and extend the rules to one-person demonstrations.\\nMeanwhile, the Government is also seeking to increase the maximum penalty for criminal damage to a memorial from three months to 10 years, under the Bill.\\nThe laws could also see police have more powers to crack down on unauthorised encampments which interfere with the ability to use the land.\\nOfficers could also be allowed to stop and search people more if plans for serious violence reduction orders go ahead.\\nThis would make it easier to carry out checks on those who have previously been convicted of carrying a knife.\\n- What about other measures for victims?\\nThe Bill seeks to reverse bail reforms which led to suspects accused of serious and violent crimes being released without restrictions, and instead imposing conditions if they could pose a risk to victims, witnesses or the public.\\nLaws could also be introduced to allow police to obtain search warrants to help find human remains where it is not possible to bring about a prosecution, such as where a suspect has died, is unfit to plead or has already been convicted of the offence in the absence of a body.\\n- Are there plans to provide more protection for police officers?\\nYes, Home Secretary Priti Patel wants to double the maximum sentence for assaulting an emergency worker to two years and enshrine a Police Covenant in law to protect serving and retired officers and their families.\\n- What are the other measures proposed in the Bill?\\n- The amount of time offenders can be subject to curfews could be doubled to two years.\\n- A legal duty could be placed on councils, police, criminal justice bodies, health and fire services to tackle serious violence and share intelligence and data.\\n- Homicide reviews could be carried out for deaths of adults involving offensive weapons, to try to better understand and prevent violent crime.\\n- Profoundly deaf people could be allowed to sit on juries for the first time, by allowing a British sign language interpreter into a jury deliberation room.\\n\\nAfter a night of violent rioting, it emerged today:\\nPriti Patel criticised the 'anarchic and violent' scenes in Bristol, telling MPs: 'We have been clear that to save lives and fight this pandemic, people must not currently hold large gatherings. Too many this weekend selfishly decided that this did not apply to them.\\n'We will always give the police the support and the protection that they need and it is sad, as we saw last week, that the Opposition voted against measures to protect our police and also introduce longer sentences.'\\nThe Home Secretary also told the Commons: 'The scenes in Bristol yesterday were utterly shameful. We saw criminal thuggery and disorder caused by a minority who put lives at risk.\\n'Our exceptional and brave police officers put themselves in harm's way to protect the public. For them to face the criminal violence against them while upholding the law is completely unacceptable.\\n'My thoughts are with the injured officers and their family, and I hope that every single Member of Parliament in this House will join me in condemning the shameful actions of the criminal minority involved.'\\nSpeaking to broadcasters at BAE Systems in Preston, the Prime Minister said today: 'I think all that kind of thing is unacceptable and the people obviously have a right to protest in this country.\\n'But they should protest peacefully and legally.'\\nAvon and Somerset Police Chief Constable Andy Marsh said there was no 'prior intelligence' that any disorder was planned 'on this scale'.\\n'No specific organiser was identified prior to the event but we did engage with a number of organisations who had expressed an interest in attending to discourage them due to the current Covid-19 restrictions,' he said.\\n'We hoped stressing the sacrifices the Bristol community had made over the past year would deter people from attending.\\n'A tactical decision was made to deal with these criminals retrospectively and not make a significant number of arrests last night, which would have impacted significantly on our resources at the scene and created a greater risk of damage to property and injuries to the reduced number of officers left to deal with the disorder.\\n'What the public will see now is a huge police investigation in which we'll be gathering evidence from CCTV, body-worn video, social media content and images or video sent in by the public.'\\nAsked whether the much-criticised way the Metropolitan Police handled the vigil for murdered Sarah Everard earlier this month had made a difference to how officers behaved in Bristol, Mr Marsh said: 'Every protest and the police response to it needs to be dealt with in the context of that protest.'\\nThe Met faced widespread criticism for the way it dealt with the vigil in Clapham Common, south London, where officers handcuffed and removed several women who had come out during lockdown in memory of Ms Everard.\\nChief Constable Marsh told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'By the time it got to to 5.30pm, it became clear that whatever we did we would not be able to avoid a very violent confrontation.\\n'Once that has happened a handful of officers making a small number of arrests when there is a crowd of 100 damaging vehicles, throwing missiles and throwing fireworks at us - that would not be a good response, that would just put the people who remained in more danger.'\\nHe added: 'Let's be clear, the wanton violence and destruction had nothing to do with protest - it was committed by those looking for an excuse to commit disorder.\\n'The scenes we witnessed yesterday were shameful and I know will be condemned by the whole city.\\n'We've received messages of support from across the policing, emergency service and political landscape.\\n'No-one wants to see police officers abused or attacked in this way. These men and women put their safety on the line every day to keep the public safe and do not deserve to be on the forefront of this abhorrent criminal behaviour.\\n'20 of our brave officers suffered various injuries - including two who suffered more serious injuries which needed hospital treatment.\\n'I was at a Bristol station last night and can tell you the feeling of anguish was felt by all our officers and staff at seeing colleagues injured while on the front line.'\\nThe Mayor of Bristol said he was 'disgusted' with the violence on the streets of his city.\\nHe added: 'It also points out the political illiteracy of those people on our streets doing this violence last night. What has injuring police officers, smashing windows, burning cars got to do with the challenges we face as a city right now?'\\nAppearing on Good Morning Britain today, he added: 'What we had last night, there were many people who went out and made their voices heard but there were these group of people, irrespective of the issue they were out there to cause problems for whatever revolutionary fantasy they're playing at.\\n'We're not going to let them take away what we've built in recent years.\\n'It would be quite interesting in the mop up, not just to have these people arrested, but to see where they actually come from, because I imagine a few are not actually from this city, but are revolutionary tourists as it were.'\\nMayor Marvin Rees added: 'There is a debate to be had and there's debate to be had about all proposed Government legislation.\\n'But I think there are particular concerns about this Bill and we'll speak about those more on another occasion.\\n'But the violence that happened in a city last night goes nowhere to actually reducing the likelihood of this Bill winning support. In fact, it does quite the contrary.\\n'People from those communities who have been on the rough end of the criminal justice system are now in more danger.\\n'It doesn't put them closer to justice, it puts them further away. It runs absolutely against what they claim to be in fighting for - political illiteracy at large.'\\nVeteran activist and grandfather Ian Bone, 71, was once dubbed Britain's most dangerous man after the Class War newspaper he launched in 1982 became so incendiary it featured pictures of beaten up policemen.\\nHis father was butler to Sir Gerald Coke, grandson of the Earl of Leicester, and the family lived in a bonded cottage on a family estate in Hampshire.\\nYoung Ian hated the rich children 'from the big house' for calling his father 'Bone' and grew up with an abiding contempt for the upper classes.\\nAfter finishing a degree in politics from Swansea University, he announced to his horrified parents that his choice of 'career' was to be an anarchist, and that he would fund it by claiming the dole.\\nThe full-time anarchist \u2013 who's been on state benefits since leaving university \u2013 now walks with a stick due to Parkinson's disease.\\n\\nBone has been protesting since the 1980s and is a publisher with class activist publications, Class War and The Bristolian.\u00a0He became a founding member of Class War, a group dedicated to the violent overthrow of state structures, and published newspapers in support of the cause.\\nAt its height it sold 15,000 copies weekly and supported striking miners, dockers, print workers and demos including the Brixton Riots of 1981, before the publication was launched.\\nBone went on Bash the Rich marches (Bash the Rich is also the title of his autobiography). Just a decade ago he advocated violence to overthrow the state.\\nWhile still a weekly paper, Class War dubbed itself 'Britain's most unruly tabloid'.\\nAfter Prince William's birth in September 1984 it carried a front page picture of him with the headline 'Another f***ing royal parasite'.\\nAnother front page carried an image of Margaret Thatcher with a hatchet buried in her head. When the paper folded, it carried on as a pressure group.\\nHe lived in Grenfell from 1983-1986 and knew several residents who were caught up in the fire there where 72 people died.\\nHe went on to protest outside The Shard when Grenfell residents weren't being re-housed because there were 10 \u00a350m empty luxury flats inside the state-of-the-art tower. Bone was taken to the High Court by Qatari royal family, owner of The Shard, in February 2018 to stop his protests before their lawyers withdrew their threat of an injunction against him.\\nIn 2006 he told The Guardian newspaper that violence was key, saying: 'Not (attacking someone) individually, but if you're fighting back as a mob against a particular thing like the poll tax or the Iraq War (then) yes.. If the rich or the ruling class or the police are defending their interests, they deserve everything that's coming to them.'\\nWhen Baroness Thatcher died in 2013, he used his blog to summon an army of followers to celebratory street parties, and published an image of the former prime minister's head being cut open with a meat cleaver. Next to the image he wrote: 'The best cut of all.'\\nIn other film clips posted on YouTube, he rails against the Royal Family and urges 'violent action' to achieve his aims.\\nIn 2015 Bone posted pictures of himself angrily brandishing a walking stick during a protest against the so-called gentrification of London.\\nHe was the key figure behind a mob attack when riot police and helicopters were deployed after more than a thousand people descended on East London to protest against a trendy cafe selling breakfast cereals from around the world for up to \u00a34.40 a bowl.\\nAnd in June 2018 he posted on his own Facebook page in regards to Donald Trump's visit: 'Spend the day idling and drinking around Bond Street/ New Bond street...\u2026\u2026..enter shops......handle the goods....be insolent to the rich... insolence comrades...let insolence win the day.'\\nAfter his unabashed assault on the Rees-Mogg family in 2018, the father-of-five remained silent about his own family.\\n\\nThe Mayor said the riot had nothing to do with the 'real everyday struggles' that people in the city face after 12 months of the pandemic.\\n'It's selfish, it is self-indulgent and self-centred activity - people living out their revolutionary fantasies,' he said. This has nothing to do with being in lockdown for a year. There are people who go around looking for the latest demo.\\n'They look for the opportunity for the flashpoints and I suspect there are a number of people who were here last night who are amongst those. It's got nothing to do with Covid and a lockdown.'\\nThe chairman of the police federation dubbed the rioters 'a mob of animals' while\u00a0Home Secretary Priti Patel branded the scenes 'unacceptable' and said 'thuggery and disorder' would never be tolerated.\\nHealth minister Helen Whately told Sky News this morning: 'What we've seen in Bristol, those protests were completely unacceptable, just disgraceful behaviour in fact.\\n'It was one of these occasions where, if I understand it right, there was a peaceful protest and then a small minority from that protest then turned it very ugly and we saw those scenes of completely unacceptable violence.\\n'Not only the damage and the vandalism of police property but, worse still, injuring police officers, so we're seeing officers with serious injuries and going to hospital. That clearly should not happen, it is unacceptable and inexcusable.'\\nThe Avon and Somerset police and crime commissioner said 'many more' would be arrested in the coming days as officers examined a large amount of CCTV footage from Sunday night's riot.\\nTwenty police officers were injured, two seriously, when what started as a non-violent demonstration turned violent after hundreds of protesters descended on the New Bridewell police station.\\nTwo of these injured were treated in hospital after suffering broken ribs and an arm. Both have since been discharged.\\nPolice said between 2,000 and 3,000 people had gathered at College Green on Sunday to protest against the Government's Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which will see the police handed new powers to tackle demonstrations.\\nHome Secretary Priti Patel described the scenes as unacceptable and said 'thuggery and disorder' would never be tolerated.\\nBristol mayor Marvin Rees, who said he had 'major concerns' about the Government's Bill, condemned the thuggery but said the disorder would be used to justify the legislation.\\nSue Mountstevens, police and crime commissioner for Avon and Somerset, said seven people had been arrested so far and there would be 'many more' detained.\\nShe\u00a0said: 'I cannot condemn enough the scenes of violence and destruction that we witnessed yesterday and I know these feelings are felt by the majority of the city and beyond.\\n'20 officers were injured last night and this is unacceptable.\\n'These men and women went to work yesterday with public safety as their number one priority and still faced a level of violence that cannot be justified.\\n'Such a violent demonstration is shameful at any time, let alone during a pandemic that has seen local people make many sacrifices.\\n'Those who clearly acted with intent to cause damage and destruction showed reckless disregard for the safety of local people, police officers and the general community.\\n'The financial cost of this to the public is also going to be substantial.'\\nFootage captured the descent into anarchy as protesters clashed with police armed with batons and pepper spray. Mounted officers were seen attempting to disperse a large crowd gathered outside Bridewell Police Station.\\nLater a group of hooded protesters tried to smash the windows of the glass-fronted police station and another mob set fire to a police van parked in nearby Bridewell Street.\\nProtesters managed to get up onto the roof of the first floor of the police station and rained down missiles on the police, who lined up to defend the entrance of the police station.\\nThree police vans were driven into the area, but one was damaged, had its tyres let down and then a fire was built underneath it, burning it out completely as darkness fell.\\nIn other scenes, officers with police dogs were seen attempting to hold back large crowds as demonstrators scaled the walls of the police station and threw fireworks.\\nOther videos and pictures on social media showed dozens of officers in riot gear guarding the entrance to the station and protesters trying to roll a police van daubed with graffiti.\\nShadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds today condemned the 'appalling' and 'completely unacceptable' violence in Bristol.\\nHe told the BBC news channel: 'Of course, I agree with legitimate protest in a Covid-safe and secure and peaceful way - that is one of the things that is most precious about our democracy - but there is no link between that and the appalling scenes that we saw last night.\\n'That violence which we saw last night, which was completely unacceptable, does absolutely nothing for the cause of those of us who are making perfectly legitimate arguments about concerns around the Policing Bill which in the way that it seeks to limit protests.'\\nMeanwhile\u00a0Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the events in Bristol were 'inexcusable' and 'completely unacceptable'.\\nThe former director of public prosecutions said he hoped those responsible for the violence were brought to justice.\\n'I hope that the perpetrators are identified and prosecuted where that's appropriate,' Sir Keir told LBC Radio.\\nDarren Jones, the Labour MP for Bristol North West, said: 'You don't campaign for the right to peaceful protest by setting police vans on fire or graffitiing buildings.'\\nBristol Mayor Marvin Rees said he was 'disgusted' with the violence on the streets of Bristol.\\n'We're disgusted at what happened in the city and absolutely condemn the actions of those people who brought violence and destruction to our city last night,' he said.\\n'It also points out the political illiteracy of those people on our streets doing this violence last night. What has injuring police officers, smashing windows, burning cars got to do with the challenges we face as a city right now?\\n'As we come out of Covid-19, we face economic depression, we have to secure jobs for people, tackle child hunger, build homes for people. It's got nothing to do with the struggles in this city and I wouldn't even mention these people in the same breath as the very legitimate debate that there is over this Bill.'\\nAppearing on Good Morning Britain today, he said: 'We're disgusted and I absolutely condemn what's gone on.\\n'I draw a hard line between those people out smashing up my city and the bill, they've got nothing to do with the bill, they're a group of people running around the country looking for any opportunity to enter into physical conflict with the police or representatives of what they see as the establishment whether it's the bill, whether it's some other protest they'll take the opportunity.'\\nHe added: 'What we had last night, there were many people who went out and made their voices heard but there were these group of people, irrespective of the issue they were out there to cause problems for whatever revolutionary fantasy they're playing at.\\n'We're not going to let them take away what we've built in recent years. It would be quite interesting in the mop up, not just to have these people arrested, but to see where they actually come from, because I imagine a few are not actually from this city, but are revolutionary tourists as it were.\\n'They are self-indulgent, selfish, self-centred, what they've done has nothing to do with the bill and in fact as everyone's been pointing out, it will be used as evidence by people who want to support the bill. They've no strategy, they've no connection to any real politics it's just taking the opportunity to express their emotions of whatever distorted source they have.\\n'Being a black man, I'm from a community that's disproportionately likely to end up on the wrong side of the criminal justice system and receive unfair treatment from the system, if they make the bill more likely, it does not bring me closer to justice, it pushes justice away. Myself, my brothers and sisters, people from traditionally poor communities, they've done nothing to support us, nothing in line with what we've done in the last few years to feed our children to house people who don't have homes, take care of people coming out of the criminal justice system.\\n'They haven't turned up for that, they've just turned up to smash up our city and that's unacceptable.'\\nA separate event for Reclaim the Streets\u00a0- who are protesting violence against women in the wake of Sarah Everard's death in London - also took place in Newcastle yesterday.\\nPictures show a large group gathering and a female protester being pinned to the ground by four police officers.\\nShe was told to move and when she refused, police responded by taking her to the floor, where she was handcuffed before being put in a van.\\nIn a video shot at the scene close to Grey's Monument in the city, the woman is visibly distressed and screaming as she is bundled into the back of the police vehicle.\\nIt is understood the woman was standing on her own when she was approached by the police more than an hour before it was set to start.\\nAndy Roebuck, chairman of the Avon and Somerset Police Federation, said: 'Disgusting scenes in Bristol by a mob of animals who are injuring police officers, members of the public and damaging property.\\nChief Superintendent Will White of Avon and Somerset Police said: 'What started out as a peaceful protest has been turned by a small minority into violent disorder.\\n'Officers have been subjected to considerable levels of abuse and violence. One suffered a broken arm and another suffered broken ribs. Both have been taken to hospital. At least two police vehicles have been set on fire and damage has been caused to the outside of the station.'\\nHe added: 'We have requested mutual aid from neighbouring forces to bring this incident to a safe conclusion.'\\nThis morning, a spokesperson for Avon and Somerset Police said: 'I can confirm seven arrests have been made overnight.\\n'We will now be carrying out a significant investigation to identify all those responsible. There were in region of 12 officers injured - with two taken to hospital with serious injuries. We will be carrying out high profile patrols today.'\\nBristol Mayor Marvin Rees added: 'Smashing buildings in our city centre, vandalising vehicles, attacking our police will do nothing to lessen the likelihood of the Bill going through.\\n'On the contrary, the lawlessness on show will be used as evidence and promote the need for the Bill. This is a shameful day in an incredible year for Bristol.'\\nHe warned: 'Being a black man, I'm from a community that's disproportionately likely to end up on the wrong side of the criminal justice system and receive unfair treatment from the system, if they make the bill more likely, it does not bring me closer to justice, it pushes justice away.'\\nHe added: 'The violence and damage that have emerged from the protests are unacceptable and have nothing to do with the real work we are doing to tackle political, economic and social inequality.\\n'I recognise the frustrations with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill.\\n'I have major concerns about the Bill myself, which is poorly thought-out and could impose disproportionate controls on free expression and the right to peaceful protest.\\n'It also misses as much as it includes, such as measures that could reduce violence against women and girls. We will raise our concerns.\\n'We have faced times of great confrontation, particularly surrounding Black Lives Matter and the events that followed. We have had numerous protests.\\n'Our police, city representatives and I have been able to point out with pride that we have faced these moments of conflict without the physical conflict that others have experienced.\\n'Those who decided to turn today's protest into a physical confrontation and smash our city have robbed us of this.\\n'What they have done has more to do with self-gratification than it has to do with the protection and advancement of those of us from communities most likely to be marginalised and mistreated by our political and legal systems.'\\nThangam Debbonaire, Labour MP for Bristol West and shadow secretary of state for housing, said: 'This is absolutely unacceptable.\\n'The scenes of violence and direct attack on the police in Bristol city centre will distress most people including anyone who believes in defending the right to peaceful democratic protest.'\\nJohn Apter, national chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: 'This is not about protecting the right to protest, it's violent criminality from a hardcore minority who will hijack any situation for their own aims.\\n'My colleagues, some of whom are now in hospital, face the brunt of that hatred. Thoughts remain with my colleagues.'\\nMr Roebuck later told the BBC: 'This is the worst violence in Bristol for many, many years. It's really unprecedented violence. Between four and six or possibly more officers are seriously injured and some have broken bones. No one had any indication it would erupt this way.'\\nThe Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, introduced to the Commons this month, would give officers in England and Wales more power to impose conditions on non-violent protests, including those deemed too noisy or a nuisance.\\nThose convicted under the proposed legislation could face a fine or jail. The Bristol protesters were carrying signs reading 'say no to UK police state' and 'freedom to protest is fundamental'.\\nPolice had advised people not to attend the protest due to coronavirus legislation, which bans mass gatherings.\\nHome Secretary Priti Patel tweeted Sunday evening: 'Unacceptable scenes in Bristol tonight. Thuggery and disorder by a minority will never be tolerated.\\n'My thoughts this evening are with those police officers injured.'\\nHundreds gathered in Bristol city centre to demonstrate against a controversial Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill which would give the police in England and Wales more power to impose conditions on non-violent protests, including those deemed too noisy or a nuisance.\\nThe demonstration, which begun on College Green, turned violent after protesters set a police van alight and threw fireworks and 'projectiles' towards officers.\\nPolice donned riot gear and brought in dogs and horses to control the growing crowds as tensions rose into the evening.\\nThe 'mob' then gathered around\u00a0Bridewell Police Station where protesters were filmed smashing through the building's windows with a baton and rocks. Police were seen protecting the station from the inside whilst filming perpetrators.\\nThose convicted under the proposed legislation could face a fine or jail.\u00a0Mass gatherings are currently banned under coronavirus legislation and anyone breaching the regulations could be fined.\\nProtesters carried placards with slogans such as 'The Day Democracy Became Dictatorship' and 'We Can't Be Silenced That Easy'.\\nAvon and Somerset Police had urged people not to attend the demonstration - warning that enforcement action could be taken.\\nThe man suspected of Miss Everard's murder is a police officer, and the case has unleashed an outpouring of grief and rage over the issue of violence against women and girls.\\nThe government bill pre-dated the Sarah Everard case and covers a wide range of policy areas as well as the policing of protests.\\nHowever, the two became connected in many people's minds because, by coincidence, the bill was up for debate in parliament two days after the London vigil.\\nFootage taken in Bristol city centre showed the moment protesters almost overturned a police van they had defaced with graffiti, before officers in riot gear pushed them back with batons.\\nIt also comes after dozens of people were arrested last night as police attempted to halt thousands of anti-lockdown protesters marching through the centre of London.\\nThe protests come after Home Secretary Priti Patel defended the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill in Parliament earlier this week.\\nSpeaking at the debate, on Monday night Ms Patel said peaceful protest was a 'cornerstone of democracy,' before adding: 'The current legislation police use to manage protests, the Public Order Act 1986, was enacted over 30 years ago.\\n'In recent years we've seen significant change in protest tactics, with protesters exploiting gaps in the law which have led to disproportionate amounts of disruption.\\nMs Patel said: 'Last year we saw XR (Extinction Rebellion) block the passage of an ambulance on emergency calls, gluing themselves to trains during rush hour, blocking airport runways, preventing hundreds of hard-working people from going to work.'\\nHowever, former prime minister Theresa May argued: 'Freedom of speech is an important right in our democracy, however annoying or uncomfortable sometimes that might be and I know there will be people who will have seen scenes of protest and will have said, 'why isn't the Government doing something?', to which the answer in many cases may simply be because we live in a democratic, free society.'\\nMs May added: 'It's tempting with the Home Secretary to think that giving powers to the Home Secretary is very reasonable because we all think we're reasonable, but actually future home secretaries may not be so reasonable and I wonder if the Government would be willing to publish a draft of those regulations during passage of the Bill so we can actually see what that is going to be and make sure that it is not also encroaching on the operational decisions of the police.\\n'So there are very important elements of this Bill, but I would urge the Government to consider carefully the need to walk a fine line between being popular and populist. Our freedoms depend on it.'\\nAs the bill was voted through, protesters had gathered outside the Palace of Westminster to rally against both the legislation and also the police.\\nAccording to the Labour MP Victims and Youth Justice Shadow Minister Peter Kyle, the bill committee has been 'pulled' and 'won't start until later in the year'.\\nA spokesperson for the Home Office told MailOnline that people should not currently be protesting due to lockdown laws. Blanket restrictions on protesting are due to be lifted later this month.\\nAt least nine cars had the windscreens smashed in and vandalised as a wave of violent protest hit Bristol last night.\\nAn angry mob had descended on Bridewell Police Station in the city centre to protest the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill to strengthen policing powers.\\nSome of the group, which called themselves 'Kill the Bill', were seen\u00a0smashing in windows and set police vehicles alight on Sunday.\\nThe violence also spread to the nearby Rupert Street car park where a whole line of cars had been smashed up one after the other.\\nIt has been reported that the cars belong to NHS workers, who often use the multi-storey facility while working at the nearby infirmary and children's hospital.\\nBy Dan Sales for MailOnline\\nA rogues' gallery of up to 500 people wanted in connection with the Kill the Bill riots in Bristol has been drawn up by police after their own force was besieged with scenes of violence.\\nDetectives are hunting what they believe to be is a 'hardcore of serious criminals' who infiltrated the 3,000 legitimate demonstrators protesting the bill.\\nAmong the thousands who massed at the city's College Green were members of anarchist groups as well as those hostile to law enforcement.\\nAnd with hours of CCTV, body-worn cameras and eyewitness videos posted online, investigators will be able to narrow down those who could help them with their enquiries.\\nThey will include those seen proudly posing above a burning police car in the city centre and celebrating in front of smouldering emergency vehicles.\\nPictures have also captured moments of clear criminal damage being carried out, such as street furniture or roadworks equipment being destroyed and people invading a police station.\\nAvon and Somerset Police's Chief Constable Andy Marsh said: 'This will undoubtedly lead to one of the biggest appeals for wanted suspects that we've ever done. There will be significant consequences for behaviour like this and we will leave no stone unturned'\\nThe protest was billed as being against the Government's Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which will see the police handed new powers to tackle demonstrations.\\nBut the rally turned sour as darkness began to fall as the pocket of criminals inside the demonstration began their work.\\nCurrently just\u00a0seven people have been arrested in connection with the violent scenes.\\nBut the\u00a0Avon and Somerset police and crime commissioner said 'many more' would be arrested in the coming days as officers examined footage.\\nTwenty police officers were injured, two seriously, when what started as a non-violent demonstration turned violent after hundreds of protesters descended on the New Bridewell police station.\\nTwo of these injured were treated in hospital after suffering broken ribs and an arm. Both have since been discharged.\\nMr Marsh said the demonstration had been 'hijacked' by several hundred 'extremists'.\\n'I believe the events of yesterday were hijacked by extremists, people who were determined to commit criminal damage, to generate very negative sentiment about policing and to assault our brave officers,' he said.", "image": [["Avon and Somerset police have condemned scenes which saw a police station come under siege during Sunday night's unrest", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/03/22/07/40773020-9388059-image-a-18_1616399859298.jpg"], ["'Kill The Bill' protesters were fighting with the police into the early hours of Monday morning after the day of violence in Bristol", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/03/22/09/40773728-9388059-image-a-44_1616404713571.jpg"], ["A row of at least nine cars with their windows smashed in the Rupert Street car park in Bristol.

This saw an 11% drop, pushing UK emissions down 51% over levels set in 1990. This brings the UK halfway to the goal of a 100% drop over 1991 levels by 2050. Study authors warn that the drop could reverse as lockdown measures are lifted.", "text": "A dramatic 11% drop in greenhouse gas emissions during the coronavirus lockdown has put the UK halfway towards its target of becoming 'net zero' by 2050.\\nClimate and energy website Carbon Brief estimated the 11% drop in greenhouse gas emissions last year, saying it was the biggest annual fall in at least 30 years.\\nHowever, emissions 'are likely to increase as the economy recovers,' the group behind the new study warned, suggesting the drop would be short lived.\\nThis highlights the challenge in 'cutting carbon in areas such as transport and housing' to meet the goal to end the UK's contribution to climate change by 2050.\\nThe Paris Agreement, which was first signed in 2015, is an international agreement to limit climate change.\\nIt hopes to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2\u00b0C (3.6\u00baF) 'and to pursue efforts to limit increases to 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F)'.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Paris Agreement on Climate Change has four main goals with regards to reducing emissions:\\nA long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\\nTo aim to limit the increase to 1.5\u00b0C, since this would significantly reduce risks and the impacts of climate change\\nGovernments agreed on the need for global emissions to peak as soon as possible, recognising that this will take longer for developing countries\\nTo undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with the best available science\\nSource: European Commission\\nCarbon Brief says the significant reduction in 2020 means the UK has seen emissions fall 51% since 1990 - the benchmark year for measuring reductions.\\nIn 1990 the UK\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions stood at 794m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent\u00a0and the UK has committed to drop 100% down to 'net zero' emissions based on 1990 levels.\\nBy\u00a0reducing emissions as much as possible and taking steps such as planting trees to offset any remaining pollution the country can meet the obligation, authors say.\\nLast year marked the halfway point in the 60-year period to achieve net zero.\\nThe analysis shows emissions were down more than half, from 794 million tonnes of greenhouse gases in 1990 to 389 million tonnes in 2020.\\nAlmost all of the fall in emissions between 1990 and up until 2019 had been due to major changes in just three areas, which together account for roughly 90% of the decline.\\nThese were electricity supplies that no longer rely on coal, cleaner industry, including manufacturing and waste industry emissions, as well as more efficient industrial processes and a structural shift away from carbon-intensive manufacturing.\\nThere was also a smaller and cleaner fossil fuel supply industry, with lower methane emissions from coal mines and leaky gas distribution pipes.\\nBut last year's falls, which helped push UK emission cuts past the halfway point, were largely the result of lockdown reducing car use and smaller industry.\\nWarmer than average weather also cut heating demand, analysts said.\\nThere was also a trend towards renewable electricity, with the UK producing more from renewable sources than fossil fuels for the first time in history.\\nEmissions will likely rise again in 2021 or 2022 as the economy recovers from the pandemic and people increasingly get back in their cars, Carbon Brief said.\\nIn 2020 around 60% of the annual reduction came from lower oil use, mostly a reduction in petrol and diesel sales as lockdown took hold, costing the Treasury around \u00a35 billion in lost fuel duty revenues, the analysis said.\\nWhile there may be an increase in home working after restrictions are lifted, that could be offset by nervousness over using public transport encouraging driving.\\nWhile electric vehicle sales now make up more than 10% of new cars, they only account for 1% of cars on the road, with a negligible impact on transport emissions which have dropped little in the 30 years since 1990.\\nBut the analysis also shows the UK's power sector has transformed in 30 years.\\nIn 1990, two-thirds of electricity came from coal, 10% from oil and just 2% from renewables, but by 2020 the UK was generating more power from wind, solar, biomass and hydro than fossil fuels in 2020, with nearly half of days coal-free.\\nIndustry has also cleaned up its act, with controls on landfill methane and other greenhouse gases, and more efficient industrial processes.\\nCarbon Brief say there has also been a structural shift away from carbon-intensive manufacturing in the British Isles which has contributed to reduced emissions.\\nThe climate emergency is 'a situation in which urgent action is required to reduce or halt climate change and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from it', as defined by\u00a0Oxford Dictionaries.\\nThe term was declared the 'word of the year' by Oxford Dictionaries after its usage soared by over 10,000 per cent in 2019.\\nThe UK declared a climate emergency for the national government and devolved administrations of Scotland and Wales in May 2019.\\nIt was largely a symbolic move in recognition of urgency needed to combat the climate crisis.\\nThe motion did not change the government\u2019s legally binding targets under international accords.\\nThere is also a smaller and cleaner fossil fuel supply industry with lower emissions from coal mines and leaky gas distribution pipes, Carbon Brief said.\\nEmissions of carbon dioxide, which makes up the lion's share of greenhouse gas pollution, are now at their lowest level since 1879, the analysis shows.\\nPer person, UK greenhouse gas emissions are now as low as they were in 1853, and are roughly in line with the global average, making them lower than for each person in the US or China, though still three times that of India.\\nChris Stark, chief executive of the UK's advisory Climate Change Committee, said getting halfway to net zero is a story to celebrate.\\nStark added that this shows the UK has outperformed many other similar economies.\\nHe said there now needs to be a shift in focus from cleaner and greener electricity generation, which accounted for much of the progress to date.\\n'Getting to net zero by 2050 means investing in zero-carbon replacements for the high-carbon assets we use every day. Our cars and vans, our gas boilers, plants and machinery in industry,' he said.\\nBefore the UK hosts international climate talks in Glasgow in November, ambitious plans are needed to decarbonise transport, make buildings less draughty, clean up industry and change how land is used, he said.\\nBut Greenpeace UK's head of climate Kate Blagojevic warned the findings are not a cause for celebration as the UK is still a long way from reaching its commitments.\\nShe said: 'Make no mistake, the scale of necessary future emission cuts are far greater than anything that has been managed during the pandemic.\\n'We need much more Government funding, policies and political will to cut emissions from our homes, cars, industry and agriculture if we are to meet our climate targets once normal life resumes.'\\nCarbon Brief's estimates of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 are based on analysis of provisional energy use published by the UK government last month.\\nThey cover domestic emissions but not those associated with imported goods or international aviation or shipping.\\nThe findings have been published on the Carbon Brief website.\\nEmissions\\nCarbon dioxide\\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the biggest contributors to global warming. After the gas is released into the atmosphere it stays there, making it difficult for heat to escape - and warming up the planet in the process.\\nIt is primarily released from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, as well as cement production.\\nThe average monthly concentration of CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere, as of April 2019, is 413 parts per million (ppm). Before the Industrial Revolution, the concentration was just 280 ppm.\\nCO2 concentration has fluctuated over the last 800,000 years between 180 to 280ppm, but has been vastly accelerated by pollution caused by humans.\\nNitrogen dioxide\\nThe gas nitrogen dioxide (NO2) comes from burning fossil fuels, car exhaust emissions and the use of nitrogen-based fertilisers used in agriculture.\\nAlthough there is far less NO2 in the atmosphere than CO2, it is between 200 and 300 times more effective at trapping heat.\\nSulfur dioxide\\nSulfur dioxide (SO2) also primarily comes from fossil fuel burning, but can also be released from car exhausts.\\nSO2 can react with water, oxygen and other chemicals in the atmosphere to cause acid rain.\\nCarbon monoxide\\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is an indirect greenhouse gas as it reacts with\u00a0hydroxyl radicals, removing them. Hydroxyl radicals reduce the lifetime of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.\\nParticulates\\nWhat is particulate matter?\\nParticulate matter refers to tiny parts of solids or liquid materials in the air.\\nSome are visible, such as dust, whereas others cannot be seen by the naked eye.\\nMaterials such as metals, microplastics, soil and chemicals can be in particulate matter.\\nParticulate matter (or PM) is described in micrometres. The two main ones mentioned in reports and studies are PM10 (less than 10 micrometres) and PM2.5 (less than 2.5 micrometres).\\nScientists measure the rate of particulates in the air by cubic metre.\\nParticulate matter is sent into the air by a number of processes including burning fossil fuels, driving cars and steel making.\\nWhy are particulates dangerous?\\nParticulates are dangerous because those less than 10 micrometres in diameter can get deep into your lungs, or even pass into your bloodstream. Particulates are found in higher concentrations in urban areas, particularly along main roads.\\nHealth impact\\nWhat sort of health problems can pollution cause?\\nAccording to the World Health Organization, a third of deaths from stroke, lung cancer and heart disease can be linked to air pollution.\\nSome of the effects of air pollution on the body are not understood, but pollution may increase inflammation which narrows the arteries leading to heart attacks or strokes.\\nAs well as this, almost one in 10 lung cancer cases in the UK are caused by air pollution.\\nParticulates find their way into the lungs and get lodged there, causing inflammation and damage. As well as this, some chemicals in particulates that make their way into the body can cause cancer.\\nDeaths from pollution\\nAround seven million people die prematurely because of air pollution every year. Pollution can cause a number of issues including asthma attacks, strokes, various cancers and cardiovascular problems.\\nAsthma triggers\\nAir pollution can cause problems for asthma sufferers for a number of reasons. Pollutants in traffic fumes can irritate the airways, and particulates can get into your lungs and throat and make these areas inflamed.\\nProblems in pregnancy\\nWomen exposed to air pollution before getting pregnant are nearly 20 per cent more likely to have babies with birth defects, research suggested in January 2018.\\nLiving within 3.1 miles (5km) of a highly-polluted area one month before conceiving makes women more likely to give birth to babies with defects such as cleft palates or lips, a study by\u00a0University of Cincinnati found.\\nFor every 0.01mg/m3 increase in fine air particles, birth defects rise by 19 per cent, the research adds.\\nPrevious research suggests this causes birth defects as a result of women suffering inflammation and 'internal stress'.\\nWhat is being done to tackle air pollution?\\nParis agreement on climate change\\nThe Paris Agreement, which was first signed in 2015, is an international agreement to control and limit climate change.\\nIt hopes to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2\u00b0C (3.6\u00baF) 'and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F)'.\\nCarbon neutral by 2050\\nThe UK government has announced plans to make the country carbon neutral by 2050.\\nThey plan to do this by planting more trees and by installing 'carbon capture' technology at the source of the pollution.\\nSome critics are worried that this first option will be used by the government to export its carbon offsetting to other countries.\\nInternational carbon credits let nations\u00a0continue emitting carbon while paying for trees to be planted elsewhere, balancing out their emissions.\\nNo new petrol or diesel vehicles by 2040\\nIn 2017, the UK government announced the sale of new petrol and diesel cars would be banned by 2040.\\nHowever,\u00a0\u00a0MPs on the climate change committee have urged the government to bring the ban forward to 2030, as by then they will have an equivalent range and price.\\nNorway's electric car subsidies\\nThe speedy electrification of Norway's automotive fleet is attributed mainly to generous state subsidies.\u00a0Electric cars are almost entirely exempt from the heavy taxes imposed on petrol and diesel cars, which makes them competitively priced.\\nA VW Golf with a standard combustion engine costs nearly 334,000 kroner (34,500 euros, $38,600), while its electric cousin the e-Golf costs 326,000 kroner thanks to a lower tax quotient.\\nCriticisms of inaction on climate change\\nThe Committee on Climate Change (CCC) has said there is a 'shocking' lack of Government preparation for the risks to the country from climate change.\\nThe committee assessed 33 areas where the risks of climate change had to be addressed \u2013 from flood resilience of properties to impacts on farmland and supply chains \u2013 and found no real progress in any of them.\\nThe UK is not prepared for 2\u00b0C of warming, the level at which countries have pledged to curb temperature rises, let alone a 4\u00b0C rise, which is possible if greenhouse gases are not cut globally, the committee said.\\nIt added that cities need more green spaces to stop the urban 'heat island' effect, and to prevent floods by soaking up heavy rainfall.", "image": [["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/03/18/14/40638760-9374811-image-m-13_1616079127967.jpg"], ["Car traffic fell by more than a quarter through lockdown with all other traffic seeing some degree of reduction, further reducing emissions", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/03/18/14/40637208-9374811-image-a-42_1616077208432.jpg"], ["Overall greenhouse gas emissions fell by their lowest rate for at least 30 years in 2020 -

E-mail: tips@dailymail.com.", "text": "E-mail: tips@dailymail.com\\nA rogues' gallery of up to 500 people wanted in connection with the Kill the Bill riots in Bristol has been drawn up by police after their own force was besieged by violent protests - as professional anarchists' links to the riot have emerged.\\nDetectives are hunting what they believe to be a 'hardcore of serious criminals' who infiltrated 3,000 legitimate demonstrators protesting the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill on Sunday.\\nAmong the thousands who massed at the city's College Green were members of known anarchist groups, and those hostile to law enforcement.\\nAnd with hours of CCTV, body-worn police camera footage and eyewitness videos posted online to pore over, investigators will be working to identify activists who could help them with their enquiries.\\nThey will include those seen proudly posing above a burning police car in the city centre and celebrating in front of smouldering emergency vehicles.\\nPictures have also captured moments of clear criminal damage being carried out, such as street furniture or roadworks equipment being destroyed and people invading a police station.\\nSeven arrests have been made since yesterday's ugly scenes that left 20 police injured - with one officer seriously wounded with a collapsed lung in hospital after being stamped on in the melee.\\nThe local Bridewell police station was also trashed, 12 police vans were set on fire or damaged, windows were smashed with graffiti sprayed across walls and buidlings.\\nAvon and Somerset Police's Chief Constable Andy Marsh said: 'This will undoubtedly lead to one of the biggest appeals for wanted suspects that we've ever done. There will be significant consequences for behaviour like this and we will leave no stone unturned'\\nThe protest was billed as being against the Government's Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which will see the police handed new powers to tackle demonstrations.\\nBut the rally turned sour as darkness began to fall as the pocket of criminals inside the demonstration began their work.\\nGroups understood to be at the march included Sisters Uncut,\u00a0who already organised Kill the Bill marches in cities around the country, as well as regional anarchist organisations.\\nMembers of the Bristol Anarchist Federation were also there, with one member seemingly blaming the police for what happened.\\nProfessional anarchists including one dubbed 'the most dangerous man in Britain' stirred up the Bristol protests into the city's shameful night of violence.\\nThe perfect storm of protesters, anarchists and troublemakers combined to create disgraceful scenes that saw police attacked and 999 vehicles set ablaze.\\nLast night Sisters Uncut, who already organised Kill the Bill marches in cities around the country, hailed the action in Bristol.\\nShowing a picture of the demonstrations, they declared: 'In Bristol, thousands attended a protest in defiance of the government's plan to give the police more powers. Thousands said: #KillTheBill!'\\nThe post online coincided exactly with the separate approval of veteran agitator Ian Bone, best known for harassing MP Jacob Rees-Mogg's children outside their home in a protest.\\nOn March 16 he had shared a placard which read 'F*** the police' in huge white letters, with the smaller text below 'Crime, sentencing and courts bill'.\\nThe next day he retweeted the date and time for the protest in Bristol, together with the meeting place.\\n\\nSisters Uncut was formed in 2014 by activists Janelle Brown and Vicky Ford to support victims of domestic violence, and found fame for stunts including jumping on the red carpet at the West End premiere of the movie 'Suffragette'.\\nSisters Uncut say the police are institutionally violent against women and cannot be trusted with women's safety.\\nSisters Uncut has been backed by BLM UK and Extinction Rebellion, who were behind the most high profile protests in Britain over the past few years.\\nThe Bristol Anarchist Federation was also involved in the protests.\\nOn the eve of the gathering they Tweeted: 'Tomorrow, let's #killthebill Bristol!'\\nThey then joked about a picture of a skateboarder in front of a burning emergency vehicle: 'When you do a trick so sick that a police van bursts into flame.'\\nHe wrote on a blog: 'When the police took the gloves off and really struck out the people struck back.\\n'Batons, pepper spray and shields were met with fists and sticks.\\n'The police vans that drove into the crowd were attacked with bottles and spray paint.'\\nVeteran anarchist Ian Bone also appeared delighted with the fire and fight unfolding in the city.\\nIt is unknown whether he was in Bristol himself, or at his south London home, but Tweeted gleefully: 'All hail the Bristol uprising'. It came just five days after he posted a message under his 'Class War' group branding, which predominantly featured the words 'F*** the police'.\\nCurrently just\u00a0seven people have been arrested in connection with the violent scenes.\\nBut the\u00a0Avon and Somerset police and crime commissioner said 'many more' would be arrested in the coming days as officers examined footage.\\nTwenty police officers were injured, two seriously, when what started as a non-violent demonstration turned violent after hundreds of protesters descended on the New Bridewell police station.\\nTwo of these injured were treated in hospital after suffering broken ribs and an arm. Both have since been discharged.\\nMr Marsh said the demonstration had been 'hijacked' by several hundred 'extremists'.\\n'I believe the events of yesterday were hijacked by extremists, people who were determined to commit criminal damage, to generate very negative sentiment about policing and to assault our brave officers,' he said.\\n'Officers were very patient. From the initial gathering of around 2,000 to 3,000, which was more than we anticipated, there were about 50 officers engaging with those present and encouraging them to disperse.\\n'Many were complying, in fairness.\\n'There was a hardcore of serious criminals hidden within those 3,000 people - perhaps 400 or 500 people - and we certainly didn't trigger this.\\nBristol mayor Marvin Rees, who said he had 'major concerns' about the Government's Bill, condemned the thuggery but said the disorder would be used to justify the legislation.\\n'It's selfish, it is self-indulgent and self-centred activity - people living out their revolutionary fantasies,' he said.\\n'This has nothing to do with being in lockdown for a year. What has injuring police officers, smashing windows, burning cars got to do with the challenges we face as a city right now?\\n'But the violence that happened last night goes nowhere to actually reducing the likelihood of this Bill winning support. In fact it does quite the contrary.\\n'People from those communities who have been on the rough end of the criminal justice system are now in more danger. It doesn't put them closer to justice, it puts them further away.\\nThe Government's Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill\u00a0 could see the police handed more powers to tackle demonstrations.\\nThe wide-ranging proposals include laws to reform sentencing, the courts and handling offenders.\\nIf passed, some of the measures will be UK-wide while others may only apply in England and Wales. They include:\\n- Whole life orders for premeditated murder of a child, allowing judges to also hand out the maximum sentence to 18 to 20-year-olds in exceptional cases, like for acts of terrorism leading to mass loss of life.\\n- The legislation looks to toughen up powers the police have to tackle 'non-violent' protests which are significantly disruptive to the public or on access to Parliament.\\n- The proposed law includes an offence of 'intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance'.\\nAccording to the Bill, someone commits this crime if they cause 'serious harm to the public', which can include 'serious annoyance, serious inconvenience or serious loss of amenity'. Those convicted could face a fine or jail.\\nMeanwhile, the Government is also seeking to increase the maximum penalty for criminal damage to a memorial from three months to 10 years, under the Bill.\\nThe laws could also see police have more powers to crack down on unauthorised encampments which interfere with the ability to use the land.\\nOfficers could also be allowed to stop and search people more if plans for serious violence reduction orders go ahead.\\nThis would make it easier to carry out checks on those who have previously been convicted of carrying a knife.\\n\\n'It runs absolutely against what they claim to be fighting for - political illiteracy at large.'\\nSue Mountstevens, police and crime commissioner for Avon and Somerset, said further arrests would be made.\\n'It's disgraceful and outrageous. Police officers went to work yesterday, and some have returned home via hospital battered and bruised,' she said.\\n'The officers were incredibly patient, incredibly professional and I pay tribute to them.'\\nMr Marsh said 12 police vehicles were damaged, including two that were set on fire, and 'significant damage' was caused to the New Bridewell police station.\\n'I'm incredibly saddened by the dreadful scenes we saw here,' he said.\\n'Officers were pelted with stones and missiles and fireworks and it was a terrifying situation for them to deal with.\\n'We have 20 officers injured, two of them seriously, and I spoke to one of them in hospital.\\n'Thankfully both officers have been released from hospital and are with their families.\\n'All of those assaulted were incredibly shocked, some of them were beaten around the head with sticks, hit with missiles.'\\nHome Secretary Priti Patel described the scenes as unacceptable and said 'thuggery and disorder' would never be tolerated.\\nSue Mountstevens, police and crime commissioner for Avon and Somerset, said seven people had been arrested so far and there would be 'many more' detained.\\n'It's disgraceful and outrageous. Police officers went to work yesterday, and some have returned home via hospital battered and bruised,' she said.\\n'There will be warrants, there will be arrests and police will be checking on the CCTV. There will be further arrests in the next few hours and days.\\n'I believe there have been seven arrests so far and there will be many more.'\\nThe Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill would give the police in England and Wales more power to impose conditions on non-violent protests, including those deemed too noisy or a nuisance.\\nThose convicted under the proposed legislation could face a fine or jail.\\nAvon and Somerset Police Federation chairman Andy Roebuck condemned the violence as 'disgusting scenes in Bristol by a mob of animals'.\\nJohn Apter, the national chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: 'This is not about protecting the right to protest, it's violent criminality from a hardcore minority who will hijack any situation for their own aims.'\\nDarren Jones, the Labour MP for Bristol North West, said: 'You don't campaign for the right to peaceful protest by setting police vans on fire or graffitiing buildings.'\\nVeteran activist and grandfather Ian Bone, 71, was once dubbed Britain's most dangerous man after the Class War newspaper he launched in 1982 became so incendiary it featured pictures of beaten up policemen.\\nHis father was butler to Sir Gerald Coke, grandson of the Earl of Leicester, and the family lived in a bonded cottage on a family estate in Hampshire.\\nYoung Ian hated the rich children 'from the big house' for calling his father 'Bone' and grew up with an abiding contempt for the upper classes.\\nAfter finishing a degree in politics from Swansea University, he announced to his horrified parents that his choice of 'career' was to be an anarchist, and that he would fund it by claiming the dole.\\nThe full-time anarchist \u2013 who's been on state benefits since leaving university \u2013 now walks with a stick due to Parkinson's disease.\\n\\nBone has been protesting since the 1980s and is a publisher with class activist publications, Class War and The Bristolian.\u00a0He became a founding member of Class War, a group dedicated to the violent overthrow of state structures, and published newspapers in support of the cause.\\nAt its height it sold 15,000 copies weekly and supported striking miners, dockers, print workers and demos including the Brixton Riots of 1981, before the publication was launched.\\nBone went on Bash the Rich marches (Bash the Rich is also the title of his autobiography). Just a decade ago he advocated violence to overthrow the state.\\nWhile still a weekly paper, Class War dubbed itself 'Britain's most unruly tabloid'.\\nAfter Prince William's birth in September 1984 it carried a front page picture of him with the headline 'Another f***ing royal parasite'.\\nAnother front page carried an image of Margaret Thatcher with a hatchet buried in her head. When the paper folded, it carried on as a pressure group.\\nHe lived in Grenfell from 1983-1986 and knew several residents who were caught up in the fire there where 72 people died.\\nHe went on to protest outside The Shard when Grenfell residents weren't being re-housed because there were 10 \u00a350m empty luxury flats inside the state-of-the-art tower. Bone was taken to the High Court by Qatari royal family, owner of The Shard, in February 2018 to stop his protests before their lawyers withdrew their threat of an injunction against him.\\nIn 2006 he told The Guardian newspaper that violence was key, saying: 'Not (attacking someone) individually, but if you're fighting back as a mob against a particular thing like the poll tax or the Iraq War (then) yes.. If the rich or the ruling class or the police are defending their interests, they deserve everything that's coming to them.'\\nWhen Baroness Thatcher died in 2013, he used his blog to summon an army of followers to celebratory street parties, and published an image of the former prime minister's head being cut open with a meat cleaver. Next to the image he wrote: 'The best cut of all.'\\nIn other film clips posted on YouTube, he rails against the Royal Family and urges 'violent action' to achieve his aims.\\nIn 2015 Bone posted pictures of himself angrily brandishing a walking stick during a protest against the so-called gentrification of London.\\nHe was the key figure behind a mob attack when riot police and helicopters were deployed after more than a thousand people descended on East London to protest against a trendy cafe selling breakfast cereals from around the world for up to \u00a34.40 a bowl.\\nAnd in June 2018 he posted on his own Facebook page in regards to Donald Trump's visit: 'Spend the day idling and drinking around Bond Street/ New Bond street...\u2026\u2026..enter shops......handle the goods....be insolent to the rich... insolence comrades...let insolence win the day.'\\nAfter his unabashed assault on the Rees-Mogg family in 2018, the father-of-five remained silent about his own family.\\n", "image": [["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/03/22/15/40782858-9388635-Some_of_the_protesters_proudly_posed_above_a_burning_police_car_-m-17_1616427992471.jpg"], ["Some of the

One suffered a broken arm and another suffered broken ribs. Both have been taken to hospital. At least two police vehicles have been set on fire and damage has been caused to the outside of the station.'\\nHe added: 'We have requested mutual aid from neighbouring forces to bring this incident to a safe conclusion.'\\nBristol Mayor Marvin Rees condemned the violence which has marred a protest about the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill.\\n'Smashing buildings in our city centre, vandalising vehicles, attacking our police will do nothing to lessen the likelihood of the Bill going through,' he said.\\n'On the contrary, the lawlessness on show will be used as evidence and promote the need for the Bill.\\n'This is a shameful day in an incredible year for Bristol.'\\nHe added: 'The violence and damage that have emerged from today's protests are unacceptable and have nothing to do with the real work we are doing to tackle political, economic and social inequality.\\n'I recognise the frustrations with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill.\\n'I have major concerns about the Bill myself, which is poorly thought-out and could impose disproportionate controls on free expression and the right to peaceful protest.\\n'It also misses as much as it includes, such as measures that could reduce violence against women and girls. We will raise our concerns.\\n\\n'We have faced times of great confrontation, particularly surrounding Black Lives Matter and the events that followed. We have had numerous protests.\\n'Our police, city representatives and I have been able to point out with pride that we have faced these moments of conflict without the physical conflict that others have experienced.\\n'Those who decided to turn today's protest into a physical confrontation and smash our city have robbed us of this.\\n'What they have done has more to do with self-gratification than it has to do with the protection and advancement of those of us from communities most likely to be marginalised and mistreated by our political and legal systems.'\\nThangam Debbonaire, Labour MP for Bristol West and shadow secretary of state for housing, said: 'This is absolutely unacceptable.\\n'The scenes of violence and direct attack on the police in Bristol city centre will distress most people including anyone who believes in defending the right to peaceful democratic protest.'\\nJohn Apter, national chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: 'This is not about protecting the right to protest, it's violent criminality from a hardcore minority who will hijack any situation for their own aims.\\n'My colleagues, some of whom are now in hospital, face the brunt of that hatred. Thoughts remain with my colleagues.'\\nA spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police tweeted: 'Officers have had projectiles thrown at them, including a firework, and have been verbally abused. This is unacceptable behaviour and those responsible for offences will be identified and brought to justice.'\\nMr Roebuck later told the BBC: 'This is the worst violence in Bristol for many, many years. It's really unprecedented violence. Between four and six or possibly more officers are seriously injured and some have broken bones. No one had any indication it would erupt this way.'\\nThe Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, introduced to the Commons this month, would give officers in England and Wales more power to impose conditions on non-violent protests, including those deemed too noisy or a nuisance.\\nThose convicted under the proposed legislation could face a fine or jail. The Bristol protesters were carrying signs reading 'say no to UK police state' and 'freedom to protest is fundamental'.\\nPolice had advised people not to attend the protest due to coronavirus legislation, which bans mass gatherings.\\nHome Secretary Priti Patel tweeted Sunday evening: 'Unacceptable scenes in Bristol tonight. Thuggery and disorder by a minority will never be tolerated.\\n'My thoughts this evening are with those police officers injured.'\\nHundreds gathered in Bristol city centre to demonstrate against a controversial Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill which would give the police in England and Wales more power to impose conditions on non-violent protests, including those deemed too noisy or a nuisance.\\nThe demonstration, which begun on College Green, turned violent after protesters set a police van alight and threw fireworks and 'projectiles' towards officers.\\nPolice donned riot gear and brought in dogs and horses to control the growing crowds as tensions rose into the evening.\\nThe 'mob' then gathered around\u00a0Bridewell Police Station where protesters were filmed smashing through the building's windows with a baton and rocks. Police were seen protecting the station from the inside whilst filming perpetrators.\\nThose convicted under the proposed legislation could face a fine or jail.\u00a0Mass gatherings are currently banned under coronavirus legislation and anyone breaching the regulations could be fined.\\nProtesters carried placards with slogans such as 'The Day Democracy Became Dictatorship' and 'We Can't Be Silenced That Easy'.\\nA spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police tweeted: 'Officers have had projectiles thrown at them, including a firework, and have been verbally abused. This is unacceptable behaviour and those responsible for offences will be identified and brought to justice.'\\nAvon and Somerset Police had urged people not to attend the demonstration - warning that enforcement action could be taken.\\nThe government's Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts bill, currently going through parliament, would give police new powers to impose time and noise limits on street protests.\\nThat has angered activists, particularly since a heavy-handed police response to a London vigil for murder victim Sarah Everard on March 13 caused widespread outrage and criticism of the police.\\nThe man suspected of Everard's murder is a police officer, and the case has unleashed an outpouring of grief and rage over the issue of violence against women and girls.\\nThe government bill pre-dated the Everard case and covers a wide range of policy areas as well as the policing of protests. However, the two became connected in many people's minds because, by coincidence, the bill was up for debate in parliament two days after the London vigil.\\nFootage taken in Bristol city centre showed the moment protesters almost overturned a police van they had defaced with graffiti, before officers in riot gear pushed them back with batons.\\nEarlier today a spokesman for the force said: 'Officers are engaging with a number of people who've turned up at the protest. We'd like to thank those who've agreed to leave for their understanding of why it's still important to follow Covid-19 restrictions and protect all our communities from this virus.'\\nA separate event for Reclaim the Streets\u00a0- who are protesting violence against women in the wake of Sarah Everard's death in London - took place in Newcastle.\\nPictures show a large group gathering and a female protester being pinned to the ground by four police officers.\\nShe was told to move and when she refused, police responded by taking her to the floor, where she was handcuffed before being put in a van.\\nIn a video shot at the scene close to Grey's Monument in the city, the woman is visibly distressed and screaming as she is bundled into the back of the police vehicle.\\nIt is understood the woman was standing on her own when she was approached by the police more than an hour before it was set to start.\\nIt also comes after dozens of people were arrested last night as police attempted to halt thousands of anti-lockdown protesters marching through the centre of London.\\nThe protests come after Home Secretary Priti Patel defended the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill in Parliament earlier this week.\\nHowever MPs including Theresa May raised concerns over the impact it will have on freedom of speech.\\nThe bill will see new powers given to the police and Home Secretary to deal with protests that are deemed to have caused 'serious unease, alarm or distress'.\\nIt will also raise the maximum sentence for defacing statues to 10 years, while new measures are also expected to crack down on knife crime.\\nThe bill has garnered controversy, particularly after Met Police officers were seen restraining women attending a vigil in memory of Sarah Everard in Clapham Common last month.\\nThe bill will mean that home secretaries will be able to create laws to define what 'serious disruption,' to communities and organisations means.\\nSpeaking at the debate, on Monday night Ms Patel said peaceful protest was a 'cornerstone of democracy,' before adding: 'The current legislation police use to manage protests, the Public Order Act 1986, was enacted over 30 years ago.\\n'In recent years we've seen significant change in protest tactics, with protesters exploiting gaps in the law which have led to disproportionate amounts of disruption.\\nMs Patel said: 'Last year we saw XR (Extinction Rebellion) block the passage of an ambulance on emergency calls, gluing themselves to trains during rush hour, blocking airport runways, preventing hundreds of hard-working people from going to work.'\\nHowever, former prime minister Theresa May argued: 'Freedom of speech is an important right in our democracy, however annoying or uncomfortable sometimes that might be and I know there will be people who will have seen scenes of protest and will have said, 'why isn't the Government doing something?', to which the answer in many cases may simply be because we live in a democratic, free society.'\\nMs May added: 'It's tempting with the Home Secretary to think that giving powers to the Home Secretary is very reasonable because we all think we're reasonable, but actually future home secretaries may not be so reasonable and I wonder if the Government would be willing to publish a draft of those regulations during passage of the Bill so we can actually see what that is going to be and make sure that it is not also encroaching on the operational decisions of the police.\\n'So there are very important elements of this Bill, but I would urge the Government to consider carefully the need to walk a fine line between being popular and populist. Our freedoms depend on it.'\\nThe bill passed its second reading earlier this week, despite Labour voting against it.\\nMPs voted 359 to 263, a majority of 96, at second reading, the first significant Commons test of a bill.\\nAs the bill was voted through, protesters had gathered outside the Palace of Westminster to rally against both the legislation and also the police.\\nBut it has been reported by\u00a0Cambridgeshire Live that it has since been delayed.\\nAccording to the Labour MP Victims and Youth Justice Shadow Minister Peter Kyle, the bill committee has been 'pulled' and 'won't start until later in the year'.\\nThe Policing Bill was part of the Conservative 2019 manifesto but elements raised eyebrows from MPs on the party's libertarian wing.\\nThe draft legislation includes an offence of 'intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance', and someone will be judged to have committed this crime if they cause 'serious harm to the public', which can include 'serious annoyance, serious inconvenience or serious loss of amenity', with those convicted potentially facing a fine or jail.\\nThe 'serious annoyance' element of the criteria has prompted a furious backlash from critics who warn the laws could pose a threat to free speech rights and the right to protest.\\nLabour voted against the bill, and shortly after the vote Sir Keir Starmer railed against it in a Twitter video, branding the Government's priorities 'completely wrong'.\\nHe said: 'The Conservatives have just voted for legislation to increase prison sentences for those damaging statues. But does nothing to address violence towards women and girls.'\\nA spokesperson for the Home Office told MailOnline that people should not currently be protesting due to lockdown laws. Blanket restrictions on protesting are due to be lifted later this month.", "image": [["Rioters set police vehicles on fire as protesters clashed with officers in the shocking scenes on Sunday night",
