She said people walking or cycling could get past and Extinction Rebellion protest organisers allowed some vehicles to go through, before police blocked the entrance completely to protect the safety of those sitting there.\\nDistrict Judge Matthews said in her ruling that she agreed with the police's actions and not with Parfitt's claim that the road was only partially blocked.\\nThe judge said it 'would have been madness' if the police had allowed motorists and lorry drivers to try to squeeze past the two sitting women.\\nThree police officers and the MoD's head of security were all called to give evidence by the prosecution during the morning of the one-day trial to confirm that the road had been blocked.\\nIn the afternoon, Parfitt laid out her defence that her actions were permitted under Sections 9, 10, 11 and 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights - that it was her right to protest in that way.\\nShe also said that, since her Christian faith compelled her to act on behalf of others, it was her right to religious freedom to highlight the climate crisis.\\nWith an alternative defence, Parfitt added that she had the right to try to prevent the further 'evil' of the continuing climate crisis, and that justified her protest.\\nParfitt told the court: 'Nothing can describe the horror that some people are facing in this world as a result of climate change.\\n'On December 11, I was trying to prevent further untold harm before it is absolutely too late.'\\nThe protest took place just after the Government announced a \u00a324billion funding boost for the Ministry of Defence - twice what it was allocating to be spent tackling the climate crisis.\\nAnd it came on the eve of the fifth anniversary of Paris Climate Accord, at which the UK Government agreed to do everything it could to limit global warming to just 1.5C.\\nParfitt also said the action was specifically targeted at the Ministry of Defence as it is one of the Government's major contributors to carbon emissions, but has been left out of Government carbon emission statistics and targets.\\nDistrict Judge Matthews said that she agreed the highway is a shared space and not just for motor vehicles, and therefore blocking it as a form of protest can be legitimate.\\nBut in a detailed judgment, she said on balance that Parfitt's human rights to protest 'did not trump the rights of others' to go to work unhindered.\\nThe court heard that normally, pre-Covid, there would have been as many as 9,000 people whose route to work at MoD Abbey Wood was blocked.\\nOn that day, during the December restrictions, only between 150 and 200 people were actually required in the office, plus contractors, builders and deliveries.\\nIn her judgment, District Judge Matthews said her role wasn't to pass judgment on the severity of the climate crisis.\\nShe said: 'Courts are strict arbiters of the law, therefore I do not adjudicate on anything else. I express no view on climate change.'\\nDistrict Judge Matthews added she had read and digested the most recent Supreme Court ruling on what has become known as the Ziegler case, after one of the four protesters eventually cleared last week of blocking the road outside the ExCel Centre, but said there were key differences with Parfitt's case.\\nOne was the difference between what was 'effectively a market of arms' event at the ExCel Centre, and the Ministry of Defence's Abbey Wood headquarters, and the fact that the people disrupted and blocked in Bristol were just trying to go to work.\\nShe did accept that the MoD offices were 'a legitimate target for Extinction Rebellion', but said that blocking the road was dealt with fairly by the police that morning.\\nParfitt was found guilty of obstruction of the highway. She\u00a0was fined \u00a3250 and ordered to pay \u00a3500.\\nShe was also sentenced for a similar offence last August in which she blocked the road during an Extinction Rebellion protest in Parliament Square, London.\\nThat case was moved from London to Bristol after one hearing in the capital where Parfitt glued her hand to the desk in the court in protest at her conviction.\\nShe was again fined \u00a3250 with \u00a3500 costs for the August offence, plus a \u00a350 surcharge, making her total bill across both cases \u00a31,550.\\nParfitt said she was compelled by her Christian faith to continue to protest to raise awareness of the climate emergency 'until my body is no longer strong enough', and indicated she intended to appeal against the conviction.\\nAfter the case, a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion said: 'This case should also be seen in the context of the recent Supreme Court ruling that blocking roads can be a lawful way to demonstrate, and that there should be a degree of tolerance to disruption caused by the right to protest when the action is over 'very important issues'.\\n'Sue Parfitt's protest outside the entrance of the MoD, representing one morning's obstruction and small inconvenience, has to be set alongside continuing government inaction, 365 days a year, that is contributing to the further destruction of the planet.'\\nLast Friday, the Supreme Court ruled that four defendants did have a right to protest by blocking a road, with a majority decision that was hailed as an affirmation of the right to protest with the kind of disruption caused by blocking roads.\\nIn that majority ruling, Lord Hamblen and Lord Stephens said: 'There should be a certain degree of tolerance to disruption to ordinary life, including disruption of traffic, caused by the exercise of the right to freedom of expression or freedom of peaceful assembly.'", "image": [["Reverend Sue Parfitt, 79, pictured sat in a camping chair in front of Ministry of Defence (MoD) Abbey Wood in Filton, Gloucestershire, during a protest on December 11 last year", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/01/11/44908029-9744937-image-m-15_1625136934249.jpg"], ["Police officers pictured speaking to Parfitt during last year's protest in Gloucestershire.\u00a0The court heard that Parfitt was one of around 20 climate change protesters who blockaded three entrances to the Abbey Wood complex", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/01/11/44909413-9744937-image-a-18_1625137140379.jpg"], ["Retired vicar Parfitt sat in a camping chair (pictured above) alongside a friend, Gaie Delap, on the entrance side of the road with other protesters on the opposite side", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/01/11/44909411-9744937-image-a-19_1625137142702.jpg"], ["Parfitt (pictured above, in February 2020) was found guilty of obstructing the highway - having stopped 'dozens' of MoD workers from going to work", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/01/12/44909409-9744937-image-m-22_1625137395068.jpg"], ["It follows last week's Supreme Court (file photo, above) ruling which quashed the convictions of four people who had been arrested for blocking a road leading to London's ExCel centre, where a huge arms and defence fair was taking place in 2017", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/01/12/44910593-9744937-image-a-23_1625137626794.jpg"]], "author": ["Katie Weston For Mailonline"], "date": "2021-07-01"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9789251/Outcry-Met-Polices-Dame-Cressida-Dick-says-hopes-stay-four-years.html": {"title": "How can she demand to go on?

And Met Police has faced criticism over Wembley breach and Sarah Everard vigil.", "text": "Victims\u00a0of Scotland Yard incompetence reacted with fury last night to reports that Dame Cressida Dick will seek an extension as the country\u2019s top police officer.\\nThe Metropolitan Police commissioner has been caught up in a string of controversies including criticism of the force\u2019s handling of security at the Euro 2020 final at Wembley on Sunday night.\\nBut Dame Cressida is reported to be on the brink of applying for an extension of her initial five-year contract which expires in April.\\nIf accepted, she could remain in charge for up to another four years.\\nFormer Tory MP Harvey Proctor, who lost his home and job over the Met\u2019s disastrous Operation Midland investigation into spurious VIP child sex abuse allegations, said: \u2018She is a disgrace and should have resigned long ago.\\n\u2018It is time for her to go because of Operation Midland, not to be seeking any extension to her employment at the Met.\\n'In my opinion, she has a personal responsibility for setting back the public purse millions of pounds as part of the Operation Midland investigation.\u2019\\nMr Proctor, who received \u00a3900,000 from the Met in compensation and legal costs over the fiasco, said: \u2018I hold her culpable for her role in a severe waste of public funds which severely impacted a number of lives, including mine.\u2019\\nRadio DJ Paul Gambaccini, who was arrested during the Operation Yewtree child sex abuse inquiry in 2013 and spent a year on bail before the case was dropped, described Dame Cressida as an officer who \u2018shames the Met\u2019.\\nHe added: \u2018As I am concerned she is unworthy of any position from commissioner down to dog catcher.\\n\u2018The disastrous mistakes made during Operation Midland and beyond it would have been enough to have ended her predecessor Bernard Hogan-Howe\u2019s career and should have been more than enough to end hers.\u2019\\nHe said: \u2018Under her tenure there has been a mafia-style culture of \u201comerta\u201d \u2013 the boys in blue huddle in a circle together and don\u2019t let anyone in or any truth out.\\n\u2018We have waited for decades for the truth in the Stephen Lawrence case, for Operation Midland, Yewtree, the killing of Daniel Morgan and many more.\\n\u2018This is because the Met obfuscates at every opportunity and [does] not want the public to know of its failures.\u2019\\nMr Gambaccini, who received a payout from the Crown Prosecution Service in 2018 over the unfounded allegations levelled at him, said it was vital to draw a line under Dame Cressida\u2019s tenure.\\nThe commissioner, 60, who was formally made a dame commander by Prince Charles yesterday in recognition of her public service, indicated she was \u2018happy\u2019 to remain in the top job.\\nSpeaking after the ceremony at St James\u2019s Palace, she said: \u2018I\u2019m very focused on my job, I love my job, it\u2019s a huge honour \u2013 it\u2019s a real privilege to be doing my job. I\u2019m very happy.\u2019\\nDowning Street refused to be drawn on whether the Prime Minister supported her being given another term.\\nBoris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u2018She retains his full confidence but I\u2019m not going to get drawn into the future appointments process.\u2019\\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan, who oversees the Met\u2019s day-to-day operations, also said the commissioner continued to have his support, adding: \u2018She has not told me what her intentions are.\u2019\\nConservative peer Lord Lexden, who has campaigned for a detailed independent investigation into Operation Midland, said Dame Cressida should leave at the end of her term to allow Scotland Yard to \u2018make a fresh start under a new leader\u2019.\\nHe added: \u2018She is well regarded within the Met but that is not enough. The charge sheet against her is just too long and grows longer.\\n\u2018The names of really able senior police officers up and down our country \u2013 capable of providing the inspiring leadership that is desperately needed \u2013 should be sent by MPs and community leaders to the Home Secretary personally, bypassing Home Office officials with their craven attitudes to law and order.\u2019\\nDame Cressida\u2019s leadership of the force and its integrity have come under increasing scrutiny in recent months after a series of damaging events.\\nOn Friday Met Police officer Wayne Couzens pleaded guilty to murdering marketing executive Sarah Everard, 33, after previously admitting her kidnap and rape.\\nThe force faces serious questions about why Couzens was not arrested earlier for alleged flashing offences.\\nThe Met was also criticised over policing of a vigil for Miss Everard at Clapham Common, near where she disappeared, but its tactics were later cleared by a watchdog.\\nA report into the unsolved 1987 murder of private investigator Daniel Morgan, published last month, also accused the Metropolitan Police of \u2018institutional corruption\u2019.\\nThe force under successive commissioners including Dame Cressida had concealed or denied failings in the case to protect its own reputation, the report concluded.\\nMr Morgan\u2019s brother Alastair said last night: \u2018I\u2019m disappointed, frustrated and angry at these reports that Cressida Dick intends to stay in charge of the Metropolitan Police. She should go.\u2019\\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey also called for her to go.\\n\u2018The Met desperately needs new leadership to change the culture of cover up rather than own up at the top of the organisation,\u2019 he said last night.\\n\u2018Met Police officers who work incredibly hard and risk their lives to keep us safe deserve far better.\\n\u2018They need new leadership that will change the culture and rebuild the public trust and confidence that officers need to do their jobs and keep us safe.\u2019\\nThe commissioner is expected to make a formal announcement on whether she will apply for an extension within weeks.\\nIf she decides to leave, the process to select a successor would have to begin by the end of summer.\\nDame Cressida\u2019s predecessor Lord Hogan-Howe asked for a lengthy contract extension but was given only one year, during which he retired early.\\nThe scandals on her watch: Shooting dead of Tube passenger\\nCressida Dick was Gold Commander in charge of the operation which resulted in an innocent man being shot dead on July 22, 2005.\\nSurveillance officers searching for those responsible for the failed terror attacks the day before shot Brazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes after he entered Stockwell underground station.\\nTwo years later the Met was found guilty of a series of errors around the tragedy, although Dame Cressida was exonerated.\\nShe continued to support her officers saying they had acted in accordance with information they had at the time. Sources have described the control room where the ill-fated operation was run as \u2018utterly chaotic\u2019.\\n'Culture of cover up' over fantastist Nick\\nOperation Midland resulted in the targeting of high-profile individuals after a fantasist falsely claimed he was the childhood victim of a paedophile ring.\\nTaking the preposterous claims of Carl Beech \u2013 aka \u2018Nick\u2019 \u2013 at face value, Met officers searched the homes of former Tory MP Harvey Proctor, Lord Bramall the former chief of defence staff, and Lady Brittan, widow of the former Tory home secretary Leon Brittan.\\nOperation Midland collapsed in March 2016. No charges or arrests were made. Beech was later convicted of fraud and perverting the course of justice and sentenced to 18 years in prison.\\nAn inquiry by retired high court judge, Sir Richard Henriques, found more than 40 failings in the police operation.\\nA subsequent damning report revealed that the Met had delayed implementing most of the reforms and Dame Cressida, who had been briefly involved in the original operation as assistant commissioner, faced pressure to resign.\\nSir Richard later called for a criminal investigation into five detectives and said confidence in the criminal justice system had been damaged.\\nAmid allegations of a Met cover-up, Home Secretary Priti Patel is under mounting pressure to instigate a series of new independent inquiries into Midland.\\nDame Cressida is not out of the woods on this one. In a bombshell interview in the Mail in February, Lady Brittan threw the book at the Met over its \u2018culture of cover up and flick away\u2019 under the Commissioner, who has repeatedly defended Steve Rodhouse, the serial bungling senior officer in charge of Midland. Further developments on the Midland scandal are expected in the coming weeks.\\nEasy ride for eco mob\\nIn 2019, much of Britain was amazed as thousands of climate change protesters brought central London to a standstill.\\nRoads around Parliament Square, Waterloo Bridge, Oxford Circus and Marble Arch were blocked for days but the police seemed powerless to intervene.\\nDame Cressida later said that Extinction Rebellion came in larger numbers than expected and used new tactics, but admitted police should have responded quicker.\\nAxe death corruption\\nIn 1987, private detective Daniel Morgan was found dead in a car park with an axe embedded in his head.\\nNo one has ever been convicted over his killing.\\nLast month, the Met was described as \u2018institutionally corrupt\u2019 and Dame Cressida herself was personally censured for obstruction following an eight year independent inquiry.\\nShe was named as one of those responsible for delaying the panel\u2019s access to the police database.\\nLast week Mr Morgan\u2019s brother Alastair called on her to resign.\\nGun cop abducts and murders Sarah Everard\\nWhen PC Wayne Couzens pleaded guilty last week to the murder of Sarah Everard, Dame Cressida described his actions as a crime that had \u2018sickened, angered and devastated\u2019 the Met.\\nCouzens, a former diplomatic protection officer, abducted Miss Everard, 33, from a south London street in March.\\nIt later emerged 12 police officers allegedly failed to investigate previous incidents of indecent exposure by Couzens.\\nA key question, which Dame Cressida needs to answer, is how was an individual like Couzens accepted into the Met. What vetting did, or didn\u2019t, take place?\\nShe also faced criticism over whether the Met acted in a \u2018heavy-handed\u2019 manner arresting women at a vigil for Miss Everard on Clapham Common.\\nA report by Sir Thomas Winsor, the chief inspector of constabulary later concluded that Met officers had acted \u2018lawfully, sensitively and proportionately\u2019.\\nQuestions over her top brass\\nDame Cressida has made a number of highly questionable senior appointments since taking charge of the Met four years ago.\\nShe brought Sir Stephen House out of retirement to be her deputy three years after he stepped down as Chief Constable of Scotland after a series of controversies.\\nHe is seen as her key enforcer and protector, as is Helen Ball, another key ally who is one of her assistant commissioners.\\nMs Ball has been by accused by Harvey Proctor of blocking legitimate complaints about Operation Midland.\\nIncredibly Dame Cressida also promoted a senior officer found guilty of bullying at Essex Police, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matthew Horne, to be head of professional standards.\\nSelfies taken beside bodies\\nAfter the sickening, random murders of sisters Bibaa Henry, 46, and Nicole Smallman, 27, in a park in Wembley last June, Dame Cressida admitted there was \u2018much more to be done\u2019 to improve trust in the force.\\nOfficers were not sent out to look for the women, pictured, until 36 hours after they were last seen alive.\\nEven more appallingly, two police have also been charged over taking selfies with the women\u2019s bodies when they were supposed to be guarding the crime scene.\\nThe women\u2019s mother, Mina Smallman, a retired archdeacon, said police had \u2018made assumptions\u2019 about her daughters because they were black.\\nLast week, Danyal Hussein, 19, was convicted at the Old Bailey of the women\u2019s murders.\\nSurge in killings of teenagers\\nLondon is on track for its worst year ever for teenage killings, with 22 dying this year, 19 of whom had been stabbed.\\nIf the current rate continues, the number of teen fatalities in 2021 will top 30 for the first time.\\nThe youngest victim this year was Fares Maatou, 14, who was allegedly stabbed to death with a Samurai sword during a row over an e-scooter. In May, Dame Cressida told LBC that tackling violent crime was her \u2018number one priority\u2019.\\nThe Met was criticised last year for multiple errors in its stop and search policy, with the police watchdog saying there was \u2018much room for improvement\u2019.\\nIn one case it found police had stopped and searched two black men for fist bumping, which they mistook for drug dealing.\\nIf the Yard\u2019s Dame of Disaster doesn\u2019t quit, she MUST be decommissioned\\nBy Nazir Afzal for the Daily Mail\\nWhat an unlucky police commissioner Cressida Dick has proved to be.\\nShe has suffered a litany of catastrophes during her time as head of the Metropolitan police - and to hear her tell it, not one has been her fault.\\nNo: the fact is that her failure to take responsibility is the root of all her problems.\\nBecause she will not accept blame or set an example as a leader, she has lost the confidence of both the public and her own officers.\\nHer mantra seems to be: \u2018It\u2019s not my responsibility, guv. Nothing to do with me.\u2019\\nShe is weak, indecisive and, on the evidence of her own record, incompetent. The time is long past for her to fall on her sword.\\nYet astonishingly, reports yesterday claimed that she intends next month to attempt to extend her five-year fixed contract, which is due to expire in April.\\nRecent calls for her to resign have been brushed away on the basis that her tenure was due to come to an end next year regardless.\\nNow we know she reportedly intends to continue running the force \u2014 a thought that deeply concerns me.\\nIf she cannot recognise that she must resign then, for the good of the force and the safety of all Londoners, it\u2019s up to Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, and the Home Secretary Priti Patel to tell Dame Cressida that she must go.\\nBut that very honorific must make her feel invulnerable. Only yesterday morning, at an investiture ceremony at St James\u2019s Palace, she was appointed Dame Commander of the British Empire by Prince Charles.\\nIt is inevitable, as night follows day, that Met Commissioners will be honoured by the Establishment, receiving peerages, knighthoods, damehoods and various other baubles.\\nBut the timing of this honour is particularly unfortunate. Coming as it does in the wake of two more deeply embarrassing foul-ups this month alone, her appearance at the palace will leave her officers feeling more exasperated than ever.\\nIt\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that the Home Office, and Priti Patel in particular, want Dame Cressida to stay.\\nThe accident-prone commissioner makes a convenient human shield. As long as she is absorbing all the flak, senior politicians are out of the firing line.\\nI have been demanding her resignation since the debacle of the women\u2019s vigil for murder victim Sarah Everard in March this year.\\nThe 33-year-old marketing executive was abducted and killed by a serving police officer, PC Wayne Couzens, as she walked home.\\nCressida Dick and her team seemed to be caught completely unawares by the number of women who turned up to mourn and demonstrate.\\nAt the time, I was staggered that the Met could be oblivious to the depth of public feeling.\\nThe Duchess of Cambridge was one of those, after all, who quietly came to express her sorrow. What clearer indication could there be that the killing touched a national nerve?\\nNever was it more important that a protest was policed with sensitivity and respect. A woman was dead at the hands of a policeman.\\nYet the Met ordered the cancellation of the vigil and then, when women turned up in defiance, bullied and manhandled them in pictures that shocked the country.\\nAnd how starkly those scenes contrasted with the policing of other protests, such as the Black Lives Matter marches last year, when some officers took the knee in sympathy with the crowds and others ran away from protesters.\\nNow we had the distressing spectacle of women chanting \u2018Arrest your own!\u2019 during clashes with police \u2014 on a day when the killer had indeed been arrested and charged.\\nI believe Dame Cressida\u2019s position became untenable that day. Yet she has clung on for months \u2014 and last week, as Couzens pleaded guilty to murder, she had the gall to say she felt betrayed by his actions.\\nIt seems to me that it was Cressida who betrayed her officers. Wayne Couzens should never have been allowed to wear the uniform in the first place.\\nNearly ten years ago, he had such a bad reputation among colleagues at the Civil Nuclear Constabulary for making female officers feel uncomfortable, he was crudely nicknamed \u2018the rapist\u2019.\\nWhile serving with the Met, he was reported for driving while semi-naked.\\nTwo accusations of indecent exposure were not properly investigated.\\nThe ultimate responsibility lies with Cressida Dick.\\nIf Couzens had been properly investigated and dismissed, as he would certainly have been by most employers, Sarah Everard might well be alive today.\\nYet that is far from her only disgrace. The errors of her tenure come thick and fast.\\nThere has already been another major blunder since Couzens appeared at the Old Bailey on Friday.\\nScenes at Wembley stadium on Sunday shamed the nation, as hundreds \u2014 probably thousands \u2014 of football supporters without tickets for the Euro final stormed the gates. After brawling with stewards and overcoming the pitifully inadequate police presence, they gained access to the stands.\\nAfter the match, as the crowd tried to leave, we saw more outbreaks of violence and chaos.\\nThe police were powerless to prevent this, because they were not adequately prepared.\\nSenior officers can hardly blame a lack of prior warning.\\nTalk of storming the turnstiles had been all over social media at the weekend. It\u2019s one more example of dreadful leadership and inexplicable decisions by the commissioner.\\nAnd it\u2019s one for which Britain will pay a high price.\\nMany believe that the collapse of security at Wembley, together with the vile racism directed at some players, have effectively ended our hopes of hosting the World Cup in 2030.\\nWe now know the final itself came close to being called off. What an international humiliation that would have been. Add to this the epidemic of knife crime, which has seen teenage murders in the capital soar to a 13-year high, the findings of the investigation in to the 1987 axe murder of Daniel Morgan that the Met has been \u2018institutionally corrupt\u2019, and numerous other scandals.\\nBefore she was appointed to the top job, I had great respect for Cressida Dick. When I was Chief Crown Prosecutor, and then chief executive of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners until 2017, I knew her slightly and regarded her as an outstanding investigator.\\nUnfortunately, her talents have not proved equal to managing the biggest budget of any police force in the country, with tens of thousands of officers under her command.\\nShe complains that she is the target of \u2018armchair critics\u2019.

it's a real privilege to be doing my job, I'm very happy.'\\nMr Khan meanwhile said: 'It was not right what happened on Sunday, not just at Wembley, but across our city, with the hooligans from outside London breaking the law in Leicester Square, Liverpool Street, Trafalgar Square, Wembley and so forth.\\n'The FA are reviewing their arrangements at Wembley, the Met Police Service will take part in that review.'\\nHe added the force was examining CCTV and body-worn videos and highlighted that 19 officers had been injured: 'What's also really important, that I say loudly and clearly: the police have my full confidence and full support.'\\nDame Cressida's leadership of the force and its integrity have come under increasing scrutiny in recent months following a series of damaging events.\\nOn Friday, Met Police Pc Wayne Couzens pleaded guilty to the murder of Sarah Everard after previously admitting her kidnap and rape.\\nThe Met was also criticised over the policing of a vigil for Miss Everard at Clapham Common, near where she disappeared, which was mired in controversy after officers arrested a number of protesters.\\nA recent report into the unsolved 1987 murder of private investigator Daniel Morgan also accused the Met of 'institutional corruption' after concluding the force had concealed or denied failings in the case to protect its reputation.\\nThe Met Police boss was made a dame in Theresa May's resignation honours in 2019 and said about the recognition: 'It's absolutely fantastic, a huge honour, wonderful to meet His Royal Highness and to be here in St James's Palace.\\n'I'm receiving it on behalf of all my hardworking colleagues who have over nearly 40 years given me massive support and been absolutely brilliant.'\\nDame Cressida began her career in the capital with the Met in 1983 before moving to Thames Valley Police and returning to London to hold a variety of command roles in the police response to the 9/11 attacks and the Boxing Day tsunami in 2004.\\nShe was thrust into the public eye in 2005 after she was in charge of the operation that led to the fatal shooting of Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes, who was wrongly identified as a potential suicide bomber.\\nA jury later cleared her of any blame in his death.\\nShe was the national lead for counter-terrorism for three years, and also led security operations for the Queen's diamond jubilee and 2012 Olympics before being appointed commissioner in 2017, the first woman to hold the post.\\nLooking back she said: 'I think it's true today as it was when I joined in 1983 -

'The road to reconciliation does not start by tearing Canada down,' the Conservative leader said, admitting that Canada is 'not a perfect country.'\\nBy Harry Howard, History Correspondent for MailOnline\\nMore than 150,000 indigenous children were forcibly taken from their families and placed in residential schools across Canada from 1863 until the 1970s.\\nThe system was created by Christian churches and the Canadian government in the 19th century in an attempt to 'assimilate' and convert indigenous youngsters into Canadian society.\\nThe children were forced to cut their long hair, banned from speaking their own languages and many were both physically and sexually abused.\\nAn estimated 6,000 children are believed to have died at the schools. Yesterday's protests -which saw the toppling of statues of both Queen Victoria and current Queen Elizabeth II - came after a series of discoveries of mass graves in recent weeks and months.\\nThe latest find - on Wednesday - of 182 children's bodies was made by an indigenous group using ground-penetrating radar at the former St. Eugene's Mission School in Cranbrook, British Columbia.\\nIn the US, a similar system of boarding schools, for Native Americans, existed with the aim of 'civilising' children into Western culture.\\nThe US system was in place from the mid-19th century until the mid-20th century.\\n\\n\\nDid Queen Victoria or the Queen have any influence over the schools policy?\\nIn 1867, the Canadian confederation of what had been separate British colonies in North America were established, creating a self-governing state within the British Empire.\\nQueen Victoria, who ruled from 1837 until her death in 1901, was on the throne when the residential school system was in full swing.\\nVictoria never visited Canada and \u2013 given her status as a constitutional monarch - had very limited influence over the Government in the UK and even less ability to question policies made in Canada.\\nThe system was largely a result of Canada's Indian Act, which was passed in 1876 under Canada's Liberal Prime Minister Alexander MacKenzie, with no influence from the British Government.\\nHowever, prior to Confederation, it was the passing of the Gradual Civilisation Act \u2013 which required indigenous people to speak either English or French \u2013 which the system ultimately rested on.\\nIts aim was for indigenous people to 'no longer be deemed an Indian' and instead become a regular British subject.\\n\\nIn 1920, attendance at the residential schools became compulsory for indigenous children between the ages of 7 and 15.\\nWhen Dominion Status was formally granted to Canada in 1926, it was recognised as an 'autonomous' community within the British Empire.\\nIn 1931, the Statue of Westminster confirmed its full legislative independence, although full sovereignty was not formally passed until 1982.\\nIt meant that, while the indigenous school system continued, the British Government and Monarch were not involved in its maintenance.\\nIt wasn't until 1982 that the Canadian Constitution was amended to recognize the rights of 'Indian, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis peoples of Canada'.\\nQueen Elizabeth II, who remains Canada's monarch, has a purely constitutional role both in the UK and in former British colonies where she remains head of state.\\nIt means that, while statues of her have been toppled, she had no ability to influence Canada's residential school system.\\nA statue of 18th century British explorer Captain James Cook was also targeted in the recent protests.\\nThe Royal Navy captain famously made three voyages in the Pacific Ocean and to Australia, but did also spend time in Canada.\\nHe was involved in the blockade of Louisbourg against French forces in 1758 and in 1761 made charts of the town and harbour at Halifax.\\nHe also took part in the assault on the then French-held Quebec.\\n\\nThousands held a similar rally in Montreal with slogans like 'Happy denial day.'\\n'I come here because I have small children and I think it's important to send the message that we don't want our children to be touched, to be mistreated,' said an emotional Therese Dube, 56, an indigenous woman from the Akikamekw nation and a survivor of one of the residential schools in Quebec.\\nApril Courtney Kipling, a 29-year-old indigenous woman, came 'to remember, to recognize all the children who will never go home.'\\nOthers had a more pointed reason for showing up. 'Canada Day is like celebrating genocide,' said Olivia Lya, a 22-year-old Innu woman.\\n'Anyone celebrating Canada on July 1 is celebrating oppression,' said Nakuset, co-organiser of the Montreal Native Women's Shelter, in a statement.\\nSeveral indigenous people noted the presence of non-indigenous Canadians at the Montreal rally.\\n'It's hopeful, it shows that people are listening,' said Nadine Bellerose Lavallee, a 50-year-old Metis woman.\\nProtests in support of the indigenous children also took place on Thursday in Toronto, Canada's financial hub, while a #CancelCanadaDay march in the capital Ottawa drew thousands in support of victims and survivors of the residential school system.\\nVigils and rallies were held across other parts of the country. Many participants wore orange clothing, which has become the symbol of the movement.\\nIn his Canada Day message, Trudeau said the discoveries of the remains of the children at the former schools 'have rightfully pressed us to reflect on our country's historical failures'. Injustices still exist for indigenous peoples and many others in Canada, he said.\\nThe row intensified earlier this month when\u00a0indigenous group in Canada's Saskatchewan province said it had found the unmarked graves of 751 people at a now-defunct Catholic residential school where tribal children were 'assimilated' into society.\\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was 'terribly saddened' by the new discovery at Marieval Indian Residential School,\u00a0and told indigenous people that 'the hurt and the trauma that you feel is Canada\u00b4s responsibility to bear.'\\nIt comes just one month after 215 children were found at another residential school near Kamloops, British Columbia - taking the total to more than 1,000.\\nThe Marieval Indian Residential School remains were found after the First Nation teamed up with an underground radar detection team from Saskatchewan Polytechnic just over three weeks ago.\\nCowessess First Nation Chief Cadmus Delorme\u00a0said that the graves were marked at one time, but that the Roman Catholic Church that operated the school had removed the markers.\\n'Canada will be known as a nation who tried to exterminate the First Nations. Now we have evidence,' said Bobby Cameron, Chief of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, which represents 74 First Nations in Saskatchewan.\\n'This is just the beginning.'\\nFrom the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 First Nations children were required to attend state-funded Christian schools as part of a program to assimilate them into Canadian society.\\nThey were forced to convert to Christianity and not allowed to speak their native languages.\\nMany were beaten and verbally abused, and up to 6,000 are said to have died.\\n'This was a crime against humanity, an assault on First Nations,' said Chief Bobby Cameron of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous First Nations in Saskatchewan. He said he expects more graves will be found on residential school grounds across Canada.\\n'We will not stop until we find all the bodies,' he said.\\nCanada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) report in 2015 said:\u00a0'Many students who went to residential school never returned. \u00adThey were lost to their families.\\n'Th\u00adey died at rates that were far higher than those experienced by the general school-aged population. \u00ad\\n'Their parents were often uninformed of their sickness and death. Th\u00adey were buried away from their families in long-neglected graves.'\\nThe Canadian government apologized in Parliament in 2008 and admitted that physical and sexual abuse in the schools was rampant.\\nMany students recall being beaten for speaking their native languages; they also lost touch with their parents and customs.\\nIndigenous leaders have cited that legacy of abuse and isolation as the root cause of epidemic rates of alcoholism and drug addiction on reservations.\\nLast month the remains of 215 children, some as young as three years old, were found buried on the site of what was once Canada's largest Indigenous residential school near Kamloops, British Columbia.\\nThose youngsters were students at the Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia that closed in 1978, according to the Tk'eml\u00faps te Secwepemc Nation, which said the remains were found with the help of a ground penetrating radar specialist.\\nNone of them have been identified, and it remains unclear how they died. Survivors fear more bodies will be found at the same site - as well as at the 80 other former residential school sites across Canada.\\nThe Kamloops discovery reopened old wounds in Canada about the lack of information and accountability around the residential school system, which forcibly separated indigenous children from their families and subjected them to malnutrition and physical and sexual abuse.\\n'The Pope needs to apologize for what happened,' Delorme said. 'An apology is one stage in the way of a healing journey.'\\nPope Francis said in early June that he was pained by the Kamloops revelation and called for respect for the rights and cultures of native peoples. But he stopped short of the direct apology some Canadians had demanded.\\n'It's a harsh reality and it's our truth, it's our history,' Tk'eml\u00faps te Secwepemc Chief Rosanne Casimir told a media conference Friday.\\n'And it's something that we've always had to fight to prove. To me, it's always been a horrible, horrible history.'\\n", "image": [["A gigantic statue of Queen Victoria has been torn down and daubed in red paint in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on Canada Day as a backlash over the country's colonial history ramps up", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/02/10/44951837-9749001-image-a-12_1625218195213.jpg"], ["Queen Elizabeth's\u00a0 statue was also torn down amid growing anger in Canada over the treatment of its indigenous communities over hundreds of years", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/02/10/44951727-9749001-image-a-2_1625217739322.jpg"], ["Video footage showing the statue leaning forward and then falling flat after being pulled down by the mob", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/02/15/44962785-9749001-image-a-44_1625237812384.jpg"], ["Video footage showing the statue leaning forward and then falling flat after being pulled down by the mob", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/02/15/44962787-9749001-image-m-43_1625237809687.jpg"], ["The defaced statue after being toppled during a rally, following the discovery of the remains of hundreds of children at former indigenous residential schools, outside the provincial legislature on Canada Day in Winnipeg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/02/14/44954219-9749001-The_defaced_statue_after_being_toppled_during_a_rally_following_-a-14_1625232701765.jpg"], ["Victoria's face appears to have been smothered with a flag with a rope used to tear it down before it was covered in paint", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/02/11/44951839-9749001-Victoria_s_face_appears_to_have_been_smothered_with_a_flag_with_-a-3_1625220439667.jpg"], ["One protester places a boot on Queen Victoria's toppled statue in Winnipeg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/02/12/44954045-9749001-image-a-64_1625226433089.jpg"], ["A wooden red dress symbolising the struggle of indigenous people in Canada and severed bronze leg of Capt.

However, her leadership of the force and its integrity have come under increasing scrutiny following a series of failures.\\nOn her watch, ticketless football hooligans broke past Wembley's security barriers on Sunday and stormed the grounds ahead of England's clash with Italy. The Met was accused of not having enough officers on duty to create a 'ring of steel' around he venue to hold back the frenzied England supporters.\\nDame Cressida has also faced questions about why Sarah Everard's killer Wayne Couzens, an armed member of the elite Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection squad, was not arrested before he kidnapped, raped and murdered the 33-year-old marketing manager for flashing offences previously reported to the police.\\nShe faced calls to resign after women were arrested at a vigil in Clapham Common held in memory of Miss Everard, in scenes that shocked the nation and sparked widespread condemnation of the Met. At the time, she defended the force's crackdown of the gathering and dismissed so-called 'armchair' critics, adding: 'What has happened makes me more determined, not less, to lead my organisation.'\\nThe force has also been deemed 'institutionally corrupt' by an independent panel investigating police inquiries into the unsolved murder in the 1980s of private detective Daniel Morgan.\\nAdditionally, teenager murders are hurtling towards a 13-year high as sources close to Dame Cressida said she remained committed to driving down youth violence - her supposed priority when she became the Met's first female commissioner in 2017. Nearly two dozens teenagers have died this year and the easing of lockdown has seen a spike in violent crimes.\\nLondon Mayor Saqid Khan today insisted the\u00a0Met Police have his full support despite the chaotic scenes in Wembley and across the capital at the Euro 2020 final, adding\u00a0\u00a0'we have to look at where the failure lies' over the security breach.\\nAmid speculation that Dame Cressida is considering seeking an extension to her term in Scotland Yard, Mr Khan said: 'She has not told me what her intentions are.' He added that though\u00a0the police had his full confidence, he often had 'difficult' conversations with senior officers.\\nCressida Dick has been embroiled in a string of controversies during her 38-year career at the Met.\\nIn July 2005 she was in overall charge of the operation which saw electrician Jean Charles de Menezes, 27, shot dead on a Tube train in south London.\\nMr de Menezes, a Brazilian working in the capital, was blasted in the head seven times by police at Stockwell station after being followed by officers from his home nearby.\\nLater inquiries heard he appeared to match the description of suspects whose bombs failed to detonate on the transport system the previous day.\\nTheir attempted attack followed the 7/7 atrocity which killed 52 people on Tubes and a bus in London earlier that month.\\nDame Cressida was cleared of all blame by later inquiries, but Mr de Menezes' family expressed 'serious concerns' when she was appointed Met Commissioner in 2017.\\nThe top policewoman, 60, told the Mail in 2018: 'It was an appalling thing - an innocent man killed by police. Me in charge. Awful for the family and I was properly held to account. We learned every lesson that was to be learned.\\n'My job was to stand up and be counted, tell the truth and carry on. If police officers fell to pieces or resigned when operations didn't go well, it wouldn't send out a good message.'\\nIn 2014 Dame Cressida was an assistant commissioner during the creation of Operation Midland \u2013 the Met's investigation into spurious VIP child sex abuse allegations.\\nInnocent men, including the late Lord Brittan and former Tory MP Harvey Proctor, were pursued by the force.\\nThe Met's star witness 'Nick' was later revealed to be serial liar Carl Beech.\\nIn 2017 Dame Cressida was criticised for her choice of words after she said the victims of the London Bridge terror attack demonstrated London's 'diversity'.\\nThe officer added: 'We believe, of course, that that's what makes our city so great. It's a place where the vast majority of time it's incredibly integrated and that diversity gives us strength.'\\nIn 2019 the Met under Dame Cressida's leadership was widely criticised for its 'light-touch' policing of Extinction Rebellion protests.\\nThe environmental demonstrators were allowed to blockade key areas of the capital for days, including Westminster Bridge and Oxford Circus.\\nDame Cressida has faced a particularly difficult 2021. She faced huge pressure to resign over the Met's handling of a vigil in memory to murdered Sarah Everard - who was raped and murdered by serving officer Wayne Couzens.\\nWomen were pushed to the floor and arrested after being asked to leave the area due to Covid rules - leading to accusations of 'heavy-handedness'.\\nPolice were later exonerated in a watchdog report.\\nHowever the pressure mounted again last month when\u00a0\u00a0a damning inquiry into the 1987 murder of a private investigator who was looking into bent cops branded her force 'institutionally corrupt' and condemned her for blocking the gathering of evidence.\\nShe said it was a 'matter of great regret that no one has been brought to justice' in the case of Daniel Morgan, who was killed with an axe to the head in the car park of the Golden Lion pub in Sydenham, south-east London.\\nBut she refused to resign over the matter, despite calls from Mr Morgan's family to consider her position.\\nMr Khan said: 'It was not right what happened on Sunday - not just at Wembley, but across our city with the hooligans, from outside London, breaking the law in Leicester Square, Liverpool Street, Trafalgar Square, Wembley, and so forth. The FA are reviewing their arrangements at Wembley, the Met Police Service will take part in that review.\\n'The Met Police Service as we speak are sifting through the CCTV and body-worn videos. Already, 86 arrests have been made. I'd remind people that 19 police officers were injured. It's really important that those responsible for criminal behaviour are arrested, charged and prosecuted.\\n'What's also really important, that I say loudly and clearly: the police have my full confidence and full support. One of my jobs as the mayor is to provide scrutiny of the police service to help provide the checks and balances in a vibrant democracy.\\n'The police should be properly policed and often that there are difficult conversations between me as mayor and the senior team at the Met Police Service, but they have got my full support.'\\nSources told the Times there will be informal discussions next month and the formal process will only begin if she receives an indication the Government wishes for her to stay. Without such an indication, she will be expected to resign.\\nHome Secretary Priti Patel makes the appointment, taking into consideration any recommendation from Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, who oversees the Met.\\nIt comes after a difficult year for the force, which has faced a barrage of criticism - and calls for Ms Dick to resign - over its handling of a vigil in memory of Miss Everard.\\nHundreds of women turned out to Clapham Common to pay their respects to the marketing manager after she was raped and murdered by a serving police officer.\\nBut some were pinned down to the floor and arrested after police urged the group - mainly consisting of young women - to leave the area.\\nThe All Party Parliamentary Group on Democracy and the Constitution (APPGDC) later said police had breached 'fundamental rights' in their handling of the vigil.\\nPerhaps the most damaging blot on her card is that of the shambolic Operation Midland - the Met's \u00a31milliion investigation into spurious VIP child sex abuse allegations.\\nInnocent men, including the late Lord Brittan and former Tory MP Harvey Proctor, were pursued by the force in a probe sanctioned in 2014 while Dame Cressida was an assistant commissioner.\\nThe Met's star witness 'Nick' was later revealed to be serial liar Carl Beech - who was jailed after police investigating his claims discovered his deceit.\u00a0Dame Cressida later apologised to those caught up in the investigation, including\u00a0Lady Brittan.\\nDespite the criticism, Dame Cressida does have backers and ones that might increase her chances of remaining in the \u00a3270,000-a-year commissioner role.\\nShe has regularly received the public backing from the Home Secretary - even amid reports of wavering support.\\nShe has won praise as the first ever female commissioner in the Met's 190-year history and is said to be popular among rank-and-file officers.\\nAnd she has managed to find a way to ride-out the controversies which have mounted up across her 40-year career - in turn winning praise for her resilience and even earning the nickname 'Comeback Cressida' in some circles.\\nLast month,\u00a0an independent panel on the death of private investigator Daniel Morgan found that the Met\u00a0had prioritised its reputation over finding Mr Morgan's killer - sparking allegations of institutional corruption in Scotland Yard.\\nIn its bombshell report, the Daniel Morgan Independent Panel concluded forms of police corruption had hampered both the murder inquiry, and its own work to investigate the reasons why the case was never solved.\\nSingling out Dame Cressida for blame, the report said she had not given a 'reasonable explanation' for blocking access to computer data and delaying the release of files, the last of which were provided only in March.\\nA Home Office source said there were 'serious concerns with the Met's leadership and how it responded to failings' - although Miss Patel and Boris Johnson later expressed confidence in Dame Cressida.\\nThe commissioner apologised for past mistakes, saying: 'It is a matter of great regret that no one has been brought to justice and that our mistakes have compounded the pain suffered by Daniel's family. For that I apologise again now.\\n'I have been personally determined that the Met provided the panel with the fullest level of co-operation in an open and transparent manner, with complete integrity at all times.'\\nBut amid calls\u00a0for her resignation, Dame Cressida said:\u00a0'I don't believe we are institutionally corrupt. No, I don't accept that. I have the deepest feelings for Daniel Morgan's family. They have shown extraordinary grit and determination and courage.\\n'Yesterday, I apologised again to them for our failings and the fact that we have not brought anybody to justice despite six investigations and countless other reviews and pieces of work.'\\nShe added: 'And for the fact that, in so doing and along the way, we have clearly, we the Met, my force, of which I'm very proud to be the Commissioner, we have caused them extra anguish. But I don't accept that we are institutionally corrupt, no.'\\nThe independent panel led by Baroness Nuala O'Loan found that the Met had put protecting its own reputation above finding Mr Morgan's killer.\\nThe panel's report said: 'Concealing or denying failings, for the sake of the organisation's public image, is dishonesty on the part of the organisation for reputational benefit and constitutes a form of institutional corruption.'\\nDame Cressida also came under the spotlight after it emerged that bosses at Scotland Yard missed three crucial clues about killer cop Couzens that could have seen him kicked out of the force before he murdered Miss Everard.\\n\\nCouzens, who kidnapped, raped and murdered the marketing executive while\u00a0she walked home from a friend's house in Clapham in March, was reported to bosses for allegedly slapping a female colleague's bottom at\u00a0Bromley police station in 2018 - just weeks after he joined the force.\\nShortly after starting at Bromley in South London, the married killer allegedly stopped a female motorist and said her tax and insurance were out of date before making a note of her address so he could later pull up outside her house and leer at her,\u00a0the Sun on Sunday reports.\\nCouzens, whose former colleagues at the Civil Nuclear Constabulary allegedly nicknamed him 'The Rapist' because of how he is said to have made female colleagues uneasy, is also accused of parking his patrol car by schools so he could watch mothers and sixth-formers.\\nA Metropolitan Police spokesman told MailOnline that it has no record of the allegations being passed to the Directorate of Professional Standards, and will assess any new allegation it receives 'appropriately'. The force previously told the Sun on Sunday: 'We are not able to respond to queries such as this while \u00adproceedings are ongoing.'\\nLast night it also emerged that police will be told to take offences such as indecent exposure and street harassment - what a Home Office source described to the Sunday Times as 'non-contact sexual offences' - more seriously in the wake of the murder.\\nThe latest allegations are likely to heap pressure on Commissioner Dame Cressida to explain why Couzens was not kicked out of the force - and why he became an armed member of the elite Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection squad at the time of Miss Everard's killing.", "image": [["Disaster-prone Met Police chief Cressida Dick has been made a Dame Commander by Prince Charles", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/14/11/45431491-9785965-Disaster_prone_Met_Police_chief_Cressida_Dick_has_been_made_a_Da-m-61_1626257986165.jpg"], ["Dame Cressida Dick wishes to continue in her role despite a string of controversies and the Wembley security scandal", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/14/09/45415949-9785965-Dame_Cressida_Dick_wishes_to_continue_in_her_role_despite_a_stri-a-36_1626252911631.jpg"], ["It comes after the Met faced criticism following violence at Wembley Stadium at the final of Euro 2020 on Sunday", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/14/09/45415973-9785965-It_comes_after_the_Met_faced_criticism_following_violence_at_Wem-a-37_1626252911641.jpg"], ["The Metropolitan Police commissioner faced calls for her resignation earlier this year after women were arrested at a vigil that was held in memory of Miss Everard", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/14/09/45417011-9785965-The_Metropolitan_Police_commissioner_faced_calls_for_her_resigna-a-38_1626252911643.jpg"], ["Dame Cressida was also slammed by the families of victims of VIP paedophile ring fantasist Carl Beech, whose spurious allegations were investigated by police - ruining the lives and reputations of those he accused", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/14/09/45416125-9785965-Dame_Cressida_was_also_slammed_by_the_families_of_victims_of_VIP-a-39_1626252911644.jpg"], ["Home Secretary Priti Patel makes the appointment, taking into consideration any recommendation from Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, who oversees the Met", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/14/09/45416491-9785965-The_Home_Secretary_Priti_Patel_makes_the_appointment_taking_into-a-40_1626252911646.jpg"], ["Cressida Dick has been embroiled in a string of controversies during her 38-year career at the Met", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/14/09/45429343-9785965-image-m-48_1626253153273.jpg"], ["Wayne Couzens' ex-colleagues at the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC), where the 48-year-old joined in March 2011, reportedly nicknamed him 'The Rapist", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/14/09/45271999-9785965-Wayne_Couzens_ex_colleagues_at_the_Civil_Nuclear_Constabulary_CN-a-41_1626252911649.jpg"], ["He was said to be given the nickname because he made some female officers feel uncomfortable", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/14/09/45274211-9785965-He_was_said_to_be_given_the_nickname_because_he_made_some_female-a-42_1626252911650.jpg"], ["Couzens has pleaded guilty to murdering 33-year-old Ms Everard (pictured above) after snatching her off the street while she walked home from a friend's house in Clapham in March", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/14/09/45272003-9785965-Couzens_has_pleaded_guilty_to_murdering_33_year_old_Ms_Everard_p-a-43_1626252911652.jpg"], ["Daniel Morgan, pictured, was investigating claims of corruption within the Metropolitan Police when he was murdered in 1987 - and the force failed him and his family ever since", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/14/09/44115721-9785965-Daniel_Morgan_pictured_was_investigating_claims_of_corruption_wi-a-44_1626252911652.jpg"], ["His brother Alastair told the media today that Cressida Dick should resign", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/14/09/44249541-9785965-His_brother_Alastair_told_the_media_today_that_Cressida_Dick_sho-a-45_1626252911653.jpg"]], "author": ["Amelia Clarke For The Daily Mail", "James Robinson", "Jack Wright For Mailonline"], "date": "2021-07-14"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9754215/Former-pilot-uses-48ft-long-plane-wreckage-centrepiece-RHS-Hampton-Court-Palace-exhibition.html": {"title": "Former easyJet pilot uses 48ft-long passenger plane wreckage as the centrepiece of RHS Hampton Court Palace exhibition in a bid to make visitors 'realise the climate change threat posed by air travel'", "subtitle": "The Extinction Garden at Hampton Court Palace features a 48ft long plane wreck.

I can quite easily tell you why savoury toppings on crumpets are better than sweet, how to make the perfect margarita and why I believe Real Housewives of New York is the greatest TV show of all time.\\nIf you ask me what I feel about Extinction Rebellion, Putin\u2019s Russia or the vaccination roll-out programme, however, I won\u2019t have an instantaneous opinion. I might have a thought or a feeling, but this generalised sense of what is right and what is wrong is often a kneejerk response. An opinion, to my mind, takes careful consideration and research. I\u2019d like to have a chance to hear what the experts think, to read into it and then come to a conclusion, rather than just rushing to Twitter to label it right or wrong in a fit of pique.\\nBut our modern ways don\u2019t allow for much reflection. The constant demands of social media, email, text and 24-hour news cycles have led us to the false conclusion that everything requires an immediate response \u2013 and that includes opinions.\\nIt\u2019s fascinating to me that although we live in an increasingly non-binary world in terms of gender, identity and personal outlook, opinions seem to have gone the other way. They\u2019ve become more binary. There\u2019s either correct or incorrect, as if opinions are semaphore for the tribe we want to belong to. Opinions are now worn in the same way as a political rosette: shorthand for \u2018this is who I am, and I define myself in opposition to the other lot\u2019.\\n\\nOpinions such as these make everyone angry and defensive, as though putting an alternative point of view is an assault on someone else\u2019s moral character. But surely we should be encouraged to talk to each other, to listen to those with whom we disagree rather than shutting them down?\\nFor me, a truly valuable opinion is one that encompasses nuance. It is expressed in shades of grey, not in black or white. Arguably, there are certain absolutes that are either right (saving a drowning child) or wrong (committing murder) and our shared acceptance of these norms is what a civilised society is built on. But in between these extremes, there are vast territories of ambiguity and complexity and opportunities to say, \u2018I don\u2019t know enough about that, tell me more.\u2019\\nAdmitting one\u2019s lack of knowledge is not always a weakness. It is impossible for everyone to know about everything, so saying you\u2019re not sure is, I believe, both a sign of intelligence and humility. It\u2019s a sign that you care enough to consider all the factors. It\u2019s a sign of respect and, to a degree, of empathy. It says: I am going to look into this so that I can see where you\u2019re coming from instead of screaming at you because I\u2019m angry you don\u2019t agree with me.\\nWe might think we know instinctively where we stand on a contentious issue, but let\u2019s not forget that instinct can also be prejudice by a different name. We can have good, helpful instincts \u2013 I will not walk into that fire barefoot. And we can have negative, blinkered instincts \u2013 that person looks different from me, so I don\u2019t like them. Healthy opinions are formed when we question our deep-rooted assumptions and allow for fluidity.\\nWe should all be more tolerant of each other \u2013 now let\u2019s extend that courtesy to opinions too.\\nThis week I'm...\\n\\n", "image": [["Styling: Holly Elgeti.

Eleanor McAree, 26, of Brentwood, was also in breach of a nine-month conditional discharge imposed in December 2019 for an Extinction Rebellion protest in London.\\nThe second defendant, Will Farbrother, 39, of Walthamstow, also pleaded guilty.\\nMcAree, who earns \u00a341,000 a year as a project manager, was fined \u00a3500 for the Broxbourne obstruction, plus \u00a3105 costs, \u00a350 victim surcharge and \u00a3150 for breaching the conditional discharge.\\nFarbrother, who is giving up his \u00a339,000 a year job as a civil servant to work with refugees in Athens, was of previous good character.

You all spoke in your defence with passion and clarity and it was obvious that you had thought carefully about what you were doing.'\\nExtinction Rebellion said it is considering an appeal against the convictions.\\nIn a statement after the hearing, an XR spokesperson said: 'We are astonished that Judge Fudge ruled there was no political interference in the police operation, despite overwhelming evidence.\\n'As floods devastate Europe, another heat dome is building in the United States, and environmental defenders across the world are being silenced, XR will continue to demand that the press tell the truth about the climate and ecological emergency.'\\nPreviously Liam Norton, 36, of Esplanade Gardens, Scarborough; Sally Davidson, 33, of Byards Croft, Streatham, south London; and James Ozden, 35, of The Avenue, London, were each given a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay prosecution costs of \u00a3150 and a statutory victim surcharge of \u00a322.\\nEleanor Bujak, 28, of Bracey Street, Finsbury Park, London and Morgan Trowland, 38, Massie Road, Hackney, east London, were both fined \u00a3150 and told to pay costs of \u00a3150, plus a victim surcharge of \u00a334.\\nTimothy Speers, of Rosswyld Lodge, Waltham Forest was fined \u00a3200 and ordered to pay \u00a3150 prosecution costs and a victim surcharge of \u00a334.", "image": [["Caspar Hughes, 49, of Exeter; Elise Yarde, 32, of Walthamstow; Amir Jones, 39, of London; Laura Frandsen, 30, of London; Charlotte Kirin, 51, of Bury St Edmunds; and Hazel Stenson, 56, of Bury St Edmunds all appeared (pictured) at St Albans Magistrates' Court on Friday", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/16/15/45526111-9795167-Caspar_Hughes_49_of_Exeter_Elise_Yarde_32_of_Walthamstow_Amir_Jo-m-62_1626444063205.jpg"], ["The court heard around 50 XR members used vehicles and bamboo structures, used as lock-ons, to deny access to or from the Broxbourne site", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/16/15/45526113-9795167-image-m-64_1626444123345.jpg"], ["The protest lasted 14 hours and those involved were targeting certain parts of the print media who, according to the defendants, 'failed to accurately report on the climate crisis and are guilty of corruption'", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/16/15/45526131-9795167-image-a-65_1626444149551.jpg"], ["From left to right: Liam Norton, James Ozen, Morgan Trouland, Ellenor Bujak, Tim Spears and Sally Davidson were tried previously", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/16/17/45526095-9795167-From_left_to_right_Liam_Norton_James_Ozen_Morgan_Trouland_Elleno-a-3_1626452059649.jpg"]], "author": ["Emer Scully For Mailonline"], "date": "2021-07-16"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9752227/BBC-Bitzesize-GCSE-revision-guides-list-POSITIVE-impacts-climate-change-removed.html": {"title": "BBC deletes GCSE revision guide that listed the UPSIDE of climate change after fury from environmental activists", "subtitle": "Among the 'benefits' was the creation of new shipping routes due to melting ice.
