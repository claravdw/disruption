Hampshire Police have confirmed eight people were arrested in Basingstoke and are in custody.\\nAnimal Rebellion say seven of their members were also arrested in Hemel Hempstead and remain in custody.\\nMeanwhile, the demonstration in Heywood, Greater Manchester, ended at 4am after 24 hours while the group in Coventry left at 10am this morning.\\nA spokesman for McDonalds confirmed that all four sites had reopened and were back delivering to the company's 1,300 restaurants.\\nJames Ozden, a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion,\u00a0said that\u00a0around 100 people took part in the protests and claimed the action disrupted an estimated 1,900 lorries.\\n'We've also got a report from someone in Manchester that they experienced limited McDonald's breakfast items due to the protest,' Mr Ozden said.\\nOne Twitter user from Glasgow wrote this afternoon: 'McDonalds has run out of fries because of the blockade.'\\nWhile Adrian Taylor, from Taunton, Somerset wrote: 'Hankridge Farm hasn't been reliable for a long time but today it hit rock bottom.. ran out of burgers... you had one job McDonald's, one job! #disappointed5yearold.'\\nMr Ozden said: 'The meat and dairy industry is destroying our planet: causing huge amounts of rainforest deforestation, emitting immense quantities of greenhouse gases and killing billions of animals each year.\\n'The only sustainable and realistic way to feed ten billion people is with a plant-based food system.

It apologised to customers for 'any disappointment caused'.\\nIn a video shared to Animal Rebellion's Twitter and Instagram accounts last night, group spokesman James Ozden said in Coventry: 'The protest removal teams have left, leaving only one car. And they've said there will be no protest removal tonight so all the vans have left.\\n'We will be guaranteed to be here up until 10am tomorrow morning which means we will have done a full 30 hours when we leave.'\\nThe activist said the absence of police 'shows the power of direct action'. He said the group planned to 'have a dance' as they headed into the evening.\\nFootage taken at the Coventry scene appeared to show some arrests earlier in the day.\u00a0West Midlands Police have been approached for comment.\\nThe group shared the clip with the caption: 'Police have left two sites. Both Coventry and Manchester police teams have left our two sites to continue blockading McDonalds until tomorrow morning.\\n'That will be a total of at least 30 hours. Another win for direct action! Now join the rebellion and get involved.'\\nA McDonalds spokesperson earlier said: 'Our distribution centres are currently facing disruption.\\n'We are assessing the impact on deliveries to our restaurants and to menu items. We apologise to our customers for any disappointment caused.'\\nThe group said in a statement:\u00a0'We're shutting down McDonald's distribution to all of its 1300 UK restaurants today because of their responsibility for the climate emergency, the cutting down of the Amazon rainforest to make way for grazing cattle, and their continued refusal to take action and shift to a plant-based menu.\\n'Our activists are locked into concrete tubes and secured on bamboo constructions, and it's wet and cold, but we're here until McDonald's release a statement or meet with us to discuss how they can play a fairer role in our collective future.\\n'For decades all they've been interested in is profit, with some of the unhealthiest foods you can eat. Climate change, deforestation, and animal agriculture are the greatest threats to this planet - not to mention the obesity crisis fed by fast food. There's no McFish on a dead planet. We need to act now.'\\nNick More, renewable energy developer and member of Amazon Rebellion, said yesterday: 'McDonald's and the wider animal agriculture industry is clearly responsible for huge levels of deforestation in the Amazon Basin and wider Pantanal region.\\n'Despite their apparent greenwashing, there is no transparency in their supply chain or independent audit sufficient to support their claims that they are not a driver of deforestation.'\\nProtester Linda Doyle, 28, was part of the blockade at McDonald's distribution centre in Coventry.\\nLinda, speaking from the top of a bamboo tower, said the campaigners planned to stay for at least 24 hours.\\nOther protestors at the site laid down in the road blocking lorries from exiting to supply restaurants with food products.\\nA truck with a banner reading 'Plant-based food system' is parked in the road blocking the route onto the site also.\\n'Animal Rebellion', affiliated with XR, claimed on Twitter that police teams left two sites in Coventry and Manchester to continue blockading the fast-food chain until tomorrow.\\nThey wrote: 'Both Coventry and Manchester police teams have left our two sites to continue blockading McDonalds until tomorrow morning.\\n'That will be a total of at least 30 hours.

A plant-based food system is possible.\\n'Civil disobedience and direct action does work, I was passionate about getting involved and I decided to sacrifice my Saturday to come down here.'\\nA fellow protestor, who wished to be identified only as Chris, blasted McDonald's for not taking action to prevent a climate crisis.\\nHe said: 'We're taking proportionate action in the face of the biggest unknown crisis humanity has ever faced.\\n'The climate crisis being fuelled by animal agriculture.\\n'McDonald's is a symbol of animal agriculture and corporate power. Their business model is profit at all costs.\\n'Profit at the expense of animals, people that are being pushed off their land in the Amazon rainforest.\\n'Other than add a vegan burger on their menu, McDonald's has done nothing to change this.\\n'Expecting people to change their behaviour is no longer appropriate, the time for action is now.'\\nA spokesman for Hampshire Constabulary said eight people have been arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass in relation to the Basingstoke demonstration.\\nSeven women aged between 18 and 51 and a 21-year-old man remain in custody.\\nChief Inspector Matt Reeves said: 'Everyone has the right to free speech and protest, however, officers will take necessary action against the few who deliberately choose to act outside the law.'\\nWest Midlands Police said the protest at Coventry was causing 'safety concerns' because it is blocking the exit and entrances of the building.\\nA spokesperson said: 'We are aware of a protest currently taking place in the Canley area of Coventry which is preventing access to a distribution centre.\\n'This is linked to a national day of action by animal rights activists.\\n'We have a police presence on site and have been engaging with the activists in attempts to minimise disruption.\\n'We recognise the right to a peaceful protest, however there are safety concerns as the sole entrance and exit point to the distribution site has been blocked and this is causing significant disruption to businesses, which we are taking seriously.\\n'We have asked the small group of activists to remain mindful of road users and in particular emergency vehicles and will continue to maintain an open dialogue with them.\\n'We would like to thank the public and the local businesses affected for their patience and understanding while this protest continues.'\\nMeanwhile, McDonald's fans and Animal Rebellion critics have hit out at the demonstrators on Twitter.\\nOne wrote: 'I absolutely support people's right to choose a plant based diet, but forcing your choices and beliefs on others is not the way forwards.\\n'There's no positive action here, this will only harm your cause. Choose to educate people on the benefits, not attempt to force an issue.'\\nAnother added: 'I mean, if you think there's a market for plant based fast food would it not make more sense to create a business model to challenge McDonald's profits rather than creating a blockade that in the long run won't change anything?'\\nMeanwhile, the Countryside Alliance also hit out at the protest.\\nMo Metcalf-Fisher, a spokesman for the Countryside Alliance said: 'Extinction Rebellion and their friends at Animal Rebellion can't get the public on side with their anti-meat crusade, so opt for these extreme stunts to get noticed.\\n'Preventing legitimate businesses and workers from carrying out their work in this way is simply unacceptable.\\n'The organisers should surely be made to pay for all damages and losses to McDonald's and to any other businesses impacted in any way by their selfish behaviour'.", "image": [["Pictured: Protestors remain on site in Coventry blocking the entrance to a McDonald's food distribution site as part of an environmental demonstration which has also seen blockades put in place in Manchester, Hemel Hempstead and Basingstoke", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/05/23/08/43331563-0-image-a-2_1621754274126.jpg"], ["The protestors are urging fast food giant McDonalds to switch to a plant-based menu in a bid to tackle climate change.

And the reason for this pathetic closure is that the Mayor, Sadiq Khan, has run out of money \u2013 despite a bone-crunching 9.5 per cent rise in the levy he charges council tax payers.\\nWhat's the point of a mayor who can't keep a bridge open? Well might you ask. But, then, what's the point of Sadiq Khan, period?\\nHe certainly isn't a big law and order man. At times during his reign, the murder rate in London has been higher than in New York. Knife crime is out of control, with incidents going up by about 30 per cent some years.\\nAdd to that the fact that robberies are up by 70 per cent and muggings by more than 50 per cent, and you get the picture.\\nIt's something he should be ashamed of, because as well as being Mayor, Khan is London's Police and Crime Commissioner. He is responsible in no uncertain terms. With his record, you'd think Khan would be out on his ear in Thursday's elections.\\nFar from it. The polls universally show him in the lead, a recent one giving him a whopping 51 per cent of the vote to the Tory's 29 per cent. And this despite the national polls putting the Conservatives ahead in the country as a whole.\\nBeyond London, the chances are the Tories will hoover up council seats aplenty and perhaps even win, for the first time, the seat of Hartlepool in a by-election.\\nBut the man widely known as Sadiq No-Khan-Do will sail home.\\nThis is partly, of course, because the Tories have run a lamentable campaign. Their inert candidate Shaun Bailey is even lagging behind Khan on law and order, according to one poll. Quite an achievement.\\nBut crime is only the first count on the long record of failure Sadiq Khan has racked up since 2016.\\nTransport for London, the Khan-run agency responsible for London's sclerotic bus, rail and road system is now running a deficit of almost \u00a31 billion, because of Khan's misconceived fare freezes, which cost a fortune.\\nTfL's biggest project, Crossrail, has been delayed from a 2018 projected completion, to 2022 \u2013 with a cost over-run of more than \u00a34 billion. So far.\\nKhan has extended the Congestion Charge across London and increased the cost despite promising not to do so during his previous election campaign.\\nThe misfiring Mayor wants to introduce rent controls, another back-to-the-future policy, which has failed every time it has been tried. Rent controls are well known to be the best way to destroy a city \u2013 short of bombing it.\\nBy way of distraction from his serial failures, Khan resorts to meddling in other policy areas that have nothing to do with his role as Mayor.\\nRemember when he wanted London to have a get-out-of-Brexit card, so it could, in effect, remain a quasi-member of the EU? Pathetic and futile in equal measure.\\nHis latest big idea is to legalise cannabis. That was old hat when I was young, and I haven't been young for decades.\\nWhy then is such an obviously superficial chancer regarded as unbeatable? I'd love someone in authority in the Tory Party to give me the answer.\\nMeanwhile, I have more personal reasons for wishing rid of Mayor Khan.\\nLast Saturday, we were advised that Extinction Rebellion anarchists might appear in our garden near the river for a 'this land is our land' protest.\\nThe purpose of this invasion? They wished to distribute literature denouncing private ownership and so on.\\nJust the latest XR nonsense in what has become their favourite city, London. Why do they love London so much? Because Mayor Khan is a sympathiser, and has said so. He shares their 'passion'.\\nI don't.\\nKhan does little or nothing to protect the citizens he supposedly serves, confining himself to a few sotto voce denunciations.\\nThe police, taking their lead from their Crime Commissioner, are equally ineffective.\\nThen there are the road changes which have been introduced under the cover of Covid-19 \u2013 some of them illegal.\\nA jumble of ill-judged cycle lanes and unpopular car-free zones \u2013 not to mention bizarre bus stops in the middle of the road \u2013 is bringing London to a juddering halt.\\nIt will take years to reverse all this, even if Londoners could bring themselves to elect a Mayor who actually wanted to do so.\\nLondon is a great business centre and needs to remain so more than ever in this confused post-pandemic, post-Brexit world.\\nBut how can it do so, if people can't get around?\\nLondon thrives on energy and entrepreneurism. Khan supplies neither of these, and is manifestly out of sympathy with all the dynamic that has made London such a success.\\nAs I write this, I am looking through my window at the dull, grey office by Tower Bridge where our dull, grey Mayor hangs out.\\nBut not for much longer. He's having to move out further east, because his near-bankrupt administration can't afford the upkeep of Ken Livingstone's old palace.\\nKen makes for an unsettling contrast with the current occupant, of course. Ken was Mayor in the days when there was actually some competition for the job.\\nI like and respect Ken, as it happens. I did a radio show with him for six years, and you got a different Ken then, just as you actually did in most of what he did in office.\\nKen was a controversialist. The sayings of Red Ken became a national joy, offending and amusing millions. No one didn't know who Ken was.\\nBut Ken was also managerial. In fact, he loved that side of things and did it rather well. He wouldn't let his political prejudices get in the way.\\nWhen public transport ogre Bob Crowe sadly died, Ken paid a rather eloquent tribute to his fellow Left-winger before concluding that 'he never got any change out of me'.\\nBob Crowe had little interest in an efficient, cost-effective public transport system, whereas Ken, whatever his political sympathies, most certainly did.\\nWhat does Khan want? Aside from power, who knows?\\nHe will be remembered for just two things \u2013 passing the buck and getting next to nothing done.\\nKhan was a human-rights lawyer, of course. Most people despise lawyers, and lawyers themselves despise human-rights lawyers.\\nYet that won't prevent a second term in office.\\nGreat cities have no automatic right to greatness, however loud they shout.\\nCast an eye towards America and the catastrophe overwhelming Los Angeles. Or the grim decline of New York \u2013 another city with global pretentions that can't mend its bridges.\\nIt's a dangerous state of affairs when London can become a one-party state so detached from the nation it supposedly serves.\\nAnd it's an indictment of our politics that such a self-serving nonentity is bound to succeed with so little scrutiny.", "image": [["Sadiq Khan certainly isn't a big law and order man.

When even world leaders are cowed into supine silence by cancel culture, it's time to stand up to the howling woke mob and tell them we're not playing by their stupid intolerant rules anymore", "subtitle": ".", "text": "I witnessed a truly terrifying moment of television this morning.\\nA moment that exposed the true insidious nature of the appalling cancel culture enveloping our world.\\nIt came on Good Morning Britain, the show from which I recently cancelled myself after refusing to apologise for disbelieving Meghan Markle's behemoth of bullsh*t during her Oprah whine-athon.\\nAnd it emanated from the mouth of Tony Blair, a man who won three terms as British Prime Minister.\\nBlair has many faults, not least his career-defining, reputation-slaying decision to unite with President George W Bush on the catastrophic war in Iraq.\\nBut one thing I've always admired in him is his willingness to speak his mind, however sensitive the subject.\\nUntil now.\\nScroll down for video\\nThis morning, he was quizzed by his own former Downing Street communications chief Alastair Campbell, the man temporarily sitting in my vacated GMB seat, about comments he had written about him in his memoirs.\\nCampbell, who suffers from depression, told Blair: 'You said that there are two types of crazy people, there are crazy people who are just dangerous, and there are crazy people who are creative and give you energy and ideas, and that's Alastair's type of craziness.'\\nThen Campbell took his old boss and close friend to task for his use of language.\\n'Do you accept that's a tad stereotyping of mental health?' he scolded.\\nInitially, Blair tried to make a joke of it.\\n'Yes,' he replied, 'but it's probably better than if I'd put you in the former category.'\\nBut then Blair, who is 68, added: 'I am afraid I am of an age where I am now terrified if I can talk about any of these subjects that I am going to say something that I should not say. It is a minefield on virtually everything. If you are of a certain generation, you are not sure what you can or what you can't say. Or whether you can make a joke about something you cannot make a joke, so I will leave it at that.'\\nI was absolutely stunned.\\nHere was one of the most famous world leaders for the past 50 years bowing to the woke mob and admitting he dare not say what he thinks for fear of being cancelled.\\nBlair may as well have taken both knees to them while he was at it and begged for pre-emptive mercy lest he say anything in the rest of the interview that might upset them.\\nThere were several ironies to this humiliating spectacle.\\nThe first is that Campbell has previously called himself 'crazy'.\\nIn an interview with UK tech firm Plexal, he said: 'There is no better feeling than that energy that you have when you're a bit kind of crazy and a bit manic.'\\nSo, he only seems to object to stereotypical mental health language when it is other people using it, the same kind of hypocrisy we see all the time from those woke warriors Meghan and Harry who love to preach about equality and climate change from their Californian mansion and private jets.\\nThe second irony is that Blair has just penned a brilliant piece in New Statesman magazine about the dangers of cancel culture in which he urged liberal leaders to stand up to it and stop 'being backed into electorally off-putting positions' on cultural issues like transgenderism.\\nBlair wrote: 'A progressive party seeking power which looks askance at the likes of JK Rowling is not going to win. Progressive politics needs to debate these cultural questions urgently and openly. It needs to push back strongly against those who will try to shout down the debate.'\\nBlair explained the inherent self-harming danger of intransigent wokery in a way that should make President Biden sit up and take notice as he's repeatedly dragged towards it by people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\\n'There is a big culture battle going on,' Blair said. 'Progressive folk tend to wince at terms such as 'woke' and 'political correctness', but the normal public knows exactly what they mean. And the battle is being fought on ground defined by the right because sensible progressives don't want to be on the field at all. The consequence of this is that the 'radical' progressives, who are quite happy to fight on that ground, carry the progressive standard. The fact that it ensures continued right-wing victory doesn't deter them at all. On the contrary, it gives them a heightened sense of righteousness, like political kamikaze.'\\nBlair perfectly articulated why the woke mentality is so alienating to most voters: 'People do not like their country, their flag or their history being disrespected,' he said. 'The left always gets confused by this sentiment and assume this means people support everything their country has done or think all their history is sacrosanct. They don't. But they query imposing the thinking of today on the practices of yesterday; they're suspicious that behind the agenda of many of the culture warriors on the left lies an ideology they find alien and extreme; and they're instinctively brilliant at distinguishing between the sentiment and the movement. They will support strongly campaigns against racism; but they recoil from some of the language and actions of the fringes of the Black Lives Matter movement. You could go through the entire litany of modern causes and find the same \u2013 from Extinction Rebellion to trans rights to Reclaim the Streets \u2013 in the same way. People like common sense, proportion and reason. They dislike prejudice; but they dislike extremism in combating prejudice. They support the police and the armed forces. Again, it doesn't mean that they think those institutions are beyond reproach. Not at all. But they're on their guard for those who they think use any wrongdoing to smear the institutions themselves. And they expect their leaders to voice their own opinion, not sub-contract opinion to pressure groups, no matter how worthy.'\\nBlair concluded: 'The correct course for progressives on culture questions is to make a virtue of reason and moderation. To be intolerant of intolerance \u2013 saying you can disagree without denouncing. To seek unity. To eschew gesture politics and slogans. And when they're accused of being insufficiently supportive of the causes \u2013 which is inevitable \u2013 to stand up for themselves and make it clear they're not going to be bullied or pushed around. This will lose some votes among a minority with loud voices; but it will bind the solid but often silent centre to them. And, of course, it will allow the causes themselves to be effectively pursued, as the last (UK) Labour government did with its own revolution in gay rights and the pathway to equal marriage \u2013 and the forced conversion of the Conservative Party on the issue.'\\nBlair's lengthy article was one of the best things I've ever read about the menace of woke cancel culture, and all the more powerful coming from a liberal leader who enjoyed huge electoral success.\\nHe knows that with the exception of Biden's 2020 election win over Donald Trump, which was almost entirely down to the pandemic and Trump's woeful leadership during it, most liberal parties around the world have been losing power and support.\\nAnd he also knows it's the hard-left woke nonsense that is driving many traditional liberal voters to vote for populists like Trump in 2016 and Boris Johnson in the UK in 2019.\\nBiden, and every other liberal leader, should heed his warning as a matter of urgency.\\nBut perhaps the biggest powerful message Tony Blair could have possibly sent about woke cancel culture was contained in his own abject surrender to it on Good Morning Britain today.\\nIf someone who's run a country like Britain for ten years, a place built on freedom of speech and expression, is now too scared to even speak out about things like mental health, race or gender, lest he upsets the woke mob, then the mob's battle is nearly won.\\nShame on you, Mr Blair.\\nThis is not a time for such surrender, it's a time to practice what you preached in your New Statesman piece and take the fight to these insufferable, intolerant, increasingly oppressive woke numpties.\\nI met an 80-year-old Australian lady on my morning walk in West London a few days ago who stopped me to say I had her full support over the Princess Pinocchio debacle.\\n'I loathe these self-righteous so-called woke people telling us what to do, say and think all the time,' she declared. 'You can't have an opinion or joke about anything anymore or they get mortally offended and want you ruined. They're sucking all the fun out of life.'\\nI couldn't have put it better myself.\\nEnough of this crap.\\nIf we don't rise up to stop the ever more frenzied woke insanity, it will drown us all in a tidal wave of opinion-devoid, humour-defunct, preaching, virtue-signalling blandness and that's not a place I think most of us want to wash up.\\nI'm heading for the culture war beach with my metaphorical bayonet to stop these imbeciles from wreaking even more damage on society.\\nWho's with me?", "image": [["Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is 68, added: 'I am afraid I am of an age where I am now terrified if I can talk about any of these subjects that I am going to say something that I should not say.

Whether something constitutes damage is therefore a matter of fact and degree.\\n\u2018As such it is a matter for us, applying our common sense, to decide whether any damage was in fact caused to the speed gates.\\n\u2018That damage need not be permanent or even long-lasting.\\n\u2018It is argued on behalf of Miss Ditchfield - an argument adopted by Miss Morris-Evans - that even if we are satisfied that the appellants left behind the marks on the gates we should not find that those marks constitute damage for the purposes of this offence.\\n\u2018It is submitted that where someone is exercising their rights to freedom of expression and freedom of protest under the ECHR - as these appellants clearly were - we should interpret damage restrictively so as to exclude anything which might be said to be minimal, temporary, or transient.\\n\u2018There is in fact no direct authority in support of this proposition.\\n\u2018The next question is whether the prosecution have proved that the defendants intended to cause damage to the speed gates or were reckless as to whether such damage be caused.\\n\u2018Having heard both appellants give evidence and having listened to closing submissions there appears to have been a fundamental misunderstanding on the part of the appellants as the test that must be applied.\\n\u2018This risk is not that permanent damage might be cause, simply that some damage be caused.\\n\u2018This is not a case where we necessarily question the integrity of the account given by either appellant. However, we do take the view that this appeal is based upon a fundamental misconception of the law.\\n\u2018We find that the application of glue to speeds gates is capable of constituting damage.\\n\u2018We further find that both appellants were aware of the risk of such damage being caused, however temporary in nature.\\n\u2018Accordingly, these appeals are rejected.\u2019\\nFormer teacher Morris-Evans said: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t have persisted, and come here today to take up the time of many learned men at significant financial risk, if I didn\u2019t strongly believe that, given that the criteria for criminal damage require at least an awareness of a risk of damage, and given that that I had sound reasons to believe there was no risk and therefore do not meet those legal criteria, I should be found innocent of criminal damage in the eyes of the law.\u2019\\nWill Durrands, for Ditchfield, said: \u2018These women were exercising their convention rights through their protest.\\n\u2018I do not imagine it is in dispute that this was a protest, those involved were exercising their rights of freedom of assembly and expression - and that they were doing so in a peaceful way.\\n\u2018This is highly relevant in the context of temporary or minimal damage - in that for a period, there was glue on the surfaces that had to be cleaned off - and could be cleaned off easily.\\n\u2018It was their intention to disrupt 33 Cavendish Square until and unless the AGM was cancelled, it was then their plan to detach, clean up and leave. The plan was never to damage.\\n\u2018In their mind was GCM\u2019s imminent plan to construct the Phulbari Coal mine in agreement with Chinese companies.\\n\u2018In their mind was the immediate human and natural cost of this project on the hundreds of thousands of people who live in the Phulbari region.\\n\u2018For these reasons, I invite you to allow this appeal and quash these convictions.\u2019\\nMorris-Evans, of Kentish Town, north London, and Ditchfield, of Cambridge, were both ordered to pay prosecution costs of \u00a3300.", "image": [["Shulamit Morris-Evans (centre) and Angela Ditchfield (left) glued hands to gates where Global Coal Management was hosting its annual general meeting, causing \u00a32,152 worth of damage", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/15/20038912-7600715-image-a-17_1571753691252.jpg"], ["Pictured: Extinction Rebellion protesters Shulamit Morris-Evans (L) and Angela Ditchfield (R) pictured with Amy Pritchard standing outside London Magistrates' Court at an earlier hearing", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/05/10/14/42799582-9562249-image-a-5_1620652610457.jpg"], ["Morris-Evans pictured with other XR protesters alongside her during an XR demonstration", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/05/10/14/20038910-9562249-Representing_herself_Morris_Evans_said_There_was_a_company_not_o-a-7_1620652791865.jpg"], ["The primary school teacher who glued herself to offices used by a coal firm justified her actions in court because fossil fuels 'passes a death sentence on many people', she claimed", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/05/10/14/20038908-9562249-The_primary_school_teacher_who_glued_herself_to_offices_used_by_-a-6_1620652782002.jpg"]], "author": ["Katie Feehan For Mailonline"], "date": "2021-05-10"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9561999/Trial-halted-XR-activist-accused-blocking-newspaper-deliveries-GLUES-dock.html": {"title": "Extinction Rebellion protesters 'demanded Sun owner Rupert Murdoch be brought to protest', police officer tells court after disruption to trial as activist GLUED himself to dock", "subtitle": "Police officer said protesters asked for Rupert Murdoch to be brought to scene.

That was Rupert Murdoch?'\\n'That was correct,' said the officer.\\nAsked if there were any specific requests from the group, the officer said: 'A request to get Mr Murdoch down to the location.'\\nPC Wilson said he relayed the request to his senior officers.\\nTim Speer, 25, one of the six who is on trial and who is defending himself, cross examined PC Wilson and put it to him that Rupert Murdoch was promoting hate speech.\\n'I just don't know why you haven't arrested him,' he told the officer.\\nHe then went on to question the officer about his understanding of the 'climate situation'.\\nInspector Matthew Barton, who attended the protest, agreed that the protest that night was about the group's concerns about the ownership of the media and the way the climate crisis was being reported.\\nPC Wilson also told the court that the effect of the blockade meant that\u00a0nothing could leave the plant or enter, and workers who had finished their shift were trapped and the transportation of newspapers away from the plant was threatened.\\nPC Wilson said members of the group told him they had been training for the protest and that he shouldn't touch the two bamboo structures because they were 'load bearing' and could topple over.\\nHis comments come after the trial of six accused was thrown into disruption at the start of the trial this morning when one of the defendants glued his hand to a table in the courtroom.\\nThe case had just been called on and the judge had taken her seat when accused, Liam Norton, got to his feet to rant in court, yelling out 'I would like to make clear what is going on in this court is obvious and complete criminality.'\\nHe went on: 'Judge, what you are going is illegal.'\\nWith the palm of his left hand on a table, he continued: 'What we have seen over decades is organised criminality in this country and unfortunately the only thing to do, as I have showed, is contempt, as you have.'\\nNorton, whose eyes were hidden behind a mask, then revealed to security staff who entered the courtroom at St Albans Magistrates Court, that in fact his flat hand on the table, had been glued to the surface.\\nAs he continued his rant against the government, cheering, singing and clapping broke out from his supporters in the public gallery.\\nHe told his supporters and others in court: 'I am left with no option but to disobey and show contempt.'\\nDistrict Judge Sally Fudge then left courtroom number six and the gallery was cleared as security staff dealt with the situation.\\nIt took two hours to free Mr Norton and he was arrested and removed from the court building and taken to Hatfield Police Station.\\nThe trial then got underway against the other five and Mr Norton in his absence.\\nThe defendants were all protesting that night because of what they say is the mis-reporting of the climate change crisis.\\nThe six due to stand trial, who were alleged to have been part of an Extinction Rebellion protest which blockaded a newspaper print works preventing the distribution of three and a half million papers, are: Liam Norton, 36, from Scarborough, Eleanor Davidson, 33, from Streatham, London, James Ozden, 35, from Tottenham, London, Tim Speers, 25, from Waltham Forest, Morgan Trowland, 38, of Hackney, London and Eleanor Bujak, 28, of Finsbury Park, London.\\nAll are charged with the wilful obstruction of the highway.\\nIn all, 51 people were charged with obstructing the highway following the blockade of the Newsprinters printworks in Great Eastern Road, Waltham Cross.\\nDuring the protest last September, activists used vehicles and bamboo lock-ons to block roads near Newsprinters' Broxbourne site.\\nA second blockade of the company's printing works in Knowsley, near Liverpool, took place on the same day.\\nThe Newsprinters presses publish the Rupert Murdoch-owned News Corp's titles including the Sun, Times, Sun On Sunday and Sunday Times, as well as the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph, the Daily Mail and Mail On Sunday, and the London Evening Standard.\\nIt meant readers were delayed in receiving, or did not receive their copies of their respective newspapers.\\nExtinction Rebellion claimed at the time the demonstration was in response to the newspapers' failure to report on the climate and ecological emergency.\\nIn his impromptu speech in the courtroom, Mr Norton said 'Society is on the brink of collapse and the Crown Prosecution Service continue to criminalise protests.\\n'Corruption is flowing through the highest levels of our system, yet our system continues to criminalise us.'\\nThe case is proceeding.", "image": [["Protesters outside St Albans Magistrates' Court, where XR activists who were arrested during blockade of News Corp
