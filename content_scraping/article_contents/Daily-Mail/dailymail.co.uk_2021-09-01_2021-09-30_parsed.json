'They will block roads. They will go on hunger strike.\\n'They will do all the things that have happened before in British history. If the Government doesn't take a lead, then there will be massive social unrest.'\\nMr Hallam set up his splinter group when he caused a rift within Extinction Rebellion over comments he made about the Holocaust.\\nHe told a German newspaper it 'was just another f***ery in human history' \u2013 but later said the remark was taken out of context from 'three seconds' of argument.\\nSources close to Mr Hallam, an organic farmer who lost his business because of severe weather, said he would 'keep escalating' his demonstrations to 'grab the headlines' from other activists.\\nOne said: 'I would be worried about what he's sitting at home planning. He has supporters who would defend him to the death. All the things people criticise them for, they are glad they did them. They think anything that gets Press attention is good.'\\nMr Hallam, 55, co-founded XR three years ago with Gail Bradbrook and Simon Bramwell, both 49.\\nExplaining the fallout, Mr Bramwell said: 'Roger is a very controversial figure and he can be difficult to get on with. But at the end of the day we both want the same thing and I have to admit that he is someone who gets things done.'\\nIn his interview with the Mail, Mr Hallam said: 'Insulation isn't the sexiest thing in the world. But it's what most ordinary people care about.'\\n'Everyone knows someone in fuel poverty, and lots of old people are in houses which are damp and cold in the winter and it kills thousands of people a year, prematurely.'\\nHe has also said he wants to 'bring down all the regimes in the world', starting with Britain, and believes those running society 'should have a bullet through their heads'.\\nThere have been allegations that he has 'cult-like' followers who liken him to Martin Luther King.\\nAccording to The Times, Insulate Britain's protest strategy revolves around the mass imprisonment of its activists, making it even more extreme than Extinction Rebellion.\\nTheir strategy this week of blocking motorways is believed to be the first in a series of disruptive actions.\\nAt a meeting earlier this year, Mr Hallam said:\u00a0'We have an absolute responsibility to go further. Five hundred people in prison will produce legislative change.\\n'Going to a bank and smashing windows [as XR have done] is not material resistance. It\u2019s symbolic and it\u2019s not going to change anything.\\n'What will change things is if fuel supplies stop, or people can\u2019t get to work in the mornings.'\\nMr Hallam believes that calls for more insulation are 'achievable and winnable', in comparison to more 'grand-scale demands'.\\nIt is calling on the Government to bring forward within four months a legally binding plan to fund insulation retrofitting by 2030.\\nIts website says: 'Improving the quality of our homes is fundamental to achieve the British government\u2019s climate change, fuel poverty and water reduction targets.'\\nHowever, Extinction Rebellion have been quick to distance themselves from Insulate Britain.\\nRepresentatives from XR reportedly contacted Surrey Police this week to complain about reports linking them together.\\nEmail tips@dailymail.com or martin.robinson@mailonline.co.uk\\nPriti Patel today summoned Met Commissioner Cressida Dick and other police chiefs responsible for the M25 after they failed to drag away protesters 'immediately' when up to 80 eco-morons blocked the motorway\u00a0for the third time in five days and also shut down the M3 and M11 as they ran riot.\\nThe Home Secretary held the emergency Zoom call after protesters from\u00a0Insulate Britain shut down the UK's busiest road during rush hour every 48 hours this week and made officers 'look like idiots', one Tory MP said.\\nThe enviro-zealots even warned officers they would do it again after being released without bail conditions on Monday and Wednesday - with Hertfordshire Police defending the decision not to charge them claiming they still need time to 'gather evidence and build a case' despite arresting dozens of them in the middle of the M25.\\nSurrey Police's Chief Constable Gavin Stephens, Kent Police's Chief Constable Alan Pughsley, Hertfordshire Constabulary's Chief Constable Charlie Hall and Essex's Ben-Julian Harrington are all in the firing line over their soft-touch response to the crippling protests.\\nA spokesman for the Association of British Drivers said: 'The police have failed to do their duty. It's time for Chief Constables to decide whose side they're on. The actions of these people is an absolute bl**dy disgrace.\\n'They should be locked away. I'm appalled about why they have been released on bail with no restrictions. Not only have police not arrested these people for proper offences - they've not charged them with anything at all'.\\nA source close to the Home Secretary told MailOnline that at today's summit with police chiefs she reiterated her message that 'these people are breaking the law and must be removed immediately'. The insider did not go into what was discussed about the M25 - and how they would break the cycle of protests -\u00a0 for 'operational reasons'. But said:\u00a0'The British public does not expect the police to be standing by while protesters disrupt people's daily lives.'\\nTory MP for South Thanet, Craig Mackinlay MP, said:\u00a0\u00a0'I am surprised that the Metropolitan Police Commissioner has not advised her officers to make use of one of numerous possible legal provisions to prevent, remove, arrest and charge the activists within Insulate Britain, Extinction Rebellion and other anarchist groups causing mayhem to the law-abiding public simply trying to go about their normal activities and costing millions in lost business and valuable police time.'\\nOne Tory backbencher told MailOnline: 'Priti's tough talking isn't enough. These protesters are making the police look like idiots and the buck stops with the Home Secretary and her chief constables'.\\nMs Patel is under growing pressure with some drivers taking to social media demanding she 'sorts this mess out' or resigns. Others said Boris Johnson should sack her if police continue to 'fail to keep roads open'.\\nOne said: 'Police - clear the f**king roads. Keep Britain moving or resign @pritipatel'. Another tweeted a picture of the police guarding the protesters and wrote: '@pritipatel - sort it or resign to let someone in who will'. One driver wrote simply: 'Resign @pritipatel'.\\nPriti Patel had ordered police to take 'decisive action' against the 'selfish' eco-protesters and described the 'guerrilla tactics' of Insulate Britain as 'completely unacceptable'. But critics have demanded to know what she will do to stamp out the problem, and halt the embarrassing cycle of protests, after the eco-warriors completely ignored her.\\nMet Commissioner Cressida Dick has been accused of 'losing control' of protests again and urged to resign just days after she was granted a two-year extension at Scotland Yard despite her critics including the parents of Stephen Lawrence and Jean Charles de Menezes saying she 'should have been fired long ago'. One Government source told MailOnline the way it had been handled by the police this week was 'mental'.\\nAs officers were shown being soft touch and drivers tried to clear the roads themselves, a Metropolitan Police officer was even filmed helping protesters to walk in front of cars and take their places at junction 25 on the M25 where they calmly sat down and blocked the road on Wednesday.\u00a0\u00a0The Met defended the officer today, saying it was for safety reasons, was a 'dynamic' decision and did not facilitate the protest.\\nBut\u00a0Insulate Britain said its 'actions will continue until the Government makes a meaningful commitment to insulate all of Britain's 29 million leaky homes by 2030, which are among the oldest and most energy inefficient in Europe'.\\n\\nIf you want to complain about the police's handling of the protests, you can contact each of the four forces involved this week by clicking on the links below:\\nSurrey Police\u00a0-\u00a0Chief Constable Gavin Stephens\\nComplaints link:\u00a0Click here\\nEmail:\u00a0surreychiefconstable@surrey.pnn.police.uk\\nMetropolitan Police\u00a0-\u00a0Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick\\nComplaints Link:\u00a0Click here:\\nEmail:\u00a0Comm.PO@met.police.uk\\nKent Police -\u00a0Chief Constable Alan Pughsley\\nComplaints link:\u00a0Click here\\nEmail:\u00a0cc@kent.pnn.police.uk\\nHertfordshire Constabulary\u00a0- Chief Constable Charlie Hall)\\nComplaints link:\u00a0Click here\\nEmail: Charlie.hall@herts.pnn.police.uk\\nYou can also complain directly to the\u00a0Independent Office for Police Conduct watchdog - click here\\nThe mob from Insulation Britain turned up to blockade junction 28 at Brentwood at around 8.30am on Friday but officers from Essex Police were waiting for them and arrested them before they could start their protest.\\nA small number broke through but they were then dragged away within minutes and thrown into patrol cars yelling at officers about their rights and saying: 'What you are doing is illegal'.\u00a0\u00a0Irate drivers were seen rowing, jostling and even spitting at the protesters on the M11 at J8 near Stansted this morning before more Essex officers dragged the troublemakers off the road.\\nPolice were today accused of failing to do their jobs and letting the environmentalists shutting down the M25 off the hook by not arresting them for more serious criminal offences.\\nThe decision to arrest the suspects for a lesser crime such as blocking a road has meant that there has been a revolving door of eco-warriors being released and then heading straight back to the M25.\\nOfficers have been holding them on suspicion of public nuisance and wilful obstruction offences, which police admit means 'there is no power in law to remand them'.\\nThese crimes are often only punished with a fine from magistrates - and suspects are rarely held in custody.\u00a0Instead there are more serious offences that could keep suspects in custody for longer.\\nThe first is Breach of the Peace, which can be used as a reason for arrest 'if the consequence of your actions provoke others to use violence and the police reasonably believe a breach of the peace is about to happen, they can arrest you to prevent it'.\\nMost people arrested for breach of the peace are held until the threat of a breach of the peace is over. In rare cases police can take a detainee to a magistrate's court to seek a 'bind-over' - an order from a magistrate from the defendant that the suspect will keep the peace for a proportionate period of time\\n\\nThe other offence, used in anti-fracking protests in the past is 'obstruction of an officer', which includes doing an act that forces the officer away from their duties.\u00a0\u00a0This could be used on those who glued themselves to the highways.\\nPolice arrested a large number of the Insulate Britain activists under this law, but no one has been charged. There were also arrests for the common law offence of public nuisance, and conspiracy to cause danger to road users under section 22A of the Road Traffic Act 1988.\\nHertfordshire Police said in a statement: 'With the offences they were arrested for on Monday there is no power in law to remand them. They will face a court when the CPS have agreed that there is sufficient evidence to charge them with an offence, for which we need to gather evidence and build a case, considering the actions taken by all the protesters'.\\nObstruction of a British road 'without lawful authority or excuse' is an offence under Section 137 of the Highways Act 1980.\\nPolice arrested a large number of the Insulate Britain activists under this law, but no one has been charged. There were also arrests for the common law offence of public nuisance, and conspiracy to cause danger to road users under section 22A of the Road Traffic Act 1988.\\nIf police had been given the Crown Prosecution Service's go ahead, they could have charged the activists with the obstruction offence and sent them to a magistrates' court where they could be punished with a fine.\\nThere were also successful protests at J3 and J9\u00a0of the M25 as well a group at J1 of the M3. Some threw blue paint on the road, which led to police deciding to shut junctions for even longer to clean it off.\\nOne protester called\u00a0Sandy, 31, who works as a teacher, told The Sun Online: 'On Monday and Wednesday there was a lot of screaming at us from motorists. Today, we're well protected by the police and there's less opportunity for it.'\\nThe activist said she had now been arrested three times next week, adding: 'I feel calm. It's out of my hands now. If I'm released, I will come back here. Losing my job is a small concern compared to what's coming if we don't lower our carbon emissions.'\\nAnother activist Oliver, 41, from London, added: 'The police wouldn't interview us when they arrested us earlier this week - they all just released us with no bail conditions. I told two officers I was going out to commit the crime again. They just advised against it.'\\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps urged police to take 'swift action to clear the roads'. He wrote on Twitter: 'This is dangerous and counterproductive. We all agree that climate change must be tackled, but this sort of behaviour achieves nothing, puts drivers at risk and INCREASES pollution. I expect the police to take swift action to clear the roads.'\\nOne officer holding two young women by the arms told them 'not to move' or they would go into cuffs. Several of the people arrested have been held for the third time - and were filmed being dragged off the road within minutes, rather than the hours it has taken earlier in the week.\\nBut Surrey Police failed to stop them doing the same for the third morning today, with a group now sitting on the junction 9 sliproad with long queues already building\u00a0on the main carriageway. They also dumped blue paint on the highway.\\nThey were are also at junction three at Swanley in Kent while a group also popped up at junction 1 of the M3, at Sunbury and at junction 8 of the M11 near Stansted.\\nThere is anger that they have been repeatedly arrested then released.\\nHertfordshire Police said in a statement: 'With the offences they were arrested for on Monday there is no power in law to remand them. They will face a court when the CPS have agreed that there is sufficient evidence to charge them with an offence, for which we need to gather evidence and build a case, considering the actions taken by all the protesters'.\\nIt came as\u00a0Priti Patel\u00a0last night ordered police to take 'decisive action' against the 'selfish' eco-protesters and described the 'guerrilla tactics' of Insulate Britain as 'completely unacceptable' after the eco-group held traffic at four of the busiest junctions of the M25 on Wednesday. They shut five on Monday and at least two so far on Friday.\\nMs Patel said the police had the Government's full support. But she warned: 'They must uphold the law and take decisive action.\u00a0This kind of disruption is dangerous and takes police away from communities where they are needed most.'\\nShe also took warned the Government would 'not allow selfish protesters' to disrupt the lives of Britons, adding:\u00a0'Peaceful protest is a cornerstone of our democracy and there will always be space for legitimate groups to make their voices heard.\\n'But this Government will not stand by and allow a small minority of selfish protesters to cause significant disruption to the lives and livelihoods of the hard-working majority.\\n'The guerrilla tactics used by Insulate Britain detract from their cause and I know the public will agree that the scenes on the M25 this week were completely unacceptable.'\\nMs Patel also\u00a0vowed to target disruptive protests such as Insulate Britain's with the Government's new Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts bill.\\nUnder the proposals, which are due to go before the House of Lords next week, police will be given greater\u00a0powers to impose conditions on protests, allowing officers to close down demonstrations quicker.\\nAstonishing footage has emerged showing a Metropolitan Police officer stopping traffic to help an eco-mob onto the M25 before they brought Britain's busiest road to a standstill for the second time in three days.\\nIn the footage, from Junction 25 of the motorway on Wednesday, the officer waved through traffic to clear a backlog before stopping vehicles to allow protesters to walk out into the road and sit down.\\nThe Met Police defended its tactics and told MailOnline that the officer was concerned for the 'safety of the group' and was not 'facilitating' the protest.\\nA spokesperson said: 'We are aware of video footage showing an officer deployed as part of our response to the protests on the M25 on Wednesday, 15 September. The footage shows a portion of the entire interaction between the officers and protesters, and not the entirety of the police intervention.\\n'The officer made a dynamic risk assessment given concern of the intention on the part of the protesters to enter onto a fast moving road which would have rendered them and others to danger. In doing this, the protesters were moved to a safe area where they were arrested shortly after.'\\nHowever, the footage appears to make a mockery of\u00a0Priti Patel's order for police to take 'decisive action' against the 'selfish' eco-protesters.\\n\\nOrganisers who breach conditions will face up to six months in prison, while fines of up to \u00a32,500 will be handed out to those who take part in 'illegal' protests.\\nBy Midday police had arrested at least 58 protesters after they blockaded the M25 for the third time in a week.\\nKent Police confirmed it had made 10 arrests of activists who had blocked the M25 exit slip road at Junction 3 at the Swanley Interchange.\\nOfficers were called at around 8.20am today/yesterday [FRI] to reports that protesters were obstructing the road at junction 3 of the Swanley Interchange.\\nThe activists were arrested and remain in custody.\\nSurrey Police said it had made 14 arrests in connection to the protest at Leatherhead and 10 at the M3 interchange and 10 arrests at junction 1 of the M3.\\nEssex Police said a total of 24 people had been arrested - 15 on the M25 and another 9 people on the M11.\\nActivists were pictured sat in a line across the road, wearing fluorescent orange hi-vis vests and holding 'Insulate Britain' banners.\\nIn Essex, officers prevented 12 protesters from the campaign group from making it onto the road at the Brook Street roundabout near Brentwood.\\nBut a further eight climate protestors managed to partially block the road.\\nFurther activists blockaded the M11 at the junction with the A120 in Essex.\\nEssex Police said a total of 24 people had been arrested - 15 on the M25 and another 9 people on the M11.\\nIt is the third time this week that activists have blocked the UK's busiest road - causing commuters heavy delays.\\nInsulate Britain said many of the protestors had only been released by police hours before they returned to the roads.\\nIt comes as members of the eco-group warned officers they would do it again after being released the first time and\u00a0vowed to hold a third protest\u00a0'as soon as possible' in another humiliation for soft-touch police.\\nInsulate Britain also revealed that officers have only bailed 17 of the 181 activists - many of whom have already been arrested on two occasions - meaning that they are free to try to block Britain's busiest motorway again.\\nIn a statement the group, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion demanding Boris Johnson pays for all social housing to be fully insulated, said: 'People from Insulate Britain involved in blocking the M25 on Wednesday and released from custody this morning told the police that they would repeat the protest as soon as possible.\\n'In the early hours of this morning, 89 people were released from several different custody centres across South East England, despite informing officers of their intent to continue taking action until the government gets on with the job of insulating the nation's leaky homes.\\n'The majority were released (yesterday) without bail conditions. Some were released despite having broken bail conditions imposed on Monday which prohibited their return to the highway.\\n'Before being released from custody (yesterday) the campaigners handed the police a clear personal statement of their intent to continue taking action until the government agrees to their demands. They were told by police that the statements would be held 'on their files''.\\nAmong those who shut down the M25 at its busiest junctions twice in 48 hours despite being arrested were Cameron Ford, a 30-year-old carpenter, and climate activist and retired doctor Bing Jones. Other ringleaders included an organic farmer who compares himself to Mahatma Gandhi, a puppeteer, a vegan 'business coach' and a 'rebel' IT project manager.\\nPolice meanwhile have been accused of failing to enforce the law after it was revealed that eco-extremists arrested for shutting down the M25 during the Monday morning rush hour were simply set free without bail conditions and allowed to do the same 48 hours later as officers again 'stood around for hours before doing anything'.\\nOne officer sparked outrage after she addressed a group of activists breaking the law by blocking the road and told them: 'If you have got any questions at all just ask. And if any of you are in any discomfort or need anything just let me know and we will try and sort you out in a nice way'.\\nThere have 181 arrests in total - for offences including public nuisance, obstructing the highway and conspiracy to cause danger to road users - but that figure includes those held twice in three days.\\nSurrey Police said officers made 33 arrests at Junctions 8 and 10 for offences including public nuisance, obstructing the highway and conspiracy to cause danger to road users.\\nOf these arrests, 12 were released under investigation, while 21 were released on conditional bail.\\nJerry Westerman, Chief Superintendent with Surrey Police, the force that made the most arrests, appealed for witnesses who may have dashcam footage.\\nHe said: 'I appreciate that these protests have caused considerable inconvenience and frustration for those caught up in the traffic delays and I can assure you that we are continuing to gather evidence and ensure that those who break the law are brought to justice.\\n'I would like to thank all those motorists who got caught up in the delays, both yesterday and on Monday, while we dealt with the incident, for their co-operation and patience.\\n'We are continuing to appeal to anyone who witnessed either incident or anyone with any dashcam footage to come forward as you may be able to help us progress our investigation.'\\nThe Met meanwhile said officers arrested 14 people at Junction 25 for obstructing the public highway, following another 17 who were involved in the previous protest on Monday at Junction 14.\\nThe force identified three people they suspect were the organisers as a 55-year-old man at an address in Walworth, a 45-year-old woman at an address in Milton Keynes, and a 49-year-old man at a location in Torquay.\\nThey were arrested for conspiracy to cause public nuisance over the first protest.\\nMet Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said:\u00a0'It is our view that this behaviour is unsafe and irresponsible, creating risk for themselves, other road users and officers.'\\nKent Police previously said officers arrested 21 people for obstructing the highway on Wednesday, and Hertfordshire Constabulary said it made 18 arrests.\\nThe Met were asked whether there were any overlaps in arrest figures given by each force, but could not confirm.\\nHertfordshire Police said 18 people were arrested for causing disruption on Wednesday - but confirmed they have already released under investigation and subject to community protection notice warnings.\\nHowever Defence Secretary Ben Wallace yesterday told LBC's Nick Ferrari that police should have acted 'more swiftly' to remove the assembled eco-mob who caused traffic chaos on one of Britain's busiest motorways.\\nHe said: 'I think that getting a swift resolution to those people sitting in the way of the M25 and not getting in the way of people, many people who are paid by the hour and don't have sympathetic bosses. Why should they lose their livelihood because somebody wants to sit in the middle of the road?'\\nOne activist involved in Monday's demo even boasted to Nick Ferrari on LBC that he had been released by police and not prevented from protesting on Wednesday, comparing the cause to that of Martin Luther King, the Suffragettes and Mahatma Gandhi.\\nFurious Conservative MPs Ian Liddell-Grainger and Craig Mackinlay slammed police for 'standing around for hours at a time before doing anything' and urged officers to 'use the powers available to them to clear this protest immediately'. Mr Liddell-Grainger backed 'much tougher sentences' for 'arrogant and stuck-up' climate anarchists who 'cause immense harm to people's lives and livelihoods'.\\n'They should have a criminal record and everybody should be made aware of the damage and misery they cause,'\u00a0Mr Liddell-Grainger raged.\u00a0'Their whole plan, of sowing chaos to our lives in this way, just won't fly with the British public because they don't kowtow to bullies.\\n'They cannot be allowed to hijack the conversation by threatening to destroy livelihoods if they don't get their own way.\u00a0If they have a grievance, they should take it up with their Member of Parliament in the lawful, peaceful way. They can't just throw a tantrum and sit in the road at whatever cost to other people.\u00a0If they can't be adults in this conversation, they shouldn't be in the conversation at all.'\\nOn Monday and Wednesday, the same protesters freely blocked motorway junctions and roundabouts across the M25, A3 and Dartford Crossing - and remained free to do so before being arrested, hours later.\\nIn total, more than 165 arrests have been made by Kent, Hertfordshire, Surrey and Met police forces over the two days of action - but every activist appears to have been fallowed to walk free from custody and return to the road.\\nA group on Twitter called UK Police Pensioners United accused officers of 'aiding and abetting' the M25 protest by 'slow reactions and decisions'. It said: 'None of the M25 forces covered themselves in glory.'\\nAsked why police had failed to act sooner, the Home Office bizarrely said the chaos was a 'cross-government' matter for both itself and the Department of Business and Energy.\\nThe climate zealots yesterday boasted of being released after their arrest and despite demonstrating on Monday they were free to cause chaos for motorists again yesterday.\\nFarmer Roger Hallam, 55, who helped found Extinction Rebellion,\u00a0before leaving to joining protest organiser Insulate Britain, wants to 'bring down all the regimes in the world', starting with Britain, and believes those running society 'should have a bullet through their heads'.\\nThere have been allegations of a 'cult-like' following for the Welshman who compares his tactics to those of heroic activists Gandhi and Martin Luther King. He is said to have been inspired to take up climate activism after his farm in Wales went bust due to bad weather.\\nIronically, Mr Hallam owns a farmhouse which was described as 'poorly insulated' in an official energy performance certificate. His 2,000 sq ft farmhouse in Carmarthen, South Wales, was given the lowest possible energy rating on the certificate. It is unclear if Mr Hallam has taken steps to improve the rating since it was issued six years ago.\\nAsked about the certificate last night, a spokesman for the group said: 'This is the point \u2013 UK homes are the leakiest in Europe, with many millions of families being unable to afford the advice and help needed to insulate the building they live in.'\\nJoining Mr Hallam was David McKenny, 38, from Cambridge, who was one of six XR protesters who 'doorstepped' TV wildlife expert Sir David Attenborough, 95, at the height of pandemic after he criticised their tactics. The group posted a letter through Sir David's door as he isolated due to his age last year.\\nVegan business coach Zoe Cohen, 51, from Lymm, Cheshire, said she joined yesterday's action to demand 'real action' from ministers. She was involved in XR's takeover of central London last month.\\nMs Cohen said then: 'We are more scared of the reality of what this system is doing to ending life on Earth and ending our future and our children's future than we are of spending a night in a cell.' She describes herself as a 'carbon literate coach' and 'XR catalyser' on social media.\\nJanine Eagling, 60, from London, helped to block the M25 and A13 junction yesterday. She has been involved with XR since 2018, helping to form blockades across Waltham Forest.\\nThe IT project manager describes herself online as a 'world citizen' and 'rebel' as well as a cyclist, walker and gardener. She has overseen IT projects at top universities and was part of a campaign to improve safety for cyclists in the capital.\\nLiam Norton, 36, a London electrician who helped organise the protest, said he was 'shocked at the lack of significant action from our Government'.\\nHe became involved in climate activism in 2018 when he helped blockade five bridges in the capital and went on to join XR's 'actions team', which is responsible for planning civil disobedience. He was convicted over blocking printing presses last year.\\nHe delayed court proceedings by gluing himself to a table. It took three hours for police to remove him and the stunt is thought to have cost the taxpayer thousands of pounds.\\nHe told Good Morning Britain: 'The government is not looking after their citizens. We are.\\n'We've got a plan to insulate Britain that gives you the best value for money in terms of reducing emissions. Hundreds of thousands of meaningful jobs will be created.'\\nAnother protester, Steve Gower, 54, from Gloucester, is unemployed but describes himself as a volunteer advocate for the homeless and is an active Unite union campaigner.\\nLast summer Gower was\u00a0ordered to pay \u00a3267 by a magistrate after he\u00a0dropped a cigarette in the street while visiting a Jobcentre. He said that the fine spiralled because he couldn't afford the reduced fine of \u00a375 and was told there was no opportunity to pay in instalments.\\nHe was joined at the M25 road blockage by Eli Rose, 26, who spent 16 days in a tree last September to protest the HS2 rail link.\\nMs Rose lived in the tree in Parliament Square because she 'cannot bear' knowing her potential future children will be born 'into a world where they will have to battle through food shortages and drought.'\\nIt comes as officers took more than two-and-a-half hours to clear off climate protesters who were obstructing Britain's busiest motorway yesterday in videos that sparked fury online.\\nIn one clip, a female officer politely tells activists: 'If any of you have any questions, or are in any discomfort or need anything, just let us know' - while stricken motorists couldn't get to work, hospitals and appointments.\\nAnother video showed an officer standing with his hands in his pockets on his own and being met with silence after asking the demonstrators which of them had organised Wednesday's protest.\\nHe then told them, 'I'm going to have to ask you to move' before awkwardly leaving.\\nMeanwhile, police had to restrain incensed truck drivers who desperately tried to move eco-warriors who had glued their hands to the road.\\nChief Superintendent Richard Liversidge, of Herts Police, said: 'Police received calls alerting us to a protest near junction 1 (South Mimms) of the A1M shortly after 8am on Wednesday. Patrolling officers were at the scene by 8.08am and were faced with a challenging situation in which protestors had blocked the carriageway and glued themselves to the tarmac.\\nAstonishing footage has emerged showing a Metropolitan Police officer stopping traffic to help an eco-mob onto the M25 before they brought Britain's busiest road to a standstill for the second time in three days.\\nIn the footage, from Junction 25 of the motorway on Wednesday, the officer waved through traffic to clear a backlog before stopping vehicles to allow protesters to walk out into the road and sit down.\\nThe Met Police defended its tactics and told MailOnline that the officer was concerned for the 'safety of the group' and was not 'facilitating' the protest.\\nA spokesperson said: 'We are aware of video footage showing an officer deployed as part of our response to the protests on the M25 on Wednesday, 15 September.

In doing this, the protesters were moved to a safe area where they were arrested shortly after.'\\nHowever, the footage appears to make a mockery of\u00a0Priti Patel's order for police to take 'decisive action' against the 'selfish' eco-protesters.\\nThe Home Secretary last night described the 'guerrilla tactics' of Insulate Britain as 'completely unacceptable' after the eco-group held traffic at four of the busiest junctions of the M25 on Wednesday.\\nMs Patel said the police had the Government's full support, but warned: 'They must uphold the law and take decisive action.\u00a0This kind of disruption is dangerous and takes police away from communities where they are needed most.'\\nThe shocking footage comes just days after Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick had her contract extended by the Home Secretary, despite widespread opposition amid a series of scandals.\\nShe has now been accused of 'losing control' of protests again and is facing further pressure to resign just days after she was granted a two-year extension at Scotland Yard despite her critics including the parents of Stephen Lawrence and Jean Charles de Menezes saying she 'should have been fired long ago'. One Government source told MailOnline the way it had been handled by the police this week was 'mental'.\\nPiling pressure on today, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps called the M25 climate protests 'dangerous and counterproductive' and urged police to take 'swift action to clear the roads'.\\nInsulate Britain protesters appeared emboldened by the apparent lack of consequences for their actions and descended on Britain's motorways for a third time today.\u00a0Around 80 blocked two junctions of the M25 for the third time in five days this morning, while another group\u00a0hit the M3 for the first time.\\nWednesday's protest was the second this week from the group, who are demanding Government action on home insulation.\\nAnd the Home Secretary claimed the Government would 'not allow selfish protesters' to disrupt the lives of Britons, adding:\u00a0'Peaceful protest is a cornerstone of our democracy and there will always be space for legitimate groups to make their voices heard.\\n'But this Government will not stand by and allow a small minority of selfish protesters to cause significant disruption to the lives and livelihoods of the hard-working majority.\\n'The guerrilla tactics used by Insulate Britain detract from their cause and I know the public will agree that the scenes on the M25 this week were completely unacceptable.'\\nDespite her strong words, protesters swarmed over motorways again this morning.\\nMs Patel also\u00a0vowed to target disruptive protests such as Insulate Britain's with the Government's new Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts bill.\\nUnder the proposals, which are due to go before the House of Lords next week, police will be given greater\u00a0powers to impose conditions on protests, allowing officers to close down demonstrations quicker.\\nOrganisers who breach conditions will face up to six months in prison, while fines of up to \u00a32,500 will be handed out to those who take part in 'illegal' protests.", "image": [["Roger Hallam wants hundreds of activists to end up behind bars during the Cop26 summit in Glasgow in November", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/17/21/48056869-10002827-image-a-109_1631911122263.jpg"], ["Police officers arrest an Insulate Britain protester who was blocking the M25", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/17/21/48056871-10002827-image-a-110_1631911127273.jpg"], ["Police arrest activists as protesters from the Insulate Britain pressure group block a roundabout near Stansted Airport", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/17/21/48056877-10002827-image-a-112_1631911137048.jpg"], ["Angry motorists argue and jostle with activists as protesters from the Insulate Britain pressure group block a roundabout near Stansted Airport", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/17/21/48056875-10002827-image-a-113_1631911141504.jpg"], ["An Insulate Britain activist is dragged off the M25 at Brentwood, Essex as they managed more protests today", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/17/21/48037389-10002827-An_Insulate_Britain_activist_is_dragged_off_the_M25_at_Brentwood-a-14_1631910294136.jpg"], ["Members warned officers they would do it again and again after being released without charge or bail conditions", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/17/21/48037383-10002827-Members_warned_officers_they_would_do_it_again_and_again_after_b-a-25_1631910294773.jpg"], ["Police arrest activists as protesters from the Insulate Britain pressure group block a roundabout on the M11 this morning", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/17/21/48038649-10002827-Police_arrest_activists_as_protesters_from_the_Insulate_Britain_-a-16_1631910294529.jpg"], ["Monday: Insulate Britain protesters took to the M25 as they caused traffic chaos for thousands of motorists", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/17/21/47955613-10002827-Monday_Insulate_Britain_protesters_took_to_the_M25_as_they_cause-a-19_1631910294569.jpg"], ["Wednesday: The same protester is pictured being detained by officers just two days later", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/17/23/47997287-10002827-Wednesday_The_same_protester_is_pictured_being_detained_by_offic-a-36_1631918985060.jpg"], ["Essex officers intercepted the eco-extremists before they could cause more congestion.

Countries will be divided into a single red list and a 'rest of the world' safe category.\\nAmong those caught up in the Stansted chaos at midnight last night was Ricardo Abreum, chief product officer at payments service ePayments in London, who urged Border Force to 'please get your s*** together'.\\nHe told MailOnline today: 'It was a ridiculous situation that happens too often. The flight landed at 11.20pm, I left the airport at 1.30am with a destination of Liverpool Street.\\nInsulate Britain protesters have caused disruption on the M25 for the sixth time in a fortnight despite injunctions which mean they could be jailed.\\nActivists from the group formed a roadblock on the slip road at junction 14 near Heathrow this morning. A total of 52 protesters arrived at about 8am and were moved to the verge by police.\\nSome glued themselves to each other barriers, and the tarmac, and blue paint was sprayed onto the road.\u00a0A total of 53 people were arrested.\\nThe group, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, is calling for the Government to insulate homes in the UK to help cut carbon emissions.\\nTheir controversial tactics have led to National Highways being granted injunctions to prevent people obstructing the M25 and A20 following further demonstrations at the Port of Dover on Friday.\\nThe injunctions mean demonstrators could face time in prison for blocking the routes. Police have made dozens of arrests since the beginning of the campaign.\\n'At that time and due to border control delays the last train was already long gone. Two options remained; getting in another huge queue to buses or calling an Uber that will charge \u00a3180 for what's usually a \u00a355 journey.\\n'This whole situation happens too frequently and it's just poor management and organisation likely hiding with excuses of Covid-19 short of staff.'\\nAcross the capital at Heathrow, Ibrahim Harb, who works in marketing, tweeted a video of huge queues shortly before 2pm yesterday, saying: 'Unacceptable queuing time in Heathrow. Some passengers have been waiting for six hours.'\\nA Home Office spokesperson told MailOnline it is 'completely incorrect to suggest there were queues of six hours at Heathrow and Stansted last night', adding:\u00a0'Throughout the pandemic we have been clear that queue times may be longer and Border Force is constantly reviewing its rosters and capacity, and flexibly deploys our staff across the airport to improve waiting times.'\\nAnd Team GB hockey player Shona McCallin posted a video from Heathrow at 8pm yesterday, saying: 'Any reason why all the desks are shut when the queue is 40 minutes long?'\\nIt comes after MailOnline revealed yesterday that the recent chaos at Britain's borders has been driven by 'nightmare' changes to guards' rotas which have forced them to work long shifts.\\nAn IT failure at Heathrow last Friday caused further problems, with thousands of people forced to wait in queues of up to three hours.\\nA Border Force official suggested that the problems are at least partly caused by changes to the staff rota which saw shifts extended by two hours in August.\\nOfficers had already had their shift lengths increased to 10 hours and 25 minutes but this was further extended to just over 12 hours, meaning that more staff have suffered from exhaustion and called in sick as a result.\\nThe unnamed staff member told MailOnline: 'The rotas are a nightmare. They made all officers extend their shifts by two hours. So an already long 10.25 hour shift became 12.25 hours.\\n'Deputy director at Heathrow Raj Johal introduced these new rosters. They are highly unpopular amongst the staff, higher officers, senior officers and including the rostering and resource management department.'\\nHe also claimed that more than 20 per cent of staff were off sick in August, whereas on a normal day the absence rate is around half that. The worker added: 'It's only going to get worse'.\\nThe Immigration Services Union backed up the staff member's claims, saying that a range of rostering issues during the Covid-19 pandemic has created 'chaos for staff and caused widespread resentment'.\\nBut a Home Office spokesman said: 'It is inaccurate to say changes to Border Force staff rotas caused a spike in sickness in August.\\n'The changes were only introduced on August 22, and were made following extensive consultation with staff and the trade unions, including the Immigration Service Union, to improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness.\\n'Our utmost priority is protecting the safety and health of the public. We will never compromise on border security and continue to fulfil our vital function of keeping the border secure and provide the resources needed to do this.\\n'Border Force regularly reviews staffing requirements to ensure resources are deployed flexibly as and when required to carry out the vital function of border security.'\\nNearly double the number of people have travelled across the English Channel in 2021 compared to last year's figures.\\nMore than 16,400 people had made the dangerous journey so far this year in small boats by Friday, according to available official Home Office data compiled by the PA news agency.\\nLast year's total was more than 8,400 - meaning this year's figure to date is closing in on doubling the 2020 total. Further channel crossings were witnessed over the weekend.\\nYesterday, a Border Force coastal patrol vessel was seen arriving in Dover full of people as well as a lifeboat with around 40 or 50 people, including families and young children, on board.\\nFrom 8am to 12.30pm, it was estimated around 150 people had arrived.

However, the fundamental truth is that the economy, the human family, needs to be disrupted.'\\nCorbynista Steve Gower was also back among the protesters on the M25 on Tuesday. The 54-year-old is one of the ringleaders and a spokesman of Insulate Britain.\\nThe group yesterday sparked fury by running out into flowing traffic on the M25 near junction 10 for Woking yesterday.\\nAfter the group boasted that: 'Some new people joined the protest this morning along with some who have participated in all five actions to date.'\\nLast night\u00a0Priti Patel and Grant Shapps\u00a0instructed officials to seek an injunction against Insulate Britain.\\nThey are said to be 'furious' at the eco-activists who ran in front of traffic during yesterday morning's rush hour.\\nPolice chiefs said the 'reckless' escalation had put motorists' lives at risk. Writing for the Daily Mail today, Home Secretary Miss Patel and Transport Secretary Mr Shapps condemned the 'arrogant' protesters and promised decisive action to stop them.\\nThe injunction is sought by National Highways and means protesters will face arrest and a potential instant jail term for contempt of court. The legal case focuses on the danger to road users.\\nPolice were accused of failing to do their jobs and letting the environmentalists shutting down the M25 off the hook by not arresting them for more serious criminal offences.\\nThe decision to arrest the suspects for a lesser crime such as blocking a road has meant that there has been a revolving door of eco-warriors being released and then heading straight back to the M25.\\nOfficers have been holding them on suspicion of public nuisance and wilful obstruction offences, which police admit means 'there is no power in law to remand them'.\\nThese crimes are often only punished with a fine from magistrates - and suspects are rarely held in custody.\u00a0Instead there are more serious offences that could keep suspects in custody for longer.\\nThe first is Breach of the Peace, which can be used as a reason for arrest 'if the consequence of your actions provoke others to use violence and the police reasonably believe a breach of the peace is about to happen, they can arrest you to prevent it'.\\nMost people arrested for breach of the peace are held until the threat of a breach of the peace is over. In rare cases police can take a detainee to a magistrate's court to seek a 'bind-over' - an order from a magistrate from the defendant that the suspect will keep the peace for a proportionate period of time\\n\\nThe other offence, used in anti-fracking protests in the past is 'obstruction of an officer', which includes doing an act that forces the officer away from their duties.\u00a0\u00a0This could be used on those who glued themselves to the highways.\\nPolice arrested a large number of the Insulate Britain activists under this law, but no one has been charged. There were also arrests for the common law offence of public nuisance, and conspiracy to cause danger to road users under section 22A of the Road Traffic Act 1988.\\nHertfordshire Police said in a statement: 'With the offences they were arrested for on Monday there is no power in law to remand them. They will face a court when the CPS have agreed that there is sufficient evidence to charge them with an offence, for which we need to gather evidence and build a case, considering the actions taken by all the protesters'.\\nObstruction of a British road 'without lawful authority or excuse' is an offence under Section 137 of the Highways Act 1980.\\nPolice arrested a large number of the Insulate Britain activists under this law, but no one has been charged. There were also arrests for the common law offence of public nuisance, and conspiracy to cause danger to road users under section 22A of the Road Traffic Act 1988.\\nIf police had been given the Crown Prosecution Service's go ahead, they could have charged the activists with the obstruction offence and sent them to a magistrates' court where they could be punished with a fine.\\n'Priti and Grant are furious that the lives of\u00a0the law-abiding majority are continuing to be disrupted by the actions of an extreme minority,' said a source.\\n'They 100 per cent back National Highways to take legal action against these individuals to ensure those who the police arrest are not released on bail and able to return to disrupting and endangering people's lives in this way.'\\nActivists were filmed making a death-defying dash on to the M25 just before 8am yesterday. Drivers were forced to slam on their brakes.\\nSome of the hardliners have been arrested five times over the past ten days, only to be released to return to block the motorway again.\\nDr Bing Jones, who has been detained by police four times, told the BBC: 'I accept that I put my life at risk. I don't really accept that we have put other lives at risk.\\n'The disruption weighs heavily on me but it is necessary.\\n'Insulating houses is by far the most cost-effective means of reducing carbon emissions within the UK and it could bring millions of people out of fuel poverty.'\\nSenior police officers said the risk to motorists was now 'very high' \u2013 yet the four forces dealing with the protests have charged only one activist.\\nSurrey Police said it first received a call at 7.57am yesterday and arrived on the scene in three minutes.\\nThe protesters held up banners saying 'Insulate Britain' and poured blue paint on the road before they were dragged away by officers.\\nBy 8.17am both carriageways were cleared and open, with 38 arrests being made.\\nAmong those involved was Sue Parfitt, 79, a retired vicar who had already been arrested at least once. An Insulate Britain spokesman said the group was aware of only one activist in custody \u2013 possibly over a breach of bail \u2013 and said no charges had been brought.\\nThey said the rise in gas prices 'increased the urgency' for change and the group would end its campaign in exchange for a 'meaningful commitment' to its demands for improved insulation in UK homes.\\nChief Superintendent Jerry Westerman of Surrey Police said the group had become 'reckless' and 'a change from what we have seen recently'.\\nWhile it is not possible to remand people in custody for obstructing the highway, he said the force was willing to 'use any kind of option to prevent crime happening'.\\nOther activists have been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, public nuisance and causing danger to road users.\\n'If we can find ways in the existing legal framework to prevent people coming back and repeatedly offending, we will absolutely use it, that is our aim, but there are some constraints,' Mr Westerman added.\\n'But we are looking at all of our options, and there may be some other things in the coming days and weeks that we are able to do that helps us in our in achieving our objectives.'\\nHis colleague Chief Inspector Mike Hodder added that the 'risk is very high when you are messing around on a motorway'.\\nA spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Service said: 'Those arrested have been released under investigation whilst the crime team fully investigate all lines of inquiry.'\\nA Surrey Police spokesman confirmed no one had been charged over the protests.\\nA spokesman for Hertfordshire Police also said it had made no charges but added that 32 people had been issued with community protection notices, which can lead to fines if not breached.\\nKent Police said Alexander Rodger, 31, from Brighton, had been charged with criminal damage. A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said: 'Offences committed at a protest are often summary only and if the police have sufficient evidence they can charge those themselves without the need to come to us.'\\nThe activists are treated individually and the offences for which each can be held are relatively minor and in most cases do not carry a custodial sentence. This means that \u2013 even if they are charged \u2013 they will not be remanded in custody.\\nWe WILL use jail to end this motorway chaos: The protesters have broken the law and alienated the public, the Government will giving police powers to stop such guerrilla tactics, say PRITI PATEL and GRANT SHAPPS\\nBut the Insulate Britain activists who have brought large sections of the M25 to a standstill in recent weeks have achieved the precise opposite.\\nThey have broken the law, undermined the cause they believe in, alienated the public, and created extra pollution, in one of the most self-defeating environmental protests this country has ever seen, particularly as we all strive so hard to rebuild after 18 months of the pandemic.\\nTransport is so crucial to that recovery. With every day that passes, our roads and railways are helping more businesses to grow, and more people to find jobs.\\nPunishing motorists to make a point about home insulation makes absolutely no sense at all.\\nAs one van driver caught up in the chaos told a protester: 'You are making people hate you.'\\nThe police have our full support to take decisive action and we're working with National Highways to take legal action against the protesters to ensure they cannot keep disrupting and endangering people's lives in this way.\\nWe are giving them powers to better manage such guerrilla tactics in future.\\nIn the medium-term, the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill will put public nuisance on a statutory footing, ensuring there are appropriate sentences for the harm caused.\\nPeople will continue to be able to make their voices heard without disrupting the lives of others. Even before the most recent demonstrations, the Metropolitan Police said that the actions of Extinction Rebellion \u2013 of which Insulate Britain is an offshoot \u2013 had cost the UK taxpayer a staggering \u00a350million.\\nThe events of recent weeks \u2013 including the cleaning of blue paint which protesters pointlessly poured on to the road \u2013 will add to that already significant drain on public funds.\\nIt is also ironic that many of the cars that have been caught up in the queues and congestion around the M25 are electric, with zero carbon emissions.\\nThere are now over half a million such cars in the UK, benefitting from one of the largest rapid charging networks in Europe.\\nWhile Insulate Britain inflicts misery in its campaign of gesture politics, this government is getting on with the job of decarbonising our transport system by 2050.\\nThousands of new charge points will encourage motorists to go electric in the coming decade as we phase out diesel and petrol. It is changes like this that make the difference, not posturing by a tiny minority who are arrogant enough to believe only they care about climate change.\\nWe all agree that climate change must be tackled. But this sort of behaviour achieves nothing.\\nIt puts drivers at risk \u2013 and idling cars actually increase pollution. While this group of eco-warriors parade for the cameras, we are getting on with the job of delivering our ambitious targets.\\nWe will not stand by and allow a small minority of selfish demonstrators to cause massive and dangerous disruption to the lives of the hard-working majority.", "image": [["Monday 13th", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/22/08/48234965-10015937-Monday_13th-a-100_1632296831264.jpg"], ["Wednesday 15th", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/22/08/48234983-10015937-Wednesday_15th-a-101_1632296831265.jpg"], ["Tuesday 21st", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/22/08/48234967-0-image-a-102_1632296831267.jpg"], ["Monday 13th", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/22/08/48234961-10015937-image-a-113_1632296936451.jpg"], ["Wednesday 15th", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/22/08/48234969-10015937-Wednesday_15th-a-112_1632296936441.jpg"], ["Tuesday 21st", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/22/08/48234955-10015937-image-a-114_1632296936454.jpg"], ["Monday 13th", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/22/08/48234971-10015937-Monday_13th-a-125_1632297188683.jpg"], ["Wednesday 15th", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/22/08/48234979-10015937-Wednesday_15th-a-124_1632297188658.jpg"], ["Tuesday 21st", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/22/08/48234973-10015937-image-a-126_1632297188687.jpg"], ["Monday 13th", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/22/08/48234977-10015937-Monday_13th-a-134_1632297270018.jpg"], ["Wednesday 15th", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/22/08/48234975-10015937-Wednesday_15th-m-133_1632297265472.jpg"], ["Monday 13th", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/22/08/48234959-10015937-Monday_13th-a-142_1632297299420.jpg"], ["Wednesday 15th", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/22/08/48234953-10015937-Wednesday_15th-m-141_1632297291479.jpg"], ["Reverend Sue Parfitt returned to the protests on Tuesday after being spotted protesting with Insulate Britain during their first protest on September 13", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/22/09/48235515-10015937-Reverend_Sue_Parfitt_returned_to_the_protests_on_Tuesday_after_b-a-150_1632297750356.jpg"], ["Reverend Sue Parfitt returned to the protests yesterday, after being spotted protesting with Insulate Britain during their first protest on September 13", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/22/09/48235513-0-image-a-151_1632297750358.jpg"], ["Corbynista Steve Gower pictured today (circled) was back among the protesters on the M25 today.

glazed sash windows.\\n'That's understandable because you have to preserve the look of a place like this but unfortunately it means the flats are inclined to get chilly in winter so you have to crank the heating up.\\n'I'm sure some people are able to insulate them more effectively than others but there's little you can do about the windows.'\\nInsulate Britain chiefs have suggested protests could continue despite the Government getting an injunction against the group.\\nGrant Shapps revealed a judge granted the legal remedy last night following a week of chaos on major highways.\\nThe Transport Secretary said the anarchists will face contempt of court and potentially be locked up if they continue their antics.\\nInsulate Britain spokeswoman Zoe Cohen was asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme if the injunction will stop the protests from taking place.\\nShe replied: 'The people taking part in these actions understand that the risks they are taking are because that we have tried everything else to make the Government protect us from the predicted impacts of climate chaos.\\n'That involves the loss of all that we cherish, our society, our way of life and law and order.\\n'We're calling for the installation and whole house retrofitting of social housing by 2025 and all homes by 2030, because this is the most effective way to reduce emissions, save lives from fuel poverty.'\\nAssistant Chief Constable Chris Noble, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for policing protests, told the programme: 'Police aren't anti-protest but we are pro-responsibility.\\n'This is not a benign supermarket car park that this is taking place on.\\n'Probably the people most likely to come to harm at the moment is probably initially police officers who are having to run across motorways to try and remove protesters as well as ironically keep them safe from themselves.'\\nMs Norton told neighbours she was going on a two week holiday, but was photographed spending it at the heart of eco-mob Insulate Britain's protests.\\nAnother neighbour said: 'It's up to her how she spends her time but you have to wonder whether those protests are going to capture people's hearts and minds or just annoy them.'\\nIn May, Ms Norton caused significant disruption in Scarborough, according to prosecutors.\\nShe was charged with wilfully obstructing a highway with an non-motor vehicle, an offence which was alleged to have taken place on Saturday May 1.\\nShe faces trial on November 5th and if convicted faces a fine of up to \u00a31,000.\\nAt a previous hearing Amber Spencer, prosecuting, told the court that the incident happened at around 11am.\\nShe said: 'Officers state that the defendant walked into St Nicholas Street in Scarborough and sat herself down in the middle of the road surface in front of some traffic lights in order to protest climate change.\\n'The defendant remained there, obstructing the highway and intentionally preventing vehicles from driving past.'\\nIt was the first bank holiday weekend after the lifting of some of the coronavirus restrictions and the protest led to a 'large number of vehicles' backing up through the town centre, the court was told.\\nTabitha Buck, acting for Ms Norton, said that she was exercising her right to protest under the Human Rights Act and challenged the prosecution's version of events.\\nShe said: 'She states that the traffic was not obstructed and that the traffic was flowing, although at a steadier pace, around her.\\n'She also submits in her defence that she was simply exercising her Article 11 right to peaceful assembly and protest and that is why she was there.'\\nScarborough MP Robert Goodwill brought the incident up in the Commons. He told MPs: 'During the spring bank holiday in May, a local labour Councillor, Theresa Norton, sat in the middle of the street, in the middle of Scarborough, on the first weekend when many of our hard pressed tourist businesses were keen to make up some of the money they'd lost during the pandemic, sat in the middle of the street and caused a massive traffic jam, supposedly demonstrating in the cause of Extinction Rebellion.\\n'That is sort of behaviour that should not be allowed to take place because it disrupts people's lives and I believe actually antagonises people against those issues.'\\nLast year she took part in an Extinction rebellion protest in Hertfordshire.\\nThe protest took place on Friday, October 9 at a site near Maple Cross where more than 20 activists spent almost 10 hours blocking the entrance of the site, as part of a co-ordinated protest across HS2 sites.\\nThe non-violent protest included erecting bamboo structures to block entrance to the site. The case was discontinued at St Albans magistrates court earlier this month.\\nAfter the decision, Ms Norton said: 'Although we are pleased the case was dismissed we are angry that the prosecution decided to continue, especially as the September trial for the final group had been cancelled, as had others previously. Disorganised and in disarray, HS2 are a disgrace.'", "image": [["Theresa Norton, 62, is a Labour councillor in Scarborough, north Yorkshire", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/23/17/48299323-10021841-image-m-24_1632414752036.jpg"], ["She told neighbours she was going on a two-week holiday before heading south to bring the M25 to a standstill (pictured above)", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/23/17/48297823-10021841-Theresa_Norton_62_is_a_Labour_councillor_in_Scarborough_north_Yo-a-25_1632414756117.jpg"], ["Neighbours claimed the draughty Edwardian seafront terrace building she lives in (pictured) is protected for conservation reasons and all windows are single glazed with Band D energy efficiency ratings", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/23/17/48297825-10021841-Neighbours_claimed_the_draughty_Edwardian_seafront_terrace_build-m-9_1632413963163.jpg"], ["She joined her son, Insulate Britain ringleader Liam Norton (pictured being arrested), for the eco-mob's protests that caused traffic chaos for tens of thousands of Brits", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/24/14/48297829-10021841-She_joined_her_son_Insulate_Britain_ringleader_Liam_Norton_pictu-a-1_1632488555241.jpg"], ["Insulate Britain ringleader Liam Norton stormed off Good Morning Britain mid-debate after a fiery clash with presenters Susanna Reid and Richard Madeley", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/23/17/48297817-0-image-a-8_1632413707071.jpg"], ["The electrician, whose eco-mob are demanding the Government pay to insulate social housing, was irked after he was called out on claims his own home is not properly insulated", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/24/14/48235731-10021841-The_electrician_whose_eco_mob_are_demanding_the_Government_pay_t-a-2_1632488555242.jpg"]], "author": ["Jacob Thorburn", "Kevin Donald For Mailonline"], "date": "2021-09-23"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9959959/Bust-George-III-African-men-removed-museum-bosses-say-reinforces-stereotypes.html": {"title": "Fury as mahogany bust from 1817 of King George III with two African men is REMOVED from museum after bosses said it was a 'hurtful reinforcement of racial stereotypes'", "subtitle": "Bust of George III flanked by kneeling African men was once a yacht figurehead.

In a statement, Surrey Police said the investigation is ongoing and that 'it is too early to know' if the crash was caused by the protest.

As a splinter group of other organisations with Marxist overtones the true nature of their protest is obvious.\\n'The police must use the powers available to them to clear this protest immediately and the courts should use their powers to grant compensation to the public and businesses affected, taking protestors to bankruptcy as necessary.'\\nMP Andrew Bridgen slammed the 'extremely irresponsible' demonstrators, saying: 'They are putting people's livelihoods and indeed lives at risk through their reckless behaviour.

I have long struggled for people's rights to protest peacefully, but they must not deny the freedoms of other people. If activists stop people on the M25 from getting into work or prevent journalists from going to their offices, then they are disrupting the nation. That is wrong, and they should not be allowed to get away with that.'\\nProtesters held signs which said 'sorry for the disruption' as they clashed with drivers stuck in the queue. One motorist told LBC: 'They are working against themselves', while others screamed abuse telling the activists 'we'll lose our jobs'.

What about the other thousands of people that are on the motorway? You've destroyed all their businesses.'\\nAnother frustrated driver said: 'Can this protest on the M25 just not?? Both days we have travelled and are traveling and they do it both those days.'\\nWhile a male driver said: 'You know the people stuck on the M25 due to protests. I'm one of them. Have just had my most public 'toilet' ever, but took a standing ovation from the traffic jam and the rubber neckers!'\\n\\nHowever, president of motoring insurance group AA, Edmund King, said that during the last Insulate Britain blockade, a thermal insulation engineer was prevented from going to work after being stuck in the traffic queue.\\nOn Wednesday he said: 'Whilst most people understand the need to take action on climate change, these motorway blockade tactics are just backfiring as they are alienating the working public stuck in this chaos and subsequently pumping out more emissions.\\n'It is somewhat ironic that thermal insulation engineers trying to insulate Britain were stuck in the congestion caused by Insulate Britain. Essential deliveries, emergency services, people missing hospital and business appointments are all hit by these blockades. Hopefully the police will take immediate action to unblock the arteries of Britain.'\\nA Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: 'We are currently dealing with an incident near Junction 1 of the A1M southbound. Officers are at the scene. The road has been closed and as a result there is some traffic congestion. Motorists are asked to please avoid the area where possible.'\\nIn a statement, an Insulate Britain spokesman said: 'The world is burning and burning, each year worse than the last. They are disrupting not just today or this week but the next hundred thousand years - for ever.\\n'This country is facing the greatest crisis ever and we are told to plant trees and do the recycling. We can take the lies no longer. We are not stupid. We are not children. We will no longer tolerate this dishonesty.

We are here to do our duty - to fulfil our responsibilities to our grandparents and their parents who gave their lives to preserve our way of life. To our children and the next thousand generations who will curse us for eternity if we do not act.\\n'We will keep going until the Government responds.'\\nThe activist speaking to LBC's Nick Ferrari said:\u00a0'The United Nations have made it very very clear that humanity is in a code red, which means that emissions - global emissions - are rising. I do believe that insulating the housing stock of the UK is the most cost-effective way to reduce those emissions.\\n'History has shown that breaking the law peacefully and causing disruption - with Martin Luther King, the Suffragettes and Gandhi - that these are the most effective tactics to get change to happen quickly.'\\nThe failure of police to immediately arrest protesters who blocked five junctions of the M25 for up to four hours sparked fury this week.\\nYesterday Richard Madeley\u00a0accused the original M25 eco mob of 'fascism' for 'blocking out reality' in an angry clash with an activist - as motorists trying to haul away protesters were called 'heroes' amid anger at the slow police response.\\nElectrician\u00a0Liam Norton, 36, who did not take part in the protest but was one of the organisers, went head to head with the Good Morning Britain\u00a0host yesterday morning as he attempted to justify the disruptive roadblocks as a means of protecting the planet.\\nHe said: 'Why do you think grannies are on the road yesterday? Why do you think that's happening? This is the way that has been proven to force the Government to act... the Government is not looking after their citizens, Richard.'\\nEmail jack.wright@mailonline.co.uk\\nBut Mr Madeley rejected the argument, saying: 'You're blocking out reality, aren't you? You're only seeing one aspect of reality.

ExtinctionRebellion'.\\nEleven demonstrators were arrested during the Tower Bridge protest on Monday.\\nIt comes after the eco-activists were today accused of jumping the shark - after targeting the headquarters of beloved wildlife preservation and environment cause the WWF.\\nThey hit the HQ in Woking at 9.30am under the explanation of it being\u00a0in solidarity with indigenous groups in Tanzania, Cameroon and Kenya.\\nAn XR spokesman claimed the groups were being evicted and persecuted by WWF's conservation activities.\\nBut the stunt was greeted by utter bemusement by most members of the public.\\nAnd MP Alexander Stafford said: 'They've completely\u00a0jumped the shark.\\n'By attacking those that work to protect the environment, halt our natural decline, & stop climate change, they have revealed their own nihilistic hand.\\n'Groups like WWF\u00a0have done far more and will do more for our planet than these extremists.'\\nThe phrase 'jumping the shark' refers to when someone does something far-fetched to try and maintain interest.\\nEarlier protesters, from offshoot Animal Rebellion, wanted dairy company Arla to transition to plant-based production by 2025 and claim they will not leave the firm's site in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, until it agrees to do so.\\nIt claims Arla emitted more greenhouse gases in 2017 than BHP, a mining company, and ConocoPhillips, an oil producer.\\nJames Ozden, a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion, said: 'The dairy industry abuses animals, the planet and workers, who are increasingly squeezed by big business.\\n'Arla say they're pro-worker but lobby for supermarket contracts that sell milk for less than water.\\n'We're not just demanding that Arla go plant-based by 2025, we're demanding that the Government supports companies like Arla by funding a just transition for workers in meat and dairy industries to just and sustainable alternatives.'\\nThe group said a climate crisis could lead to unstable crop supplies to feed dairy cows and also potentially expose them to heat stress for two months longer than usual, which could lead to a milk shortage.\\nAt London Bridge, Metropolitan Police officers eventually surrounded the vehicle atop the bridge and several streets\u00a0to stop people entering the area.\\nThe force tweeted: 'Officers are responding to a demonstration in #LondonBridge where protesters have assembled and are blocking the road.\\n'We are currently assessing the situation working to keep disruption in the area to a minimum.'\\nPedestrians coming from London Bridge Underground station were diverted away from the protest by approximately 20 officers and police vans on one road alone.\\nAn officer confirmed some people taking part in the protest were being arrested, and the road closures would be in place 'for hours'.\\nExtinction Rebellion London tweeted: 'We will leave the streets when the Government starts treating the climate emergency like an emergency.\\n'Covid showed what the Government can do in a crisis, it's the level of response required for the climate but sustained over years. #ExtinctionRebellion'.\\nEleven demonstrators were arrested on Monday, when protesters occupied Tower Bridge.\\nMore than 300 arrests have been made during the first week of Extinction Rebellion's fifth wave of mass protests in London.\\nSome 11 activists were arrested during action on Bank Holiday Monday, which saw protesters block Tower Bridge with a van and caravan.\\nIt follows 34 arrests on Sunday when demonstrators occupied the Science Museum in protest against its partnership with oil giant Shell.\\nThe Metropolitan Police said there had been a total of 367 arrests in the capital since the environmentalist group began its latest round of action, dubbed the Impossible Rebellion, on August 23.\\nThe group is demanding the Government stops investment in fossil fuels.\\nAs part of the protests, activists have blocked a road in central London with a large pink table containing built-in lock-ons, spray painted the floor outside the HM Revenue & Customs headquarters and daubed the famous Guildhall in the City of London in red paint.\\nAnimal Rebellion, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, dyed the Buckingham Palace fountains red in protest at animal hunting.\\n\\nOn Monday, activists were seen lying on the ground near Tower Bridge, while others wore aprons emblazoned with Tell The Truth and with teapots with Deniabilitea written on them.\\nProtesters were seen to be removed by officers prior to the blocking of the bridge.\\nThe Metropolitan Police said demonstrators had used 'complex' lock-ons 'to frustrate our removal efforts', and specialist removal teams were drafted in.\\nThe force said on Twitter: 'We see many comments and questions asking why this work can't be quicker and use more direct tactics.\\n'While we understand the public's frustration, we must consider the safety of everyone involved \u2013 including our officers.\\n'This work is

This includes racial discrimination, systemic corruption and the reckless and unjustified harassment of innocent people.\\n'After decades of equivocation and inertia, we are calling for immediate and decisive action from your administration. We have \u2013 reluctantly \u2013 become public figures as a result of our experiences but we are determined to use our voice to push for reform. This is the only way to restore confidence in our capital's police service, and to ensure that these injustices cannot be repeated.' They say there 'must be accountability' in the police.\\n'A system which allows the police to set the parameters of the inquiries into their own misconduct, as was and is the case after Operation Midland, is self-evidently broken,' they write.\\n'The Independent Office for Police Conduct, which is supposed to oversee complaints against the police, is demonstrably unfit for purpose as it is currently structured.\\n'A functional governance system must be established, led by a credible and legally-trained individual, and they must be given the powers to investigate and hold the police services to account. The IOPC must themselves be properly accountable to the Home Secretary with an independent oversight mechanism.'\\nThe widely-expected decision to give Dame Cressida a contract extension comes just weeks after a senior Government figure privately cast doubt on her prospects of staying in post following a string of controversies including her handling of the Operation Midland VIP child abuse inquiry scandal.\\nIn June, Dame Cressida was engulfed in cover-up claims after an official \u00a320million report branded the Met 'institutionally corrupt' and accused her of trying to thwart an inquiry into the unsolved axe murder of private eye Daniel Morgan.\\nHis brother Alastair is one of the seven figures to sign today's letter to the Prime Minister. Dame Cressida has rejected the key findings of the probe into the Morgan case, which has been mired in allegations of police corruption.\\nLast night the Home Office did not confirm Dame Cressida's contract extension \u2013 saying the process was 'ongoing'. Insiders said there was still some 'procedural stuff' to sign off before it was formally announced. Sources said there was concern about the lack of suitable replacements with one claiming it is 'a case of better the devil you know'.\\nThis claim caused bemusement in senior police circles with two well qualified chief constables understood to have been preparing to apply for the commissioner's job. Moves to give Dame Cressida two more years in charge even prompted anger from within senior Met ranks. One highly influential figure who leads hundreds of officers told the Mail: 'It's an unbelievable disgrace \u2013 what on earth is going on?'\\nAsked to comment on whether Dame Cressida should get an extra term, Baroness Lawrence said: 'I just think there's been too many mistakes that she has made in her tenure as commissioner. She's the first woman commissioner and that's good for diversity but if you're not doing your job properly then that should make no difference whatsoever.'\\nLady Brittan, whose two homes were raided by Operation Midland detectives six weeks after her husband Leon died and received \u00a3100,000 in compensation from the Met for the bungled raids, said: 'I'm not one to have personal grudges but I think that she's the wrong person.\\n'When you have an organisation that has had a certain amount of scandals, the leader has to be exceptionally good, exceptionally strong, exceptionally talented, exceptionally gifted.\\n'You have to have a lot of integrity and you also have to be very clear about, if you've got to do unpleasant things, you do them. If you're a really good leader, you don't indulge in cover up.\\n'When something horrible has gone wrong, they're able to fall on their swords because that's very often the decent thing to do, not an easy thing to do, and in our current political climate, it seems to be nobody falls on their swords.\\n'She came in with very high hopes but it may be that just for this particular time she doesn't have the skills that you need at this moment.'\\nLast month it was revealed that Dame Cressida was facing a potential misconduct probe over her open support of one of her most controversial senior officers, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Horne, who could stand trial over alleged data breaches.\\nIt was announced that the embattled Scotland Yard chief has been referred to the police watchdog over her 'public comments and alleged actions' in relation to Mr Horne.\\nAway from 'cover-up' controversies, Dame Cressida has also been under fire over her force's woeful security operation at the Euro 2020 final at Wembley this summer.\\nDespite widespread condemnation of police tactics, she has backed her officers to the hilt and tried to deflect blame for the fiasco. The Met was also condemned this year over its policing of a vigil for murder victim Sarah Everard. Officers moved in and made arrests citing coronavirus restrictions.\\nHow can their voice be ignored? From Baroness Lawrence to the wife of Leon Brittan and the son of war hero Lord Bramall, our distinguished panel \u2013 all betrayed by police failures\\nFury of Home Secretary's wife\\nLady Brittan's husband Leon was falsely accused of rape and murder by serial fantasists. Her two homes were raided by the Met's Operation Midland detectives over the lies of Carl 'Nick' Beech, six weeks after her husband, a Tory former home secretary, died in 2015.\\n'I'm actually quite interested in leadership and I think there is a difference between the way women lead and the way men lead organisations,' she said. 'But nonetheless, the principles are the same. Firstly, you cannot seek popularity. You have to have integrity. You have to have clarity of vision and if there's anything wrong with your organisation, you have to do your best to put it right.\\n'The thing I would say about the police is that they are essentially an arm of our legal system. Therefore that standard should be even higher, even less corrupt, with greater integrity and we come back also to the fact they're unaccountable. You have to have a leader in these circumstances, particularly where we're looking at a number of what we think to be miscarriages of justice. The current commissioner is probably part of the problem and not necessarily the solution. I just don't think she has the correct set of skills to do what is needed to do with the senior police force for us to have a great, respected reputation around the world.\\n'I'm sure it still thinks it has but they are the example bearers to the members of the public, who have to believe in trust in the police because they have so much power. And therefore, when you have a lot of power, you have to be doubly sensitive about how you exercise that power. And all we see is this culture of cover-up. They put their personal and organisational objectives before the pursuit of justice and the protection of the public.'\\nBBC star who won \u00a3250k Payout\\nPaul Gambaccini was arrested over false sex abuse allegations in 2013 and spent a year on bail before the case was dropped by then Met assistant commissioner Dick's Yewtree detectives. In an out-of-court settlement last year, the Met agreed to pay him \u00a3250,000 over privacy breaches.\\n'The contract of Dame Cressida Dick must not be renewed,' he said. 'I do hope that the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary would show the courage of their predecessor Theresa May in dealing with the bully. She's the only politician of either party this century who's disciplined the police. And it is up to Boris Johnson and Priti Patel to show that they have the courage of Theresa May.\\n'How can Dame Cressida say she is 'a woman of honour' when she was gold commander for Jean Charles de Menezes? You would have thought that would be a promotion-preventing debacle. For most people the past catches up with them. She is long past the point where her past should have caught up with her.\\n'Operations Midland and most of Yewtree are a complete sadistic and stupid fiasco. So we must ask the Prime Minister and Home Secretary to reform the police because it refuses to reform itself.\\n'And we must ask them to not renew the contract of Cressida Dick. Both the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary know about my feelings because I've spoken to them about it in their previous jobs. They can't plead ignorance. They must act.'\\nSon of a wronged D-day veteran\\nNick Bramall's father, Lord Bramall, a D-Day hero and former head of the armed forces, was in his 90s when his home was raided by 20 Met detectives investigating Carl Beech's VIP abuse lies. The field marshal was later twice interviewed under caution by a detective, who asked him ridiculous questions. Dame Cressida sanctioned the launch of Operation Midland in 2014 when an assistant commissioner and has been widely criticised over her response to an inquiry into the 'Nick' scandal.\\n'Most people are responsible for their actions,' he said. 'Operation Midland was a complete fiasco and my biggest complaint is that nobody has been held responsible at all, not even a smack on the wrist. And that cannot be right. I mean, this was a disaster. It put good people through a very severe ordeal, you know, to be accused of child abuse, rape \u2013 in Harvey Proctor's case, murder \u2013 I mean, it's outrageous. And you know, no one's put their hands up and they bloody well should have done.\\n'Cressida Dick's name seems to crop up with every sort of disaster that happens, so she's very much at the forefront of this. Someone should be bought to book and they should come clean. They had an internal investigation whitewashed the whole thing, it's not good enough.\\n'I often said to Dad 'What would you have done in this situation? And he said 'I would have made it my business, if I was head of the Met, to get to grips with this. I would have asked all the right questions, I would have made it my business properly to come down and see those people involved, on the quiet'. I think he would have been much more proactive.\\n'His overriding impression of the police was he couldn't really believe that they had been quite so stupid. Whether they were also corrupt is another matter. This was a really appalling thing to put people through. You can't be accused of anything worse in life really, than being accused of abuse, murder, rape, buggery. I mean, it's terrible.\\n'If my dad had overseen this as Met chief he would definitely have resigned. He was a man of honour. If he'd been shown to be incompetent or falling down on the job he would have put his hands up because he was of that generation.'\\nThe campaigning peer and mother\\nBaroness Lawrence's son Stephen, 18, was murdered by racist thugs in south-east London in 1993. Despite the initial police investigation being riddled with allegations of serious misconduct and gross incompetence \u2013 and a public inquiry branding Scotland Yard 'institutionally racist' \u2013 not one officer has been held to account. Baroness Lawrence is unhappy that Dame Cressida closed her son's murder inquiry last summer and is also critical of the Met's stop and search strategies.\\n'If you were to look at where we are now, nothing much has changed,' she said. 'We sit around the table talking about individual cases, what people have gone through and it's like they have never learned their lessons. It continues to happen and it will continue to happen. It's like we're seen as \u2013 I wouldn't say pawns \u2013 but we're irrelevant in the whole thing. The police decide they have a line that they're going to go down or not go down and then that's it, and we all should accept it. The difficulty is that they don't accept responsibility when something goes wrong. And I think if you can accept responsibility, then you stand a greater chance of not doing it again, or even trying to put it right. But they never accept responsibility, always blame the victims, for whatever wrong has happened.\\n'Back in Stephen's case they talk about one bad apple. It's more than one bad apple in the barrel. And there's nobody holding them to account. Accountability: that is what needs to happen and until we have that we're going to continue having the same thing as around Stephen's case.\\nIt's been going on for 28 years and there's still more that could come out but will it ever? I don't know if it's the Mayor of London \u2013 whoever it is that needs to look seriously around Cressida Dick. I just think there's been too many mistakes that she has made in her tenure as commissioner. And even going back. There's so many mistakes. She's the first woman commissioner. That's good for diversity, but if you're not doing your job properly then that should make no difference whatsoever.'\\nBrother of axe murder victim\\nAlastair Morgan has fought a marathon battle for police accountability since his private eye brother Daniel Morgan was murdered with an axe in 1987. The unsolved case has been engulfed with allegations of police malpractice and cover-ups. A \u00a320 million report damned the Metropolitan Police and Cressida Dick. She rejected its findings of institutional corruption.\\n'Many people in authority are very, very na\u00efve about the police,' he said. 'Unless you've actually dealt with them yourself you just cannot believe how stupid they can be, or how obstructive, or how pigheaded. There's a kind of gruesome idiocy in their manner and the way they do things. It's just so patently idiotic.\\n'You wonder what the point of the report was if it's going to have that reaction? And then what about the next report? And the next one? It's just undermining the foundations of our society to rubbish it like that.\\n'That took eight years to produce that report against all opposition from the Metropolitan Police who were putting obstacles in its way at every step.\\n'I don't think Cressida Dick is in a position of any kind of credibility. It's got to go to the Prime Minister. Whether there is the will to do anything about this is another matter.'\\nAide to 'vilified' former tory PM\\nMichael McManus worked as a parliamentary private secretary to Ted Heath and has written a respected biography of the Tory prime minister. He has been an outspoken critic of Scotland Yard's Operation Midland and Wiltshire Police's Operation Conifer, which investigated false allegations of VIP abuse and murder against Heath.\\n'There was this unilateral change of the fundamental principle of innocent until proven guilty,' he said. 'It began badly with an appeal for victims outside Ted Heath's house. He was dead. He had no family and it was up to us, those of us who had known him. What was being said about him wasn't even possible in terms of his diary, the way he lived and there was absolutely no evidence. But you had a campaign by the police \u2013 it wasn't an investigation \u2013 it was a campaign to vilify him, actively vilify him, led by the chief constable.\\n'It's about accountability. If you're not allowed to open the windows, fresh air will never get in. I see no reason why we should accept that the Met is forever going to be lions led by donkeys because that's what it is at the moment and there's no reason to accept that. To my mind, nothing has changed.'\\n\\nHarvey Proctor's home was raided by bungling Operation Midland detectives in March 2015. Accused of serial rape and murder by the fantasist Carl Beech, the Tory former MP was interviewed under caution and lost his job and home. Later received \u00a3500,000 compensation from the Met, and a further \u00a3400,000 in legal costs.\\nHe said: 'No individual officer in Operation Midland has been held personally accountable and the more I've complained, the more the Met have tried to cover up. The feeling I had from the police after the end of Operation Midland was that I was disposable and not worth them having any contact with me at all.\\n'Where there's responsibility, there is no discipline, there is no acceptance that somebody should be held personally responsible and face the same consequences that I would, being outside the police.\\n'That Dame Cressida seeks an extension of her contract after misfortune after misfortune and her own mistake after mistake and the politicians apparently seem mindful to grant her wish of an extended contract is a calamity. The dame should go now and never darken public life again.\\n'The Augean stables of New Scotland Yard need to be cleaned. The search for those with the integrity and rectitude to do it, to uncover the truth, must not be delayed.'\\nFor the sake of our lost loved ones and all the lives ruined, the Dame has to go: Divided by politics and background, but united by rage and despair, that was the clarion call from a historic and emotional meeting of minds organised by the Mail, as they laid bare torment they want to spare others\\nBy Richard Pendlebury for the Daily Mail\\nTwo vignettes will stay long in my memory after this extraordinary gathering.\\nThe first: Alastair Morgan, the Left-leaning brother of private eye Daniel Morgan, victim in 1987 of a still unsolved murder, in deep conversation with Diana Brittan, widow of Leon, the former Conservative Home Secretary and a man synonymous with law-and-order reform during the Thatcher years.\\nSomething Lady Brittan says causes Alastair to spontaneously fold her in an empathetic hug.\\nThen, towards the end of the afternoon, former Tory MP Harvey Proctor \u2014 one-time firebrand of the Right-wing Monday Club \u2014 towering over the diminutive Doreen Lawrence, Labour peer and campaigning mother of Stephen, the black teenager murdered in 1993 by a racist white gang.\\nNot for the first time today, Proctor's voice breaks with emotion. He clutches the Baroness's hand as if he will never let it go and says: 'It has been such a great honour to meet you.'\\nWhen forthright people from disparate backgrounds and of opposing political views come together one wonders \u2014 or worries \u2014 if their interaction will lead to discord and further polarisation.\\nNot in this instance. Not when those involved have suffered hurt, injustice and humiliation at the hands of the same powerful institution. Instead, something good, possibly momentous, took place.\\nOne day last week the Mail invited seven remarkable people to gather together for the first time, at a house in Clapham, South-West London. Infamously, each of them had been victim or witness to gross injustices at the hands of the police; two horribly \u2014 if not, on occasion, deliberately \u2014 mismanaged murder inquiries and the outrageous fantasies upon which Operations Midland, Yewtree and Conifer were based, destroying the lives and reputations of innocent public figures.\\nIn almost every instance responsibility for these scandals lay with the Metropolitan Police, Britain's largest force, which is led today by Commissioner Cressida Dick.\\nThe seven came together to discuss their individual experiences, to consider Commissioner Dick's desire to continue in her job when her current contract expires \u2014 and to share their thoughts on what should be done about that blind and toothless watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).\\nAt the conclusion \u2014 five hours later \u2014 not only had they found common ground but also produced the first draft of a devastating joint letter. A victims' demand for change at both the Met and the IOPC. From the top downwards.\\nNot everyone had been keen to meet. Alastair Morgan, whose brother's killing in a South London pub car park became the 'most investigated unsolved murder' in modern British policing, pulled out two weeks before the event.\\nThen he changed his mind again, at the eleventh hour. But he was still doubtful. 'I feel I don't belong here,' he told me on arrival. Within minutes the elegant Lady Brittan, who has a gift for putting strangers at ease, was giving him the benefit of her skincare regime 'moisturise, moisturise, moisturise . . .'\\nHe began to relax.\\nNick Bramall, son of war hero Field Marshal Lord Bramall who was falsely accused by Operation Midland fantasist Carl Beech (aka 'Nick'), had also felt anxious prior to the meeting. In his sharp suit and tie, the Dorset landscape gardener joked: 'The guys I work with would not recognise me.'\\nTomorrow he would be back in the potting shed. Today, he was 'here for my dad and what [the police] did to him'. Paul Gambaccini is still putting his life back together after being arrested in 2013 over unfounded allegations of sexual abuse. That morning he had recorded the next edition of his long-running Radio 2 show Pick Of The Pops, featuring hits from 1997 and 1983.\\n'The gap in sales between the No 1 and No 2 hits in 1997 was the greatest in chart history,' the 'Professor of Pop' enthused. (For the record the tracks were Elton John's Diana tribute version of Candle In The Wind and Sunchyme by Dario G.)\\n\\nBy Glen Keogh for the Daily Mail\\nThe head of the police watchdog was fighting for his career last night after his organisation was branded 'unfit for purpose' by victims of misconduct in a letter to the Prime Minister.\\nBaroness Lawrence, Lady Brittan and five others whose lives were affected by bungled Scotland Yard operations, said the Independent Office for Police Conduct was 'broken' and must be led by a 'credible and legally-trained individual.'\\nIt is headed by Michael Lockwood, an accountant and later London council chief, who has faced a barrage of criticism since taking the reins in January 2018. Accusations include lengthy delays to investigations, a dearth of knowledge among its officers and a lack of accountability.\\nMr Lockwood was accused in 2019 of 'cronyism' when he helped name his former Harrow Council deputy as his \u00a3140,000-a-year number two at the IOPC. Dame Meg Hillier, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said there were 'serious questions to be asked' about the appointment.\\nLater that year the IOPC returned its long-awaited report into Scotland Yard's disastrous Operation Midland probe. It was condemned as a 'whitewash'.\\nDespite the Met's investigation being widely considered one of the worst in recent history, all five officers accused of misconduct were cleared of any wrongdoing. Four were not even interviewed.\\nCalling for a criminal inquiry into the IOPC and the Metropolitan Police, retired judge Sir Richard Henriques, who carried out a review of Operation Midland, said the watchdog had 'failed in its duty to investigate'. He described its report as 'lamentable'.\\nIn an unprecedented move, six former home secretaries supported his call for an independent inquiry into the IOPC and the police, agreeing that public confidence in the watchdog had been 'seriously damaged'.\\nFor its probe into Midland, the IOPC appointed Kimberley Williams as lead investigator. Just a few years out of university, she admitted when taking statements that she was not legally trained and was not fully aware of the process for obtaining search warrants.\\nQuestioned by MPs over Midland, Mr Lockwood denied 'mishandling' the investigation and insisted: 'Mistakes were made but there was no misconduct.'\\nThe letter of complaint to the Prime Minister said: 'The IOPC, which is supposed to oversee complaints against the police, is demonstrably unfit for purpose. A functional governance system must be established.'\\n\\nBaroness Lawrence arrived wearing a floral dress and blue blazer with a United Nations lapel badge. A mother figure in every sense, she was, throughout the afternoon, encouraging, comforting, inclusive, wise. One noticed the hand she placed on Lady Brittan's shoulder as they posed for a photograph. No accident.\\nShe told me about waiting to make her maiden speech in the House of Lords.\\n'I didn't know the rules,' she said. 'So I asked: 'Who do I follow and this [lord] said, 'You should know your place.' ' As a working-class black woman, Doreen's place was clearly thought by some not to be in the Upper House. Later, she would tell the gathering: 'People in authority believe you should act in a certain way as a black woman . . .but I would challenge them and they did not like me doing that.'\\nHarvey Proctor, falsely accused of grotesque sex and murder offences by Carl Beech \u2014 because of which he lost both his job at Belvoir Castle and his home on the estate \u2014 was last of the seven to arrive.\\nTall and slightly stooped, 74- year-old Proctor has always been a snappy dresser. His polka-dot tie \u2014 with matching pocket square \u2014 bore the label 'Proctor's' 'From when I had my shirt shop in Richmond,' he said.\\nDespite being exonerated, his life is still in flux and he has had to move homes because of a credible death threat. 'Those threats won't stop, of course,' he added.\\nThe seven took their seats around a table to begin a more formal, recorded discussion of the issues, chaired by my colleague Stephen Wright. Having fought for justice longer than anyone else present, Alastair Morgan was the first to speak. He was asked to share his thoughts on Commissioner Dick's rejection, earlier this summer, of the incendiary finding of an independent panel investigation into her force's failure to punish his brother Daniel's killers: that the Met itself had been guilty of 'institutional corruption'.\\n'To be honest I wasn't surprised,' he said. 'I have had to deal with the police for 34 years now and I have been lied to all along.'\\nThe next two and a half hours were deeply moving, revelatory and shocking; a shaming litany of police failure, inexplicable credulity and malpractice, set out by those who suffered it at first hand in some of the most notorious cases in the past four decades. It didn't matter what party they voted for or whether they lived in castles or on council estates. They knew that those at the table had endured what they had, too. There was a tangible rapport \u2014 and anger \u2014 which grew by the minute.\\nBaroness Lawrence followed Mr Morgan. She spoke of the betrayal her family suffered in the immediate aftermath of Stephen's murder. 'The police [family] liaison officers were not there to give us information . . . they were there to spy on us,' she said. 'They were looking for background to discredit us. But there was nothing in our closet for them to find.'\\nLady Brittan nodded in sympathy and recognition. 'A dying dog would have been treated better [by the police] than the way they treated my [terminally ill] husband,' the gathering was told.\\nShe used to have the deepest respect for the Met but 'now I almost do not believe anything they say . . . Unless you have [change] there is no point in having an apology.'\\nMr Proctor apologised for not speaking off the cuff. He had, he said, fallen out of practice since leaving Parliament following a gay sex scandal in 1987. Instead, he read a prepared statement.\\nBy way of opening \u2014 as Baroness Lawrence and Nick Bramall would do later \u2014 he paid tribute to this newspaper's campaigning. And in particular the 'courageous and forensic reporting' on policing matters over three decades by Stephen Wright.\\nThis had, he said 'restored my faith in British journalism'. 'There is an understandable feeling of sadness in this room today,' he continued \u2014 before pausing in order to collect his emotions.\\n'Sadness for a lost son and a lost brother, a departed husband, a father and a colleague. Sadness for lost and damaged lives and trashed reputations and for the unmitigated undermining of the innocents by the very agents of the State established to protect them and us.'\\nThen came the hammer blows \u2014 all the harder for the precise language and measured delivery. 'It is clear that the Metropolitan Police Service has had a culture of institutional corruption for decades,' he said. 'All of us in this room and [our] loved ones, have experienced a callous indifference to their plight in dealings with the police in London. Time and time again the police leaders have sought to cover up the truth.'\\nHis ire was focused on one leader in particular. 'That the current commissioner for the metropolis is liable to personal error in a case involving just one of those in this room would be a misfortune,' he said. 'That the Dame seeks an extension of her contract after misfortune after misfortune and her own mistake after mistake, and that politicians apparently seem mindful to grant her wish of an extended contract, is a calamity. The Dame should go and go now.'\\nHis words won applause. He was a hard act to follow and almost too hard for Nick Bramall.\\n'Dad . . . was a tough soldier but he did say . . .' he began, before he too was overcome, whispering: 'Can we move on [to someone else]?' But from the sidelines his wife, Pip, intervened. 'Nick,' she said encouragingly, 'it's important to say . . .' So he took a deep breath and shared what his father had once said to him: that 'he had never been so mortally wounded, even in battle,' as he was by the Met during its inquiry into the false allegations that he was a paedophile.\\nMr Gambaccini, 72, born in the tough New York borough of the Bronx, is a consummate communicator but he too faltered as he described the lasting impact of what he had endured.\\n'No one loves a country as much as someone who has chosen to live in it,' he said. 'I came here at 21. I came to believe I was working for the best broadcasting system in the world [the BBC], which at the time it was, and I went to the best university [Oxford] in the world. And this was the most humane country in the world. And I recommended to my friends that they come and move here . . . I can no longer make that recommendation and it breaks my heart.'\\nMichael McManus was not directly impacted by police blunders, but as former prime minister Edward Heath's private secretary and biographer, he felt he could not stand by as the reputation of his long-dead boss was 'trampled on' by baseless accusations of rape and sexual assault. 'I didn't get on particularly well with him,' Mr McManus admitted. 'But I wasn't going to allow this to happen.'\\nHe could hardly credit his experience at the hands of the police. An officer sent to interview him as a witness 'didn't [even] know I had written a book about [Heath]'. When he told her she replied, 'Oh! Can I have a copy?' '\\nThe discussion moved on to the alleged 'culture of cover-up' at the Met. Baroness Lawrence asked: 'Look at where we are now. Nothing has changed. They have never learned the lessons . . . We are irrelevant. We were treated as perpetrators rather than victims.'\\nLady Brittan \u2014 a magistrate in the City of London for 20 years \u2014 agreed. 'I was certainly treated as a miscreant,' she said, recalling how her two homes had been raided by police in the wake of her husband's death. 'I could not even [bring myself to] tell my daughter I had been searched like this. It was like a violation. The detective inspector even rifled through my condolence letters.' 'That is a violation,' said Baroness Lawrence.\\n'I don't know why, but what offended me the most was that they even removed my late husband's slippers,' added Lady Brittan. 'For DNA [samples they said], but of course there was no DNA. They searched the hedges, the vegetable garden, the garage.'\\nAlastair Morgan was also nodding in fellow feeling. 'I was treated like a suspect [too]. When I went to the police station the day after [my brother's murder] to find out what was happening. The first thing the detective inspector there said to me was, 'And what was [sic] you doing last night?' There was a gruesome idiocy in their manner and the way they do things.'\\n'When my son was young I would say to him [about possible police harassment because he was black] 'Be careful when you are out,' ' said Baroness Lawrence. 'And he would say: 'But Mum, I'm not doing anything.' That didn't matter, of course.'\\nThere was a collective sigh of exasperation when the room was reminded of the Met's Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald public assertion in 2014 that Carl Beech's fantasies were 'credible and true'. 'It's astonishing,' said Alastair Morgan. 'That's for a jury to decide.'\\nBaroness Lawrence suggested that after the Rotherham child sex gang allegations were ignored by police, the Met had been 'trying to cover their backs' by believing anything which was subsequently alleged. 'But the pendulum swung so far the other way,' added Mr Proctor. What then of Cressida Dick? The table offered no support to the ambitions of the commissioner. 'She's had a hand in quite a few [controversial] cases,' said Doreen Lawrence. DCI Clive Driscoll had been 'the first police officer I trusted', but Driscoll was removed from the case he led after he had secured the convictions of two of the gang who murdered Stephen. 'She was one of those who wanted Clive to leave,' she explained.\\n'The De Menezes case [Dick was gold commander of the operation in which the innocent Jean Charles de Menezes was shot dead as a suspected suicide bomber by Met marksmen at Stockwell Tube in 2005] should have been a promotion-preventing debacle,' said Mr Gambaccini.\\n'People in authority are very na\u00efve about the police,' said Mr Morgan. 'Her rule has been catastrophic in a number of cases.'\\nSo should Commissioner Dick get an extension? 'I do not think she should,' said Baroness Lawrence. 'The fact we are sitting around this table here and we have had to struggle and fight for everything. The Met has a lot to answer for and Cressida Dick's name comes up in so many [controversial] cases.'\\nLady Brittan agreed with her. 'The commissioner is part of the problem and not the solution,' she said. 'All we see is the culture of cover-up and promotion. They put their personal objectives before the pursuit of justice and protection of the public.'\\nNo to her contract extension, said Mr Morgan. No, said everyone. Had anyone around the table any more confidence in the IOPC? A collective shake of the head. 'Set up wrongly, led wrongly, or both,' said Lady Brittan.\\n'We are here because the police put us here,' said Mr Gambaccini. 'And they have this strange idea that we're going to give up and go away just because they want us to. They are going to be held to account. I don't think the Prime Minister and Home Secretary realise what they dealing with.' Indeed, they will have to deal with a devastating letter of accord from the seven. Commissioner Dick cannot be allowed to continue. The IOPC has to be torn down and rebuilt. Gross failure and injustice had driven the disparate together. Affinity reigned.\\n'That was strangely cathartic,' said Lady Brittan afterwards. 'I felt very touched and comforted by talking to Alastair Morgan.'\\nHaving been hesitant about taking part, Mr Morgan confessed: 'I feel a kinship with everyone in this room.' Institutionalised injustice can do that. Whatever part of the community or political spectrum you inhabit.\\nSTEPHEN GLOVER: Commissioner Cling-On is not a bad person but she has lost any claim to competence\\nComment by Stephen Glover for the Daily Mail\\nWhen decent, law-abiding folk accuse the Metropolitan Police of systemic corruption, harassment of the innocent, and racial discrimination, it\u2019s time for the Government to sit up and take notice.\\nSeven people who have experienced or witnessed the Met\u2019s ineptitude and dishonesty have written a letter to the Prime Minister in which they call for greater accountability and better oversight.\\nThey also demand that the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick \u2014 whom they accuse of having \u2018presided over a culture of incompetence\u2019 \u2014 shouldn\u2019t have her five-year contract extended when it expires next April.\\nInvaded\\nThese complainants, brought together by the Mail, come from different backgrounds. They represent many shades of political opinion. But they are united in their deep distrust of Britain\u2019s largest police force.\\nWhat was done to these people, or those dear to them, by the Met could happen to any of us. This is a shocking indictment. We are brought up to have faith in the police as an institution. How is that possible when we learn of such unforgivable behaviour?\\nThe Hampshire home of the late Lord Bramall, an elderly war hero, was invaded by police in the early hours on the basis of allegations of paedophile abuse made by Carl Beech, a palpable fantasist. Bramall told his son Nick that \u2018he had never been so mortally wounded, even in battle\u2019.\\nDoreen Lawrence had to endure many years of indifference (which she partly attributes to racism) on the part of the Metropolitan Police after the murder of her son, Stephen, in 1993.\\nNick Bramall and Baroness Lawrence were among the victims assembled by this newspaper. Their stories are very different but they share a common theme. The Met can be overbearing, devious and callous.\\nOh, when the excesses and errors are finally uncovered the force is very good at saying sorry. Lady Brittan, whose entirely innocent husband, Leon, was harried by the police as he was dying, received profuse apologies after his death. What good were they to her or him?\\nActions count louder than words, and again and again the story is the same. No officer involved in Operation Midland \u2014 the botched investigation that resulted in false accusations against Lord Bramall, Lord Brittan, and another complainant, Harvey Proctor \u2014 received any official sanction.\\nDame Cressida Dick herself is living proof that if you work for the Met, it\u2019s possible to foul up and survive. Home Secretary Priti Patel and London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who share responsibility for appointing the next Commissioner, appear poised to give Dame Cressida another two years.\\nHow can this be justified? In June, an official report described her force as \u2018institutionally corrupt\u2019, and concluded that she had personally placed \u2018hurdles\u2019 in the way of a search for the truth about the death of Daniel Morgan.\\nMr Morgan, a private investigator, was brutally killed in a London car park in 1987. The Met has never found his murderer, and appears to have gone out of its way not to. His brother, Alastair, is another of the signatories of the letter to the PM.\\nBaroness O\u2019Loan, who led the recent investigation, accused Dame Cressida Dick of \u2018obfuscation\u2019. You\u2019d think that would constitute a knock-out blow, and precipitate her resignation, since Metropolitan Police Commissioners are not supposed put up smokescreens during official inquiries.\\nBut she survived, as she always does, and as senior Met police officers who err usually do. She emerged unscathed earlier this year after her force provoked outrage by outlawing a peaceful vigil on Clapham Common to honour Sarah Everard, who\u2019d been abducted and murdered by a serving police officer, PC Wayne Couzens.\\nThe recruitment of Couzens, whose former colleagues at the Civil Nuclear Constabulary nearly ten years ago allegedly nicknamed him \u2018the rapist\u2019, might in itself have been thought grounds for Dame Cressida to consider her position. I don\u2019t suppose it crossed her mind to fall on her sword.\\nBut then she has always had the amazing knack of evading responsibility. In 2005, she was in overall charge of the operation which resulted in the appalling death of the wholly innocent Brazilian, Jean Charles de Menezes, in a London Underground station. Police pumped seven bullets into his head.\\nAs usual, no officer, including Cressida Dick, faced any charges, and no one was reprimanded. All that happened was that the Met was found guilty of breaching health and safety laws, and putting the public at risk. It was fined \u00a3175,000 and ordered to pay \u00a3385,000 costs. That\u2019s taxpayers\u2019 money.\\nMistakes\\nIt is true, of course, that some of the allegations made by the seven signatories don\u2019t concern the Commissioner personally. For example, although she sanctioned Operation Midland, she can\u2019t be held culpable for all its failings.\\nOn the other hand, in 2019 she refused to allow an inquiry into the conduct of officers involved in Operation Midland after ex-High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques revealed they had used false evidence to obtain a search warrant for the raids. Dame Cressida ludicrously said that an inquiry would be \u2018completely improper\u2019.\\nHere is someone for whom drawing a veil over her own mistakes, and those of subordinates allegedly at fault, has become second nature. As the signatories rightly say, the Met is not adequately accountable.\\nWhen there is a supposedly impartial investigation of its misbehaviour, this is carried out by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which often finds in the Met\u2019s favour.\\nUnsurprisingly, it was its equally accommodating predecessor, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), that gave the Met and Dame Cressida a clean bill of health over the killing of Jean Charles de Menezes.\\nRisible\\nI don\u2019t suggest that she is in any way a bad person. No doubt she is intelligent and diligent. But she has become institutionalised, and as part of that process has lost whatever capacity she once had for examining herself and her force.\\nWhat is needed is someone with a new perspective from outside London who can get to grips with the Met\u2019s shortcomings. It\u2019s risible to suggest that such a person doesn\u2019t exist in the upper echelons of the police, and therefore Dame Cressida might as well be reappointed for a further couple of years.\\nWhen Boris Johnson became London Mayor in 2008, one of his first actions was to ease out Ian Blair, then Metropolitan Commissioner, who has always been a supporter of Dame Cressida.\\nIf only Priti Patel and Sadiq Khan had the courage to bid her farewell, rather than clinging on to her in a half-hearted way out of a misguided belief that they can\u2019t find anyone better.\\nHere are seven victims from all walks of life with first-hand knowledge of the Met\u2019s deficiencies. Their criticisms are devastating. I believe they speak on behalf of most law-abiding people.\\nNeedless to say, an efficient police force is essential in the capital and elsewhere, and I\u2019m certain society couldn\u2019t begin to function without the dedication of ordinary police officers.\\nBut Britain\u2019s most senior police officer should stand down now. If the politicians daren\u2019t get rid of her, our only hope is that she has enough sense of honour to accept that the time has come for her to go.", "image": [["A landmark panel of victims of police corruption, incompetence and malpractice today call for the head of Cressida Dick", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/08/21/47674391-9971255-image-a-5_1631134242845.jpg"], ["Alastair Morgan, Baroness Lawrence, Paul Gambaccini, Michael McManus, Nick Bramall, Harvey Proctor, and Lady Brittan", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/08/21/47674387-9971255-image-a-2_1631134221322.jpg"], ["The bombshell letter to Boris.\u00a0The group tell the Prime Minister: 'Dame Cressida Dick, who has presided over a culture of incompetence and cover-up, must not have her contract extended and must be properly investigated for her conduct, along with her predecessors and those in her inner circle, who she appointed and who have questions to answer'", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/08/21/47674327-9971255-image-a-7_1631134260297.jpg"], ["Lady Brittan's husband Leon was falsely accused of rape and murder by serial fantasists.

The first choice would reportedly be to move them to Royal Navy base at Devonport in Plymouth.", "text": "Contingency plans are in place to move Britain's nuclear weapons to France\u00a0if Scotland gains independence, it was reported last night.\\nThe UK's four nuclear submarines, armed with Trident missiles since 1996, have been based at HMNB Clyde at Faslane in western Scotland since 1968.\\nA secondary base at Coulport, less than ten miles away, is where missiles are routinely stored.\\nAround 6,500 people are employed at Faslane, with a further 200 at Coulport. But ministers are said to have drawn up plans to move the vessels to naval bases in the US or France in the event of the break-up of the Union.\\nThe Ministry of Defence might also try to lease the existing naval bases, creating a British Overseas Territory within Scotland which has been dubbed 'Nuclear Gibraltar' by some insiders.\\nThe first and preferred option would reportedly be to relocate the submarines to the Royal Navy base at Devonport in Plymouth.\\nSenior officials told the Financial Times they had been briefed on the contingency plans, which they said showed the difficult choices potentially ahead.\\nNicola Sturgeon's SNP Scottish government was re-elected in May with a promise of a second referendum. The SNP has long opposed the UK's nuclear deterrent.\\nAccording to analysis written by the Royal United Services Institute, which was written ahead of the first Scottish independence referendum in 2014, the costs of a move to Devonport - which is the largest naval base in Western Europe, could cost between \u00a33billion and \u00a34billion.\\nIf Britain's nuclear weapons were to move to the US, a likely location would reportedly be Kings Bay, in Georgia. It is the current base for the US Navy Atlantic fleet of Trident submarines.\\nThis option is said to be preferred by the Treasury because it would be the least expensive.\\nHowever, basing Trident outside Britain may make it more difficult to defend the country's sovereignty in the event of a military threat.\\nIf the submarine base were to be moved to France, it was reported that the vessels would go to the home of the French nuclear fleet, at\u00a0\u00cele Longue in Brittany in the north of the country.\\nWhile HMNB Clyde at Faslane is the home base of the submarines themselves, the Royal Naval Armaments Depot at Coulport is responsible for storing, processing and maintaining missiles when they are not loaded on submarines.\\nThe Royal Navy's association with Faslane - which lies on the eastern shore of Gare Loch - stretches back as far as the First World War.\\nIt was in the loch that the steam-propelled HMS K13 sank in 1917 after her engine room flooded during sea trials.\\nIn the Second World War, large jetties and a railway were built at Faslane to accommodate arrivals of troops and supplies on large ships from across the Atlantic.\\nAfter the conflict ended in 1945, the base was used to break up old navy vessels. The last battleship to be scrapped in Britain, HMS Vanguard, was taken apart at Faslane in 1962.\\nThe base was also used as a home for submarines.\\nBut its long and controversial link with nuclear weapons began in 1968, after navy chiefs and politicians had made the decision that the UK should have its own lethal deterrent amid the threats posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War.\\nOn May 10, 1968, after the Polaris Sales Agreement with the US - which allowed Royal Navy submarines to carry lethal UGM-27 nuclear missiles - the new nuclear base at Faslane came into being.\\nThen known as HMS Neptune, it was opened by the Queen Mother. Later that year, the first patrol was carried out by the HMS Resolution, which was launched in 1963 and was the first of the four Resolution-class submarines.\\nThe following year, the UK had committed to the policy which remains in place today - Continuous At Sea Deterrence (CASD).\\nWhilst details were top secret when the operation first began, it is now public knowledge that any one of four nuclear submarines are guaranteed to be deployed at any given time.\\nThe second submarine used for the Polaris programme was HMS Renown, which was launched in 1964.

As night falls and the lights turn the sky neon bright as far as the eye can see, the chimneys keep remorselessly pumping out their toxic fumes.\\nThis is the Ningdong Energy and Chemical Industry Base, one of the biggest industrial complexes in the world.\\nSprawling in semi-desert far to the west of Beijing, it covers an area so vast \u2014 341 square miles, more than two thirds the size of Los Angeles \u2014 it is almost unimaginable.\\nMuch of The Base, as it is known locally, is home to mines, which produce 130 million metric tonnes of coal a year \u2014 about the same as the annual total dug from all 233 deep mines still in use in Britain when coal was our biggest energy source in the 1970s.\\nThe coal \u2014 the most polluting of all fossil fuels \u2014 is fed into an array of huge power stations at the complex, which have the capacity to generate 17.3 gigawatts. That would be enough to satisfy a third of the UK\u2019s peak demand for electricity.\\nAlso to be found at The Base are 32 companies that use coal to make chemicals, so generating still more carbon pollution.\\nAnd on top of all this is the showpiece: the world\u2019s largest coal-to-liquid (CTL) plant, run by the state-owned Shenhua Ningxia Coal Industry Group.\\nSimply burning coal is dirty enough, producing more carbon dioxide than any other method of generating electricity \u2014 almost twice as much as burning natural gas. But making oil from coal is far worse: it can double the amount of CO2 pumped into the atmosphere from every unit of energy.\\nYet China\u2019s Shenhua group \u2014 now restructured as part of China Energy \u2014 has been investing heavily in this hugely polluting CTL plant.\\nNo Western journalist has ever been allowed to visit the site. But in 2017 a Chinese researcher, Xing Zhang, was given a tour by the firm\u2019s vice chairman, Dr Yao Min.\\nHer findings, written up in a blog for the International Energy Agency (IEA), revealed that Shenhua had by then invested 55 billion yuan \u2014 or \u00a36.2 billion \u2014 in the CTL plant alone. Each year, the plant turns 20 million tonnes of coal into four million tonnes of oil products; 2.7 million tonnes of diesel; a million tonnes of naptha petroleum; and 340,000 tonnes of liquid gas.\\nAnd The Base is not China\u2019s only large CTL plant. There are at least six others in the country that are already built or under construction \u2014 and China says it plans to build still more in nations where it has lavished investment, such as Pakistan.\\nYet The Base accounts for just a fraction of China\u2019s coal dependency. Its coal power station fleet grew five-fold between 2000 and 2020, and now accounts for almost half the world\u2019s consumption \u2014 more than three times its closest rival, the U.S. It is said to have 1,080 separate plants with a total capacity last year of 1,005 gigawatts \u2014 and is building more.\\nBritain, in contrast, has just four coal-fuelled plants left, with a joint output of 5.4 gigawatts. This week, in his apocalyptic climate change speech to the United Nations, Boris Johnson urged China \u2014 by far the world\u2019s worst emitter of greenhouse gases, producing as much as 28 per cent of the global total \u2014 to end its domestic use of coal.\\nMr Johnson is only too aware that if Cop26, the UN climate conference to be held in Glasgow in November, is not to be regarded as a dismal failure, China must be persuaded to make meaningful cuts in CO2 emissions.\\nBut far from carbon emissions slowing down in China, they are increasing ever more rapidly.\\nThis is a country with a mind-boggling pace of development. Between 2011 and 2013, China used more cement than the U.S. did in the entire 20th century. It produces almost 60 per cent of the world\u2019s steel and its oil refinery capacity has tripled since 2000.\\nEven though it promised last week to stop building coal power stations abroad, China continues to do just that at home. Last year, its coal-powered capacity rose by 38 gigawatts, while the rest of the world cut capacity by 17 gigawatts.\\nChina has a further 105 gigawatts of new coal capacity in the construction pipeline \u2014 more than the entire generating capacity of the UK from all sources, including nuclear and renewables.\\nLast month, the Workers\u2019 Daily reported that in coal-rich Inner Mongolia, 38 mothballed coal mines have been reopened, with an annual production of 60 million tonnes. Last year, Inner Mongolia dug up more than a billion tonnes of coal \u2014 and this did not even make it China\u2019s biggest coal province: that honour belonged to Shanxi.\\nChina\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, claimed last year that although Chinese emissions would keep rising until 2030, they would then reach their peak and decline, eventually reaching Net Zero by 2060 \u2014 ten years after Britain.\\nBut he has given few details on how this might be achieved, and there are ominous signs that he has no intention of keeping his word. When President Biden\u2019s climate change envoy, John Kerry, went to Beijing this month to put pressure on the regime on carbon emissions, he was humiliated.\\nKerry was forced to hold his meetings via Zoom \u2014 he might as well have stayed in Washington \u2014 and China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, politicised the encounter, warning him that if America wanted China to talk seriously about emissions, it must first stop treating it as \u2018a threat and a rival\u2019.\\n\u2018Climate change cannot be separated from the larger People\u2019s Republic of China\u2013U.S. relations environment,\u2019 Mr Wang added. By this, he meant China would not contemplate making new pledges on emissions if the U.S. continued to raise awkward issues such as the crushing of democracy in Hong Kong, the militarisation of the South China Sea and the enslavement of Muslim Uighurs.\\nAlok Sharma, the UK minister in charge of Cop26, has admitted he doesn\u2019t know whether President Xi will even show up at the event. An editorial in Chinese Communist newspaper the Global Times told Mr Sharma that if he wants the conference to succeed, he must not let it be \u2018held hostage by U.S. political ideologues\u2019.\\nBut while China obfuscates, we in Britain are cutting carbon emissions to the bone, inflicting deep harm on our economy.\\nThe dizzying rise in household bills, and the bankruptcy of so many gas companies, is part of the price we are paying for giving up coal in our rush towards green energy.\\nAs this newspaper reported last month, while we do our bit to slow climate change, it is estimated the cost of our transition to Net Zero will run into trillions of pounds.\\nYet even though Britain accounts for less than 1 per cent of global emissions \u2014 one 28th as much as China \u2014 we still treat the regime with kid gloves, arguing that China deserves leeway because it is still a \u2018developing\u2019 country.\\nEven the eco-protesters blocking our motorways pay no attention to the fact China is pumping out pollution on an unprecedented scale.\\nLast week, when a BBC reporter asked the group that spawned them, Extinction Rebellion, why they were not demonstrating outside the Chinese embassy, he was accused of \u2018perpetuating anti-Chinese racist stereotypes\u2019.\\nFormer Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, co-chair of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, which has members in 20 countries, told me this week that \u2018governments across the free world have been utterly supine\u2019.\\nHe added: \u2018China may say their emissions will peak by 2030 but meanwhile they are building all the new coal-fired power stations they need, to do whatever they please.\\n\u2018Yet they are being let off the hook while other countries are being asked to step up to measures that will have an incalculable economic impact. China will watch while we collapse our economies and they become all-powerful.\u2019\\nGary Smith, general secretary of the GMB union, thousands of whose members have lost their jobs to Chinese competitors, puts it more succinctly: \u2018We are importing virtue and exporting jobs.\u2019\\nLet us look at how emissions compare with Western countries. China\u2019s total emissions have far outstripped America\u2019s. Indeed, they amount to more than the rest of the developed world put together \u2014 although admittedly they are still lower by one measure: America still emits more per head of population.\\nHowever, that ceased to be true of Britain in 2014 \u2014 and by 2018 China was well ahead, with 6.84 tonnes of CO2 emitted per capita, against 5.3 tonnes in Britain.\\nTo appreciate how fast China\u2019s economy and emissions have grown, consider that in 1990 we emitted 9.6 tonnes per head and China just 1.84 tonnes.\\nSince 2018, our emissions have continued to fall while China\u2019s have increased. In total, the International Energy Agency (IEA) says, they have risen in China by 365 per cent since 1990. In the same period, Britain\u2019s fell by 35 per cent.\\nTwo further indicators reveal how great the impact of cheap energy has been on China\u2019s economy \u2014 and give the lie to the claim they are still a \u2018developing country\u2019 which deserves to be indulged.\\nFirst, carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere a long time, taking up to 200 years to be absorbed by the oceans. This means the emissions a country generates accumulate over time. The quantity of accumulated emissions reveals the degree to which China already dominates world manufacturing.\\nFrom 1990 to 2019, China\u2019s accumulated emissions amounted to 167 billion tonnes of CO2. Britain\u2019s were just 14 billion tonnes.\\nThe second point is that the IEA, which produces this data, relies on figures supplied by the Chinese government \u2014 and many claim they are unreliable.\\nIn 2019, Hong Kong\u2019s South China Morning Post \u2014 then still a newspaper that could publish material critical of the Communist regime \u2014 reported that the Chinese environment ministry was \u2018frequently presented with fake data and fabricated documents\u2019, citing dozens of cases of fraud.\\n\u2018The party committee of Bozhou district in Zunyi, southern China, was found to have fabricated notes for ten meetings \u2014 part of the work requirement under the new environmental targets \u2014 in a bid to cheat the inspectors,\u2019 the paper said.\\nWhich explains why some sources, including Carbon Brief (a green news service) and the Rhodium Group (a New York think-tank), say China\u2019s emissions are far higher than those cited by the IEA.\\nIt is true that China is building wind and solar renewables. But their share of China\u2019s energy mix remains negligible (see graph on previous page), while its coal, gas and oil use expand inexorably.\\nThere are those who say that, despite all this, we should trust China \u2014 and Xi\u2019s promise that its emissions will start to fall and eventually reach Net Zero.\\nFormer U.S. vice president and green campaigner Al Gore is an enthusiastic advocate: \u2018I think they will overachieve that goal,\u2019 he gushed earlier this year. \u2018They put out goals only when they are absolutely certain they can reach them, and they often overachieve.\u2019\\nOthers are more doubtful, none more so than Lord Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong. Speaking to the Mail this week, he recalled how he used to voice scepticism about China in the Nineties, only to be told by diplomat Sir Percy Cradock, a prominent apologist for the country: \u2018They may be thuggish dictators but they are men of their word.\u2019\\nOn the contrary, he said this week, \u2018they are thuggish dictators but they are NOT men of their word\u2019.\\nChina, he added, has flagrantly breached the Hong Kong handover treaty, which guaranteed basic freedoms for at least 50 years. It has broken its pledges over trade.\\nAnd most recently, in the Covid pandemic, it broke the promises it made after the 2002 SARS outbreak to be transparent and notify the World Health Organisation within 24 hours if it discovered a new deadly disease.\\n\u2018The idea that you can believe what they say about environmental targets is for the birds,\u2019 Lord Patten said. \u2018Again and again, they rat on what they promise. Yet we are told we must be nice to them or they won\u2019t keep their word.\\n\u2018I\u2019m sure there are groups in China that want to see a reduction in emissions. That is not the concern of the Communist leadership, which wants to keep on growing, dominate global markets and ensure that Chinese standards of living increase.\u2019\\nFormer Chancellor Lord Lawson, founder of the Global Warming Policy Forum, warned that Boris Johnson cannot afford to be naive. \u2018If China doesn\u2019t sign up to immediate cuts in its emissions, instead of continuing to expand the use of the coal on which its industrial stranglehold depends, Cop26 is going to be a stage in an unfolding catastrophe.\\n\u2018The soaring price of energy in Britain is already wreaking havoc and it is set to get much worse, leading to bankruptcies, inflation and unemployment. Yet China is getting away with voicing green intentions while its actions demonstrate the reverse.\\n\u2018Britain\u2019s acts of self-harm will not help save the planet but merely outsource more jobs to a country wallowing in cheap, coal-fired power. If we want China to realise Xi Jinping\u2019s stated goal of becoming the world\u2019s only superpower by 2049, this is a great way to do it.\u2019\\nSir Iain Duncan Smith agreed: \u2018We are heading for a great historical disaster. The free world is emasculating itself while China gets stronger and more dominant. They will soon be impossible to resist.\u2019", "image": [["Pupils cover their noses after school in heavy smog on December 23, 2015 in Binzhou, China", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/24/20/48354863-10026335-image-a-8_1632513425434.jpg"], ["Since 2018, our emissions have continued to fall while China\u00bfs have increased", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/24/20/48354835-10026335-image-a-9_1632513456627.jpg"], ["From 1990 to 2019, China\u00bfs accumulated emissions amounted to 167 billion tonnes of CO2.

The priorities are all wrong.'\\nHowever, when asked by Mr Robinson about how an independent Scotland would be a member of Nato whilst maintaining its opposition, she only repeated her party's position and said it would be 'incredible' to think it would change.\\n'We don't support nuclear weapons, there is no place for nuclear weapons in Scotland. We have a longstanding and unequivocal opposition to nuclear weapons, both in principle but also in terms of their location in Scotland.\\n'I'm sure your listeners may understand why this is something that is of real significant importance to people in Scotland, given that this nuclear arsenal is just a few miles down the river from our biggest and most popular city.\\n'What I'm saying is that our policy has not changed. We do have a policy position where we support being a part of Nato but I think that it would be slightly incredible to think that we would be changing our position in terms of our opposition to nuclear weapons.'\\nThe politician added that a newly-independent Scottish government would look to get the issue of the nuclear bases' removal 'agreed' with the British Government and 'moved on as quickly as possible'.\\nAccording to the FT, the MoD's first and preferred option would be to relocate the submarines to the Royal Navy base at Devonport in Plymouth.\\nSenior officials said had been briefed on the contingency plans, which they said showed the difficult choices potentially ahead.\\nAccording to analysis written by the Royal United Services Institute, which was written ahead of the first Scottish independence referendum in 2014, the costs of a move to Devonport - which is the largest naval base in Western Europe, could cost between \u00a33billion and \u00a34billion.\\nIf Britain's nuclear weapons were to move to the US, a likely location would reportedly be Kings Bay, in Georgia. It is the current base for the US Navy Atlantic fleet of Trident submarines.\\nThis option is said to be preferred by the Treasury because it would be the least expensive.\\nHowever, basing Trident outside Britain may make it more difficult to defend the country's sovereignty in the event of a military threat.\\nIf the submarine base were to be moved to France, it was reported that the vessels would go to the home of the French nuclear fleet, at\u00a0\u00cele Longue in Brittany in the north of the country.\\nWhile HMNB Clyde at Faslane is the home base of the submarines themselves, the Royal Naval Armaments Depot at Coulport is responsible for storing, processing and maintaining missiles when they are not loaded on submarines.\\nThe Royal Navy's association with Faslane - which lies on the eastern shore of Gare Loch - stretches back as far as the First World War.\\nIt was in the loch that the steam-propelled HMS K13 sank in 1917 after her engine room flooded during sea trials.\\nIn the Second World War, large jetties and a railway were built at Faslane to accommodate arrivals of troops and supplies on large ships from across the Atlantic.\\nAfter the conflict ended in 1945, the base was used to break up old navy vessels. The last battleship to be scrapped in Britain, HMS Vanguard, was taken apart at Faslane in 1962.\\nThe base was also used as a home for submarines.\\nBut its long and controversial link with nuclear weapons began in 1968, after navy chiefs and politicians had made the decision that the UK should have its own lethal deterrent amid the threats posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War.\\nOn May 10, 1968, after the Polaris Sales Agreement with the US - which allowed Royal Navy submarines to carry lethal UGM-27 nuclear missiles - the new nuclear base at Faslane came into being.\\nThen known as HMS Neptune, it was opened by the Queen Mother. Later that year, the first patrol was carried out by the HMS Resolution, which was launched in 1963 and was the first of the four Resolution-class submarines.\\nThe following year, the UK had committed to the policy which remains in place today - Continuous At Sea Deterrence (CASD).\\nWhilst details were top secret when the operation first began, it is now public knowledge that any one of four nuclear submarines are guaranteed to be deployed at any given time.\\nThe second submarine used for the Polaris programme was HMS Renown, which was launched in 1964. It was followed by HMS Revenge in May 1965 and HMS Repulse in June of that year.\\nThe Resolution-Class submarines and their Polaris missiles began to be phased out in 1992, when the first of the four Vanguard submarines were built. They were set to carry the new Trident system, which is still in place today.\\nThe four submarines carrying Trident missiles are HMS Vanguard, HMS Victorious, HMS Vigilant and HMS Vengeance.\\nEach missile carried on the submarines has warheads which are more powerful than the bombs dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in World War Two.\\nThe reasoning behind basing the UK's nuclear weapons at Faslane was centred around the fact it is deep, easy to navigate and offers easy access to the North Atlantic.\\nHowever, the decision to place nuclear weapons on UK territory met fierce opposition from anti-nuclear campaigners. Hundreds of protests have taken place in the decades since the weapons arrived.\\nA permanent protest site alongside the base, known as Faslane Peace Camp, has been occupied continuously since the early 1980s.\\nIn April this year, Extinction Rebellion activists chained themselves to giant plant pots during a protest outside the site.\\nIn 2016, MPs backed the renewal of the Trident system. It is expected to cost more than \u00a330billion and delivery of the new fleet is not expected until the early 2030s.\\nIt will mean that when the Vanguard submarines leave service, they will have operated for at least ten years beyond their expected operational life.\\nCritics have also previously argued that the cost of building, arming running and repairing four new nuclear submarines over their 40 years of operational life could be more than \u00a3100million\\nThe MoD said on Wednesday: 'The UK is strongly committed to maintaining its credible and independent nuclear deterrent at HM Naval Base Clyde, which exists to deter the most extreme threats to the UK and our Nato allies.\\n'There are no plans to move the nuclear deterrent from HM Naval Base Clyde (Faslane), which contributes to Scotland's and the wider UK's security and economy, and its supporting facilities are safe for local communities.'\\nA Scottish Government spokeswoman previously said: 'The Scottish Government firmly oppose the possession, threat and use of nuclear weapons and we are committed to the safe and complete withdrawal of Trident from Scotland.'", "image": [["The SNP have warned the British Government that they will reject any attempt to keep Britain's nuclear submarines north of the border in the event of an independence vote.

He is said to have been inspired to take up climate activism after his farm in Wales went bust due to bad weather.\\nIronically, Mr Hallam owns a farmhouse which was described as 'poorly insulated' in an official energy performance certificate. His 2,000 sq ft farmhouse in Carmarthen, South Wales, was given the lowest possible energy rating on the certificate. It is unclear if Mr Hallam has taken steps to improve the rating since it was issued six years ago.\\nAsked about the certificate last night, a spokesman for the group said: 'This is the point \u2013 UK homes are the leakiest in Europe, with many millions of families being unable to afford the advice and help needed to insulate the building they live in.'\\nJoining Mr Hallam was David McKenny, 38, from Cambridge, who was one of six XR protesters who 'doorstepped' TV wildlife expert Sir David Attenborough, 95, at the height of pandemic after he criticised their tactics. The group posted a letter through Sir David's door as he isolated due to his age last year.\\nVegan business coach Zoe Cohen, 51, from Lymm, Cheshire, said she joined yesterday's action to demand 'real action' from ministers. She was involved in XR's takeover of central London last month.\\nMs Cohen said then: 'We are more scared of the reality of what this system is doing to ending life on Earth and ending our future and our children's future than we are of spending a night in a cell.' She describes herself as a 'carbon literate coach' and 'XR catalyser' on social media.\\nJanine Eagling, 60, from London, helped to block the M25 and A13 junction yesterday. She has been involved with XR since 2018, helping to form blockades across Waltham Forest.\\nThe IT project manager describes herself online as a 'world citizen' and 'rebel' as well as a cyclist, walker and gardener. She has overseen IT projects at top universities and was part of a campaign to improve safety for cyclists in the capital.\\nLiam Norton, 36, a London electrician who helped organise the protest, said he was 'shocked at the lack of significant action from our Government'.\\nHe became involved in climate activism in 2018 when he helped blockade five bridges in the capital and went on to join XR's 'actions team', which is responsible for planning civil disobedience. He was convicted over blocking printing presses last year.\\nHe delayed court proceedings by gluing himself to a table. It took three hours for police to remove him and the stunt is thought to have cost the taxpayer thousands of pounds.\\nHe told Good Morning Britain: 'The government is not looking after their citizens. We are.\\n'We've got a plan to insulate Britain that gives you the best value for money in terms of reducing emissions. Hundreds of thousands of meaningful jobs will be created.'\\nAnother protester, Steve Gower, 54, from Gloucester, is unemployed but describes himself as a volunteer advocate for the homeless and is an active Unite union campaigner.\\nLast summer Gower was\u00a0ordered to pay \u00a3267 by a magistrate after he\u00a0dropped a cigarette in the street while visiting a Jobcentre. He said that the fine spiralled because he couldn't afford the reduced fine of \u00a375 and was told there was no opportunity to pay in instalments.\\nHe was joined at the M25 road blockage by Eli Rose, 26, who spent 16 days in a tree last September to protest the HS2 rail link.\\nMs Rose lived in the tree in Parliament Square because she 'cannot bear' knowing her potential future children will be born 'into a world where they will have to battle through food shortages and drought.'\\nIt comes as officers took more than two-and-a-half hours to clear off climate protesters who were obstructing Britain's busiest motorway yesterday in videos that sparked fury online.\\nIn one clip, a female officer politely tells activists: 'If any of you have any questions, or are in any discomfort or need anything, just let us know' - while stricken motorists couldn't get to work, hospitals and appointments.\\nAnother video showed an officer standing with his hands in his pockets on his own and being met with silence after asking the demonstrators which of them had organised Wednesday's protest.\\nHe then told them, 'I'm going to have to ask you to move' before awkwardly leaving.\\nMeanwhile, police had to restrain incensed truck drivers who desperately tried to move eco-warriors who had glued their hands to the road.\\nChief Superintendent Richard Liversidge, of Herts Police, said: 'Police received calls alerting us to a protest near junction 1 (South Mimms) of the A1M shortly after 8am on Wednesday. Patrolling officers were at the scene by 8.08am and were faced with a challenging situation in which protestors had blocked the carriageway and glued themselves to the tarmac.\\n'Tasked with ensuring the safety of the wider public and those in the carriageway, they worked quickly to minimise disruption to motorists on the local and wider road network. Unavoidably, due to this group's actions, it took time to safely de-bond the protestors from the tarmac as well as ensure that the roads could be safely re-opened.\\nObstruction of a British road 'without lawful authority or excuse' is an offence under Section 137 of the Highways Act 1980.\\nPolice arrested a large number of the Insulate Britain activists under this law, but no one has been charged.\\nThere were also arrests for the common law offence of public nuisance, and conspiracy to cause danger to road users under section 22A of the Road Traffic Act 1988.\\nIf police had been given the Crown Prosecution Service's go ahead, they could have charged the activists with the obstruction offence and sent them to a magistrates' court where they could be punished with a fine and up to six months in prison.\\nThere would also be the option to arrest or charge them under an alternative law, such as obstructing emergency workers under the Emergency Workers (Obstruction) Act 2006 - the maximum penalty for which is a \u00a35,000 fine.\\nOfficers were also criticised for taking up to four hours to arrest the protesters even though they were clearly breaking the law under the obstruction of a road offence.\\n'Policing protests is complex, in part due to the operating environment, the number of people involved and the need for us to deploy specialist resources to resolve and manage the situation.\\n'There are clear, national standards regarding the policing of a protest which our officers were following. The powers we have are created by Parliament, and we use them fairly and proportionately.\\n'Comment has been made about the approach taken by my officers, and I would like to remind people that what they are seeing is a very short clip, depicting an officer engaging with the group and informing them that if they did not move off the road, they were going to be arrested, in line with standard procedure.\\n'This resulted in 18 arrests being made yesterday and a full investigation is underway.\\n'We understand the frustration regarding the traffic delays experienced but would ask that people understand that we did \u2013 and are doing \u2013 everything in our power to deal with the situation.'\\nDemonstrators from the\u00a0Extinction Rebellion offshoot protest group halted traffic near Junction 23 at South Mimms from 8am while another group shut down the main carriageway of the M25 anti-clockwise in Surrey between Junction 10 and Junction 8.\\nA 50-year-old woman was airlifted to hospital with serious injuries following a crash\u00a0at Junction 9 involving multiple vehicles.\\nIn a statement, Surrey Police said the investigation is ongoing and that 'it is too early to know' if the crash was caused by the protest. Traffic monitor Inrix said at around 2pm that there was a six-mile traffic queue on the M25 following the accident.\\nA third group glued their hands to the road on Junction 1b near the Dartford Crossing.\\nDemos also took place at Junction 25 on the M25, the A10 in Hertfordshire and Junction 10 of the A3 in Surrey. By around 9.30am, the group had blocked traffic in five locations.\\nThe junctions targeted by climate demonstrators this week were:\\nThe junctions targeted by the eco-mob on Monday were:\\n\\nMr Mackinlay told MailOnline:\u00a0'The M25 is one of the busiest roads in the country and a key artery powering the economy of London and the South East. It is little wonder that this new group, 'Insulate Britain' have chosen it for their pathetic protest.\\n'Putting aside the fact that the Government has and in allocating more grant funding for the measures they are campaigning for than ever before is obviously lost on them. As a splinter group of other organisations with Marxist overtones the true nature of their protest is obvious.\\n'The police must use the powers available to them to clear this protest immediately and the courts should use their powers to grant compensation to the public and businesses affected, taking protestors to bankruptcy as necessary.'\\nMP Andrew Bridgen slammed the 'extremely irresponsible' demonstrators, saying: 'They are putting people's livelihoods and indeed lives at risk through their reckless behaviour. They don't actually care about what's good for the general public and they are little more than anarchists.'\\nJames Gray added: 'It's a scandal and bad manners. I have long struggled for people's rights to protest peacefully, but they must not deny the freedoms of other people. If activists stop people on the M25 from getting into work or prevent journalists from going to their offices, then they are disrupting the nation. That is wrong, and they should not be allowed to get away with that.'\\nProtesters held signs which said 'sorry for the disruption' as they clashed with drivers stuck in the queue. One motorist told LBC: 'They are working against themselves', while others screamed abuse telling the activists 'we'll lose our jobs'. One could be heard calling them 'f**king scumbags'.\\nInsulate Britain, which is demanding government action on home insulation, tweeted: '#InsulateBritain are back. @BorisJohnson can you hear us yet?'\\nIt took police two-and-a-half hours to clear the climate protesters from the four locations yesterday as an eco-mob caused chaos by\u00a0holding up rush hour traffic on the M25, A3 and Dartford Crossing.\\nOne woman revealed how she was on the way to see her daughter, who had just gone into labour, when she was caught up in the protest.\\nLBC reporter Rachael Venables said the woman was stuck while on the way to pick up her grandchild and take her to the hospital.\\nAnother woman took to Twitter to express her frustration, writing: 'Thank you #InsulateBritain . Now I can't get to work to teach the young people you say you're protecting.'\\nAlso among those held up shortly after 8am was an NHS worker trying to get home after a night shift.\\nJay told LBC: 'I'm exhausted. I'm not happy with the situation.'\\nPharmacist Graham Weidle said: 'I need to open a pharmacy in Soho. We all support climate change, we all support sustainability and we all support a more regenerative way of life. But this doesn't help.'\\nOne motorist on Twitter said his nurse wife was trying to get her elderly mother to an urgent hospital appointment but was being held up by 'these muppets'.\\nAn angry cafe owner meanwhile turned down cash from members of the group after they had a whip round.\\nThe man claimed he had lost business because of Insulate Britain, prompting each protester to give him \u00a310.\\nHowever, the furious owner refused to take the cash, leading to a row just off the busy motorway.\\nHe said: 'You can't have a whip round for me. What about the other thousands of people that are on the motorway? You've destroyed all their businesses.'\\nAnother frustrated driver said: 'Can this protest on the M25 just not?? Both days we have travelled and are traveling and they do it both those days.'\\nWhile a male driver said: 'You know the people stuck on the M25 due to protests. I'm one of them. Have just had my most public 'toilet' ever, but took a standing ovation from the traffic jam and the rubber neckers!'\\n\\nHowever, president of motoring insurance group AA, Edmund King, said that during the last Insulate Britain blockade, a thermal insulation engineer was prevented from going to work after being stuck in the traffic queue.\\nOn Wednesday he said: 'Whilst most people understand the need to take action on climate change, these motorway blockade tactics are just backfiring as they are alienating the working public stuck in this chaos and subsequently pumping out more emissions.\\n'It is somewhat ironic that thermal insulation engineers trying to insulate Britain were stuck in the congestion caused by Insulate Britain. Essential deliveries, emergency services, people missing hospital and business appointments are all hit by these blockades. Hopefully the police will take immediate action to unblock the arteries of Britain.'\\nA Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: 'We are currently dealing with an incident near Junction 1 of the A1M southbound. Officers are at the scene. The road has been closed and as a result there is some traffic congestion. Motorists are asked to please avoid the area where possible.'\\nIn a statement, an Insulate Britain spokesman said: 'The world is burning and burning, each year worse than the last. They are disrupting not just today or this week but the next hundred thousand years - for ever.\\n'This country is facing the greatest crisis ever and we are told to plant trees and do the recycling. We can take the lies no longer. We are not stupid. We are not children. We will no longer tolerate this dishonesty. We demand credible action now.\\n'Proper jobs for hundreds of thousands of people to start the first real step - to insulate all the homes of this country - which pound for pound gives us the biggest reduction in carbon emissions.\\n'It is a total no-brainer and yet this Government refuses to get on with the job. This is criminal negligence.\\n'We have decided there is something more important than our fears. We have a quiet, iron determination now. We are here to do our duty - to fulfil our responsibilities to our grandparents and their parents who gave their lives to preserve our way of life. To our children and the next thousand generations who will curse us for eternity if we do not act.\\n'We will keep going until the Government responds.'\\nThe activist speaking to LBC's Nick Ferrari said:\u00a0'The United Nations have made it very very clear that humanity is in a code red, which means that emissions - global emissions - are rising. I do believe that insulating the housing stock of the UK is the most cost-effective way to reduce those emissions.\\n'History has shown that breaking the law peacefully and causing disruption - with Martin Luther King, the Suffragettes and Gandhi - that these are the most effective tactics to get change to happen quickly.'\\nThe failure of police to immediately arrest protesters who blocked five junctions of the M25 for up to four hours sparked fury this week.\\nYesterday Richard Madeley\u00a0accused the original M25 eco mob of 'fascism' for 'blocking out reality' in an angry clash with an activist - as motorists trying to haul away protesters were called 'heroes' amid anger at the slow police response.\\nElectrician\u00a0Liam Norton, 36, who did not take part in the protest but was one of the organisers, went head to head with the Good Morning Britain\u00a0host yesterday morning as he attempted to justify the disruptive roadblocks as a means of protecting the planet.\\nHe said: 'Why do you think grannies are on the road yesterday? Why do you think that's happening? This is the way that has been proven to force the Government to act... the Government is not looking after their citizens, Richard.'\\nEmail jack.wright@mailonline.co.uk\\nBut Mr Madeley rejected the argument, saying: 'You're blocking out reality, aren't you? You're only seeing one aspect of reality. You're ignoring the reality of the individual.\\n'You're seeing the reality of the state, and that's fine, but you're seeing it at the expense of the reality of the individual, and that's fascism, I'm afraid.'\\nA video has emerged of officers protecting the law-breaking activists while dragging away an irate and incredulous driver who decided to take the law into his own hands.\u00a0The unnamed motorist tried to pull activists off the sliproad, believed to be at junction three for Swanley, Kent, as another man repeatedly yells at a policeman: 'I just don't understand why you won't move them'.\\nThe driver trying to break-up the protest and tear down banners was then dragged away by officers who then returned to guarding the members of Insulate Britain.\\nA second video showed another motorist trying to clear protesters\u00a0at junction 20 of the M25 at Kings Langley in Hertfordshire, leading some people to call him a 'hero' - although others warned about the dangers of vigilantism.\\nThere was also disruption and long queues at junction six for Godstone in Surrey, 14 for London Heathrow Airport, 20 for\u00a0Kings Langley in Hertfordshire and 31 for Purfleet in Essex near the Dartford Crossing.\u00a0There have been 92 arrests so far.\\nSurrey Police arrested 35 activists for a range of offences including highway obstruction - but all have now been released. A total of 15 were released on conditional bail while the rest were released pending investigation.\\nNo one has yet been charged, with the force saying they are collecting witness testimonies and dashcam footage to 'progress the investigation'.\\nInsulate Britain confirmed that electrician Liam Norton was not among those arrested.\\nObstruction of a British road 'without lawful authority or excuse' is an offence under Section 137 of the Highways Act 1980, with a punishment of a\u00a0fine and up to six months in prison.\\nYet at Junction 14 of the M25, close to Heathrow, it took four hours to arrest the activists and reopen the road at one of the busiest stretches of motorway in the UK.\\nWith police again accused of being too scared of tackling climate change activists, one critic tweeted: 'Public servants stand by while the public do the job they are paid for.\\n'This bl**dy country at times is just beyond. They were happy to arrest people for going for a walk or stopping on a bench for a coffee'.\\nAnother wrote: 'If the police won't enforce the law then that leaves no choice but to do it ourselves.\\n'These climate change imbeciles have no legal basis upon which to block the highway especially as such nonsense could potentially hold up emergency services and cost lives'.\\nOfficers from Kent, Surrey, Essex, Hertfordshire and the Metropolitan Police dealt with the incidents that caused delays of up to four hours at rush hour.\\nMany questioned why it took up until Midday to break-up protests that began at 8am.\\nA former chief constable said the protest was 'extraordinarily dangerous', while motorists - some of whom were stuck in traffic for three hours with young children - said it was 'madness', with one urging police: 'Move them.'\\nThe Metropolitan Police said it took action 'to ensure disruption was minimised' while the Hertfordshire force insisted it 'quickly mobilised resources to the scene'.\\nAA president Edmund King said: 'This action is not only incredibly dangerous in potentially putting lives at risk, but it also backfires in environmental terms by causing more delays and more vehicle emissions.\\n'These are some of the busiest sections of the M25 where tens of thousands of drivers will have been affected and it has a negative knock-on effect on economic activity.'\\nA Surrey Police spokesman said: 'We were called to Junction 6 and Junction 14 of the motorway just after 8am following reports that a number of people were protesting on behalf of Insulate Britain.\\n'A total of 35 people were arrested on suspicion of various offences, including public nuisance, obstructing the highway and conspiracy to cause danger to road users.\\nThey were taken to custody, with 15 released on conditional bail while the rest have been released under investigation pending further enquiries.'\\nWhat the officer said:\\n'Right, I have spoken to officers about what offences are available to them. Individual officers will come and speak to you and they will make their own decision as to whether you are arrested for failing to comply with Section 14.\\n'Each individual officer will come and speak to you and if you've got any questions at all, just ask and if any of you are in any discomfort or need anything, just let me know and we'll try and sort you out in a nice way.\\n'Couldn't have phrased that any worse could I? But no, if you need any assistance at all, just let me know okay?\\n'Right, we'll be as we are.'\\nIn another video, a single police officer was filmed strolling onto the motorway as protesters sat with their hands glued to the road.\\nHe said: 'Anybody organising it? Who's the organiser here? No one?\\n'Okay, I'm going to have to ask you all to move as you are blocking the highway.\\n'Anybody want to admit to being part of this?\\n\\nIronically, Mr Hallam owns a farmhouse which was described as 'poorly insulated' in an official energy performance certificate. His 2,000 sq ft farmhouse in Carmarthen, South Wales, was given the lowest possible energy rating on the certificate. It is unclear if Mr Hallam has taken steps to improve the rating since it was issued six years ago.\\nAsked about the certificate last night, a spokesman for the group said: 'This is the point \u2013 UK homes are the leakiest in Europe, with many millions of families being unable to afford the advice and help needed to insulate the building they live in.'\\nJoining Mr Hallam was David McKenny, 38, from Cambridge, who was one of six XR protesters who 'doorstepped' TV wildlife expert Sir David Attenborough, 95, at the height of pandemic after he criticised their tactics. The group posted a letter through Sir David's door as he isolated due to his age last year.\\nVegan business coach Zoe Cohen, 51, from Lymm, Cheshire, said she joined yesterday's action to demand 'real action' from ministers. She was involved in XR's takeover of central London last month.\\nMs Cohen said then: 'We are more scared of the reality of what this system is doing to ending life on Earth and ending our future and our children's future than we are of spending a night in a cell.' She describes herself as a 'carbon literate coach' and 'XR catalyser' on social media.\\nJanine Eagling, 60, from London, helped to block the M25 and A13 junction yesterday. She has been involved with XR since 2018, helping to form blockades across Waltham Forest.\\nThe IT project manager describes herself online as a 'world citizen' and 'rebel' as well as a cyclist, walker and gardener. She has overseen IT projects at top universities and was part of a campaign to improve safety for cyclists in the capital.\\nLiam Norton, 36, a London electrician who helped organise the protest, said he was 'shocked at the lack of significant action from our Government'.\\nHe became involved in climate activism in 2018 when he helped blockade five bridges in the capital and went on to join XR's 'actions team', which is responsible for planning civil disobedience. He was convicted over blocking printing presses last year.\\nHe delayed court proceedings by gluing himself to a table. It took three hours for police to remove him and the stunt is thought to have cost the taxpayer thousands of pounds.\\nHe told Good Morning Britain: 'The government is not looking after their citizens. We are.\\n'We've got a plan to insulate Britain that gives you the best value for money in terms of reducing emissions. Hundreds of thousands of meaningful jobs will be created.'\\nAnother protester, Steve Gower, 54, from Gloucester, is unemployed but describes himself as a volunteer advocate for the homeless and is an active Unite union campaigner.\\nLast summer Gower was\u00a0ordered to pay \u00a3267 by a magistrate after he\u00a0dropped a cigarette in the street while visiting a Jobcentre. He said that the fine spiralled because he couldn't afford the reduced fine of \u00a375 and was told there was no opportunity to pay in instalments.\\nHe was joined at the M25 road blockage by Eli Rose, 26, who spent 16 days in a tree last September to protest the HS2 rail link.\\nMs Rose lived in the tree in Parliament Square because she 'cannot bear' knowing her potential future children will be born 'into a world where they will have to battle through food shortages and drought.'", "image": [["Priti Patel last night ordered police to take 'decisive action' against 'selfish' eco-warrior

Until there are real consequences for ineptitude, we stay in the same patterns that are rife with racism and misogyny.'\\nDespite Dame Cressida's various controversies, Ms Patel and Mr Khan have have decided she should stay in the role, the\u00a0Evening Standard reports.\\nIt is believed there will be a formal announcement this month if Dame Cressida accepts the offer.\\nAnother two years would mean she will have served as commissioner for twice as long as predecessor Lord Hogan-Howe.\\nThe controversial police chief's five-year contract ends in April but she is understood to want an extension in the top police job.\\nBut there have been demands for her to step down and not be given any further time in the job. The Guardian reported last month a decision was 'imminent'.\\nThe Met chief has been caught up in a string of controversies including her handling of the Operation Midland scandal, her force's woeful security operation at the Euro 2020 final and allegations of a 'cover up' culture at Scotland Yard.\\nIn June, an official report branded the Met 'institutionally corrupt' and accused Dame Cressida of trying to thwart an inquiry into the unsolved murder of private eye Daniel Morgan. She has rejected the key findings.\\nFormer Tory MP Harvey Proctor, who lost his home and job over the Met's disastrous Operation Midland probe into spurious child sex abuse allegations, said last month: 'She is a disgrace and should have resigned long ago.\\n'It is time for her to go because of Operation Midland, not to be seeking any extension to her employment at the Met.'\\nMr Proctor, who received \u00a3900,000 from the Met in compensation and legal costs over the fiasco, added: 'I hold her culpable for her role in a severe waste of public funds which severely impacted a number of lives, including mine.'\\nDame Cressida, 60, who was formally made a dame commander by Prince Charles this year, has indicated she was 'happy' to remain in the top job.\\nSpeaking after the ceremony at St James's Palace, she said: 'I'm very focused on my job, I love my job, it's a huge honour.'\\nThe Mail has learned that a significant number of serving senior officers are deeply unhappy with Dame Cressida\u2019s \u2018hands off\u2019 leadership style and her \u2018head in the sand\u2019 response to criticism of her and her inner circle.\\nDame Cressida\u2019s apparent determination to secure a contract extension poses a potentially tricky political problem for Mr Johnson, who may not want to be seen to be ousting Scotland Yard\u2019s first female chief.\\nHe was criticised in October 2008 when, in one of his first acts as London mayor, he fired gaffe-prone Met commissioner Sir Ian Blair \u2013 one of Dame Cressida\u2019s remaining cheerleaders.\\nThe PM dodged questions about her future in a radio interview last month.\\nMet assistant commissioner Neil Basu is tipped to replace Dame Cressida when she stands down.\\nShooting dead of Tube passenger in 2005\\nCressida Dick was Gold Commander in charge of the operation which resulted in an innocent man being shot dead on July 22, 2005.\\nSurveillance officers searching for those responsible for the failed terror attacks the day before shot Brazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes after he entered Stockwell underground station.\\nTwo years later the Met was found guilty of a series of errors around the tragedy, although Dame Cressida was exonerated.\\nShe continued to support her officers saying they had acted in accordance with information they had at the time. Sources have described the control room where the ill-fated operation was run as 'utterly chaotic'.\\n'Culture of cover up' over fantastist Nick\\nOperation Midland resulted in the targeting of high-profile individuals after a fantasist falsely claimed he was the childhood victim of a paedophile ring.\\nTaking the preposterous claims of Carl Beech \u2013 aka 'Nick' \u2013 at face value, Met officers searched the homes of former Tory MP Harvey Proctor, Lord Bramall the former chief of defence staff, and Lady Brittan, widow of the former Tory home secretary Leon Brittan.\\nOperation Midland collapsed in March 2016. No charges or arrests were made. Beech was later convicted of fraud and perverting the course of justice and sentenced to 18 years in prison.\\nAn inquiry by retired high court judge, Sir Richard Henriques, found more than 40 failings in the police operation.\\nA subsequent damning report revealed that the Met had delayed implementing most of the reforms and Dame Cressida, who had been briefly involved in the original operation as assistant commissioner, faced pressure to resign.\\nSir Richard later called for a criminal investigation into five detectives and said confidence in the criminal justice system had been damaged.\\nAmid allegations of a Met cover-up, Home Secretary Priti Patel is under mounting pressure to instigate a series of new independent inquiries into Midland.\\nDame Cressida is not out of the woods on this one. In a bombshell interview in the Mail in February, Lady Brittan threw the book at the Met over its 'culture of cover up and flick away' under the Commissioner, who has repeatedly defended Steve Rodhouse, the serial bungling senior officer in charge of Midland. Further developments on the Midland scandal are expected in the coming weeks.\\nEasy ride for eco mob\\nIn 2019, much of Britain was amazed as thousands of climate change protesters brought central London to a standstill.\\nRoads around Parliament Square, Waterloo Bridge, Oxford Circus and Marble Arch were blocked for days but the police seemed powerless to intervene.\\nDame Cressida later said that Extinction Rebellion came in larger numbers than expected and used new tactics, but admitted police should have responded quicker.\\nAxe death corruption\\nIn 1987, private detective Daniel Morgan was found dead in a car park with an axe embedded in his head.\\nNo one has ever been convicted over his killing.\\nLast month, the Met was described as 'institutionally corrupt' and Dame Cressida herself was personally censured for obstruction following an eight year independent inquiry.\\nShe was named as one of those responsible for delaying the panel's access to the police database.\\nLast week Mr Morgan's brother Alastair called on her to resign.\\nGun cop abducts and murders Sarah Everard\\nWhen PC Wayne Couzens pleaded guilty last week to the murder of Sarah Everard, Dame Cressida described his actions as a crime that had 'sickened, angered and devastated' the Met.\\nCouzens, a former diplomatic protection officer, abducted Miss Everard, 33, from a south London street in March.\\nIt later emerged 12 police officers allegedly failed to investigate previous incidents of indecent exposure by Couzens.\\nA key question, which Dame Cressida needs to answer, is how was an individual like Couzens accepted into the Met. What vetting did, or didn't, take place?\\nShe also faced criticism over whether the Met acted in a 'heavy-handed' manner arresting women at a vigil for Miss Everard on Clapham Common.\\nA report by Sir Thomas Winsor, the chief inspector of constabulary later concluded that Met officers had acted 'lawfully, sensitively and proportionately'.\\nQuestions over her top brass\\nDame Cressida has made a number of highly questionable senior appointments since taking charge of the Met four years ago.\\nShe brought Sir Stephen House out of retirement to be her deputy three years after he stepped down as Chief Constable of Scotland after a series of controversies.\\nHe is seen as her key enforcer and protector, as is Helen Ball, another key ally who is one of her assistant commissioners.\\nMs Ball has been by accused by Harvey Proctor of blocking legitimate complaints about Operation Midland.\\nIncredibly Dame Cressida also promoted a senior officer found guilty of bullying at Essex Police, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matthew Horne, to be head of professional standards.\\nSelfies taken beside bodies\\nAfter the sickening, random murders of sisters Bibaa Henry, 46, and Nicole Smallman, 27, in a park in Wembley last June, Dame Cressida admitted there was 'much more to be done' to improve trust in the force.\\nOfficers were not sent out to look for the women, pictured, until 36 hours after they were last seen alive.\\nEven more appallingly, two police have also been charged over taking selfies with the women's bodies when they were supposed to be guarding the crime scene.\\nThe women's mother, Mina Smallman, a retired archdeacon, said police had 'made assumptions' about her daughters because they were black.\\nLast week, Danyal Hussein, 19, was convicted at the Old Bailey of the women's murders.\\n", "image": [["Dame Cressida Dick is expected to be offered another two years as chief of the Metropolitan Police despite being blamed for a series of blunders, reports say", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/08/12/47652091-0-image-a-26_1631102399455.jpg"], ["Home Secretary Priti Patel (pictured) is said to be arranging the extension while London Mayor Sadiq Khan is reportedly supportive of the move", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/08/13/47652719-9969531-image-m-46_1631103153819.jpg"], ["Pictured: Mr Khan yesterday", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/08/13/47652725-9969531-image-m-48_1631103163709.jpg"], ["Dame Cressida also faced criticism over whether the Met acted in a 'heavy-handed' manner arresting women at a vigil, pictured, for Miss Everard on Clapham Common", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/08/16/45453865-9969531-She_also_faced_criticism_over_whether_the_Met_acted_in_a_heavy_h-a-17_1631115168969.jpg"], ["Met assistant commissioner Neil Basu (pictured) is tipped to replace Dame Cressida when she stands down", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/08/13/47652921-9969531-image-a-51_1631103448622.jpg"], ["Surveillance officers searching for those responsible for the failed terror attacks the day before shot Brazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/08/14/45454413-9969531-Surveillance_officers_searching_for_those_responsible_for_the_fa-a-9_1631106189894.jpg"], ["In 2019, much of Britain was amazed as thousands of climate change protesters brought central London to a standstill", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/08/14/45454415-9969531-In_2019_much_of_Britain_was_amazed_as_thousands_of_climate_chang-a-7_1631106189848.jpg"], ["In 1987, private detective Daniel Morgan, pictured, was found dead in a car park with an axe embedded in his head", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/08/14/45454001-9969531-In_1987_private_detective_Daniel_Morgan_pictured_was_found_dead_-a-10_1631106189900.jpg"], ["Sisters Bibaa Henry, 46, and Nicole Smallman, 27, were murdered in a park in Wembley last June", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/08/14/45454035-9969531-Sisters_Bibaa_Henry_46_and_Nicole_Smallman_27_were_murdered_in_a-a-15_1631106189920.jpg"]], "author": ["James Gant", "James Tapsfield Political Editor For Mailonline"], "date": "2021-09-08"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10018513/Heroin-dealer-sickened-veterans-Cenotaph-demo-Insulate-Britain-rabble.html": {"title": "Insulate Britain rabble revealed: Convicted heroin dealer who sickened veterans with Cenotaph demo, vicar 'protesting for God', 'brickie' with \u00a31m properties and teacher married to ex-BBC bigwig are among the usual suspects bringing misery by closing M25", "subtitle": "Donald Bell angered war heroes by staging a climate change protest on Remembrance Sunday last November.

I knew he was serious about saving the planet but have not seen him since he retired.'\\nAnother activist spotted at multiple protests over the last week-and-a-half is Louise Lancaster. The 55-year-old from Cambridge\u00a0describes herself as 'a mother, a teacher, a world citizen', who is 'ready to step up for our planet and social justice'. She is married to Tim, a former technology director at the BBC.\\nMeanwhile, brickie Joshua Smith was branded a hypocrite after it emerged he owned a multi-million pound property empire - but the homes had poor insulation, an issue at the heart of the group's agenda.\\nThe 28-year-old is heir to a \u00a32million property empire and also has a seven-figure portfolio of his own. However, at least six\u00a0homes owned by his Oldham-based company have efficiency ratings of E or F, according to the Sun.\\nThis means the properties boast little or no insulation and also produce large quantities of extra carbon dioxide.\\nAnother activist, Louis McKechnie, a 20-year-old mechanical engineering student from Weymouth, has been seen at other protests across the country in the recent past.\\nThis included one in Poole, Dorset in May, where he sat in the road wearing a sign reading: 'I'm terrified to have children because of the climate crisis.'\\nHe has been joined on the motorways by\u00a0Oxford graduate and musician Mr Onley, who has worked as an English teacher at four schools, including educating a large group of Pakistani youngsters.\\nOriginally from Exmouth, Devon, he regularly shares details of demonstrations and rallies and is a member of environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth.\\nAlso present has been IT project manager and bike instructor Janine Eagling, who describes\u00a0herself as a 'world citizen, rebel, cyclist, walker, gardener, resourceful.'\\nThe 50-year-old has owned a consultancy firm, now registered in Walthamstow, north London, since 2014.\\nLondon-based yoga teacher Stefania Morosi is another of the campaigners whose backgrounds have emerged this evening.\\nThe 43-year-old, who previously studied in Italy and Sweden, describes herself as a 'tight rope acrobat, Etymology enthusiast, self proclaimed Poet and Activist'.\\nElsewhere, retired doctor and portrait painter, Bing Jones, from Sheffield, has insisted he is 'willing to go to prison' for the cause after being arrested four times in the space of just eight days during the protests.\\nThe details have emerged after the eco-zealots today\u00a0thwarted an injunction that could see them chucked in jail by descending on the Home Office.\\nActivists descended on the government building in Marsham Street, central London, where they blocked the road, lit a fire and burned documents including their bail release papers \u2013 acts that dodge the court order which only covers the M25.\\nThe group, including many who have been seen at multiple demos in the last week, sat brandishing homemade signs with messages such as: 'Please act now.'\\nOthers brazenly gave their names and jobs as Xavier Gonzalez, a trimmer, Janine Eagling, a bike instructor, and Stefania Morosi, a yoga teacher.\\nIt comes after Grant Shapps revealed a judge granted the injunction last night following a week of chaos on major highways.\\nThe Transport Secretary said the anarchists will face contempt of court and potentially be locked up if they continue their antics.\\nHome Secretary Priti Patel hailed the 'important' move and said it will mean 'people can get moving' on the busy road again.\\nMr Shapps and Ms Patel had earlier vowed to crack down on the Extinction Rebellion splinter group and were\u00a0said to be 'furious' at the protesters.\\nBut the limited scope of the injunction was quickly realised by the eco-warriors as they simply moved to other roads the order does not cover.\\nA spokesman for the group said:\u00a0'We have to move quickly. What we do, I believe, in the next three to four years will determine the future of humanity.\\n'For ten days now, campaigners from Insulate Britain have been blocking motorways to urge our government to make a meaningful statement we can all trust on insulating and retrofitting the houses of this country.\\n'Doing anything less would be a betrayal of any UK government's first duty: to protect the British people. We urge you to ensure this meaningful statement is made swiftly so ordinary people can stop blocking roads.\\n'But, if you believe, as you say, that our acts are outrageous and illegal, and if you believe there is no right of necessity for citizens to cause disruption to prevent the infinitely greater threat of destruction to our economy and way of life, then you have a duty to act decisively.\\n'The offence of creating a public nuisance is already there to be used, you didn't need an injunction. Take us to court, charge us, and put us in prison.'\\nHe added: 'Alternatively, if you think we have a case, you have a responsibility to the country to at least meet and talk with us.\\n'And you will find we are entirely reasonable in our demands which will save the lives of 8500 from fuel poverty this winter. We want to stop the roadblocks as much as you.\\n'The climate crisis is the biggest threat to Britain in its long history. It requires decisive action. The country is waiting to see if you have what it takes.'\\nAnnouncing the injunction via Twitter this morning, Mr Shapps said: 'Invading a motorway is reckless and puts lives at risk.\\n'I asked National Highways to seek an injunction against M25 protestors which a judge granted last night. Effective later today, activists will face contempt of court with possible imprisonment if they flout.'\\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said the 'important injunction' would mean 'people can get moving again' on the M25. She added: 'We will not tolerate lives being put at risk. Those who continue to do so risk imprisonment.'\\nBut\u00a0Insulate Britain\u00a0indicated that they will continue blocking the M25 despite the injunction. It said in a statement earlier today that 'right now our campaign goes on'.\\nThe two Cabinet ministers last night vowed to get tough with the protesters, revealing in the Daily Mail they had instructed officials to sought the injunction.\\nHome Secretary Miss Patel and Transport Secretary Mr Shapps condemned the 'arrogant' protesters and promised decisive action to stop them.\\nThe injunction was requested by National Highways in the High Court. It means protesters will face arrest and a potential instant jail term for contempt of court.\u00a0The legal case is likely to focus on the danger to road users.\\nA source said:\u00a0'Priti and Grant are furious that the lives of\u00a0the law-abiding majority are continuing to be disrupted by the actions of an extreme minority.'\\n'They 100 per cent back National Highways to take legal action against these individuals to ensure those who the police arrest are not released on bail and able to return to disrupting and endangering people's lives in this way.'\\nThe topic was raised in the Commons during PMQ's today, as\u00a0Labour MP Steve McCabe said: 'This is grossly dangerous and irresponsible behaviour and I hope these people will come to their senses.'\\nHe suggested 'those who are successfully prosecuted receive a sentence which ensures they're put to work helping to insulate the homes of those less fortunate than themselves'.\\nJustice minister Kit Malthouse said: 'What a splendid idea.' He said the Government is investing 'significant amounts' encouraging people to take 'green measures' in their homes.\\nHe said: 'I think putting some of those individuals towards that effort - more than happy for them to come and have a look at the insulation in my roof which, you know, could always do with some improvement possibly. I think that's a jolly good idea.'\\nMr Malthouse also said in a separate answer that currently 'unfortunately the penalty that attaches to those offences (of blocking a public highway) is quite weak, shall we say'.\\nHe added: 'In the Police, Crime, Courts and Sentencing Bill that is coming there will be a strengthening of police powers to deal with this issue'.\\nLiberal Democrat Wera Hobhouse said: 'I want to express my support to every single police officer who helps to keep us safe and keep public order, and their safety is essential.\\n'But I also understand the side of the protesters who really feel that climate change is a threat to their future and we must make sure that the fundamental right to protest and assembly is protected. I worry that injunctions such as this will serve to pit the police against protesters.'\\nTory MP Huw Merriman said: 'The real tragedy of these morons on the motorway is that they set the cause of those of us who are trying to advance decarbonisation in the transport system back, and they also put lives at risk.'\\nHe welcomed the minister's statement and asked if the injunctions are not successful to look at legislation and linking fines to economic damage caused.\\nConservative MP Sir Robert Syms welcomed the action taken, and said: 'It's vital that we nip this in the bud.\\n'These people are dangerous and the consequence isn't necessarily those who can see them, it's for those miles back when the traffic comes to an instant halt could well be faced with death or injury.'\\nHe added: 'Let people demonstrate in a safe way but not on our roads.' Conservative Mr Philip Hollobone called the protesters 'eco-maniacs'.\\nHe supported the action being taken and said 'there's no greater supporter of the police than I, but I have been disturbed at how long it's taken the police to remove some of these protesters, especially in the early protests. I thought it was already an offence to block the Queen's highway?'\\nDUP MP Sammy Wilson said: 'I congratulate the Government on finally taking action against these hypocritical highway hoodlums who have caused misery to many people.'\\nMr Malthouse called the protest 'selfish' and said 'the great sadness is that it diminishes, not enhances the enthusiasm for the cause for which these protesters seemingly want to promote but are, by their actions, damaging.'\\nPlease email tips@dailymail.com\\nConservative MP Lee Anderson called for the police to have a zero-tolerance approach towards the protesters who have been blocking sections of the M25.\\nHe told MPs: 'This injunction is welcomed news. Does the minister agree with me the police should now adopt a zero-tolerance approach and as soon one as of these morons steps foot on the motorway they should be carted off in an electric police van and locked up in a fully insulated cell?'\\nMembers on both sides of the House erupted in laughter. Mr Malthouse replied: 'As it is usually the case in his forthright and direct manner, he puts his finger on the button.\\n'We are now seeing extremely swift action, police arriving on the scene within minutes. He will understand that it is tough for them to patrol the entirety of the motorway network and be there as fast as they can.\\n'I know in Kent, protesters were intercepted before they even got on the carriageway. But where do we want our police officers? It is in our neighbourhood, on our streets fighting crime?\\n'We don't want them patrolling the network, looking for these people and hopefully, this injunction will mean they can go back to do the job we expect of them.'\\nActivists were filmed making a death-defying dash on to the M25 just before 8am yesterday near Cobham in Surrey. Drivers were forced to slam on their brakes.\\nSome of the hardliners have been arrested five times over the past ten days, only to be released to return to block the motorway again.\\nDr Bing Jones, who has been detained by police four times, told the BBC: 'I accept that I put my life at risk. I don't really accept that we have put other lives at risk.\\n'The disruption weighs heavily on me but it is necessary. Insulating houses is by far the most cost-effective means of reducing carbon emissions within the UK and it could bring millions of people out of fuel poverty.'\\nSenior police officers said the risk to motorists was now 'very high' \u2013 yet the four forces dealing with the protests have charged only one activist.\\nSurrey Police said it first received a call at 7.57am and arrived on the scene in three minutes. The protesters held up banners saying 'Insulate Britain' and poured blue paint on the road before they were dragged away.\\nBy 8.17am both carriageways were cleared and open, with 38 arrests being made.\\nInsulate Britain chiefs have suggested protests could continue despite the Government getting an injunction against the group.\\nGrant Shapps revealed a judge granted the legal remedy last night following a week of chaos on major highways.\\nThe Transport Secretary said the anarchists will face contempt of court and potentially be locked up if they continue their antics.\\nInsulate Britain spokeswoman Zoe Cohen was asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme if the injunction will stop the protests from taking place.\\nShe replied: 'The people taking part in these actions understand that the risks they are taking are because that we have tried everything else to make the Government protect us from the predicted impacts of climate chaos.\\n'That involves the loss of all that we cherish, our society, our way of life and law and order.\\n'We're calling for the installation and whole house retrofitting of social housing by 2025 and all homes by 2030, because this is the most effective way to reduce emissions, save lives from fuel poverty.\\nAmong those involved was Sue Parfitt, 79, a retired vicar who had already been arrested at least once.\\nAn Insulate Britain spokesman said the group was aware of only one activist in custody \u2013 possibly over a breach of bail \u2013 and said no charges had been brought.\\nThey said the rise in gas prices 'increased the urgency' for change and the group would end its campaign in exchange for a 'meaningful commitment' to its demands for improved insulation in UK homes.\\nChief Superintendent Jerry Westerman of Surrey Police said the group had become 'reckless' and 'a change from what we have seen recently'.\\nWhile it is not possible to remand people in custody for obstructing the highway, he said the force was willing to 'use any kind of option to prevent crime happening'.\\nOther activists have been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, public nuisance and causing danger to road users.\\n'If we can find ways in the existing legal framework to prevent people coming back and repeatedly offending, we will absolutely use it, that is our aim, but there are some constraints,' Mr Westerman added.\\n'But we are looking at all of our options, and there may be some other things in the coming days and weeks that we are able to do that helps us in our in achieving our objectives.'\\nHis colleague Chief Inspector Mike Hodder added that the 'risk is very high when you are messing around on a motorway'.\\nA spokesman for the Met Police said: 'Those arrested have been released under investigation whilst the crime team fully investigate all lines of inquiry.'\\nA Surrey Police spokesman confirmed no one had been charged over the protests.\\nHertfordshire Police said it had made no charges but added 32 people had been issued with community protection notices, which can lead to fines if not breached.\\nKent Police said Alexander Rodger, 31, from Brighton, had been charged with criminal damage.\\nA Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said: 'Offences committed at a protest are often summary only and if the police have sufficient evidence they can charge those themselves without the need to come to us.'\\nThe activists are treated individually and the offences for which each can be held are relatively minor and in most cases do not carry a custodial sentence.\\nThis means that \u2013 even if they are charged \u2013 they will not be remanded in custody.\\nRingleader of Insulate Britain's M25 eco mob STORMS off GMB after clash with Susanna Reid and admitting he's failed to insulate his OWN home\\nThis is the moment an irate eco-warrior storms off national television after being challenged on his group's disruptive M25 protests.\\nInsulate Britain ringleader Liam Norton walked off Good Morning Britain mid-debate\u00a0 after a fiery clash with presenters\u00a0Susanna Reid and\u00a0Richard Madeley\u00a0today.\\nThe electrician, whose eco-mob are demanding the Government pay to insulate social housing, was irked after being called out on claims his own home is not properly insulated.\\nHe was also asked if he was worried about members of the group potentially being struck by a car while protesting on the M25 - to which he replied 'it's terrible isn't it'.\\nBut as the debate raged Norton became visibly frustrated, before eventually standing up and walking off the set.\\nAs he left, Madeley said: 'Bye,' before going on to mock Norton's comparison of the group's support to that of Winston Churchill.\\nNorton, an electrician, is one of the leading figures in Insulate Britain - an\u00a0Extinction Rebellion off-shoot campaigning the Government\u00a0to reduce home heating emissions to zero.\\nThe group have infuriated motorists by blocking the M25 on five occasions in a bid to put pressure on the Government to pay for all social housing to be fully insulated.\\nHowever it was revealed last week that Norton's own property is not insulated.\\nNorton's property is owned by a housing association - and would be the sort of property he is campaigning to improve.\\nBut asked why he had not insulated the property himself, he said: 'Whether or not my home is insulated doesn't change the fact that millions of people's homes are not insulated.'\\nHis response sparked a bemused Susannah Reid, to ask: 'So you are saying you would risk your life, your life, for Insulate Britain, but you aren't going to insulate your own home?'\\nBut Norton replied: 'What we are talking about is the future of our country. Our country is going to be destroyed if we don't get this sorted out.'\\nAsked again why he had not insulated his home. He replied: 'You know insulation\u00a0 costs thousands, tens of thousands.'\\nAsked if he could not afford this, Norton said: 'No, what I'm saying is millions of people around the country cannot afford to do it.'\\nWe WILL use jail to end this motorway chaos: The protesters have broken the law and alienated the public, the Government will be giving police powers to stop such guerrilla tactics, say PRITI PATEL and GRANT SHAPPS\\nBut the Insulate Britain activists who have brought large sections of the M25 to a standstill in recent weeks have achieved the precise opposite.\\nThey have broken the law, undermined the cause they believe in, alienated the public, and created extra pollution, in one of the most self-defeating environmental protests this country has ever seen, particularly as we all strive so hard to rebuild after 18 months of the pandemic.\\nTransport is so crucial to that recovery. With every day that passes, our roads and railways are helping more businesses to grow, and more people to find jobs.\\nPunishing motorists to make a point about home insulation makes absolutely no sense at all.\\nAs one van driver caught up in the chaos told a protester: 'You are making people hate you.'\\nThe police have our full support to take decisive action and we're working with National Highways to take legal action against the protesters to ensure they cannot keep disrupting and endangering people's lives in this way.\\nWe are giving them powers to better manage such guerrilla tactics in future.\\nIn the medium-term, the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill will put public nuisance on a statutory footing, ensuring there are appropriate sentences for the harm caused.\\nPeople will continue to be able to make their voices heard without disrupting the lives of others. Even before the most recent demonstrations, the Metropolitan Police said that the actions of Extinction Rebellion \u2013 of which Insulate Britain is an offshoot \u2013 had cost the UK taxpayer a staggering \u00a350million.\\nThe events of recent weeks \u2013 including the cleaning of blue paint which protesters pointlessly poured on to the road \u2013 will add to that already significant drain on public funds.\\nIt is also ironic that many of the cars that have been caught up in the queues and congestion around the M25 are electric, with zero carbon emissions.\\nThere are now over half a million such cars in the UK, benefitting from one of the largest rapid charging networks in Europe.\\nWhile Insulate Britain inflicts misery in its campaign of gesture politics, this government is getting on with the job of decarbonising our transport system by 2050.\\nThousands of new charge points will encourage motorists to go electric in the coming decade as we phase out diesel and petrol. It is changes like this that make the difference, not posturing by a tiny minority who are arrogant enough to believe only they care about climate change.\\nWe all agree that climate change must be tackled. But this sort of behaviour achieves nothing.\\nIt puts drivers at risk \u2013 and idling cars actually increase pollution. While this group of eco-warriors parade for the cameras, we are getting on with the job of delivering our ambitious targets.\\nWe will not stand by and allow a small minority of selfish demonstrators to cause massive and dangerous disruption to the lives of the hard-working majority.", "image": [["Donald Bell was back to his climate change antics today when he joined around 60 other protesters in

Ms Rose lived in the tree in Parliament Square because she 'cannot bear' knowing her potential future children will be born 'into a world where they will have to battle through food shortages and drought.'\\nShe said that police didn't let anyone pass food or water to her for two days which made her feel ill but she added: 'Some of the protesters were doctors and enabled antibiotics to be tied on to a rope.'\\nThe pair were among 60 other Extinction Rebellion activists who were arrested during the mayhem along the M25 today.\\nObstruction of a British road 'without lawful authority or excuse' is an offence under section 137 of the Highways Act 1980, with a punishment of a fine and up to six months in prison. Yet at junction 14 of the M25, it took four hours to arrest the activists and reopen the road at one of the busiest stretches of motorway in the UK.\\nAnd the failure of police to immediately arrest\u00a0climate change\u00a0protesters sparked fury today as a video emerged of officers protecting the law-breaking activists while dragging away an irate and incredulous driver who decided to take the law into his own hands.\\nThe unnamed motorist tried to pull activists off the sliproad, believed to be at junction three for Swanley, Kent, as another man repeatedly yells at a policeman: 'I just don't understand why you won't move them'.\\nThe driver trying to break-up the protest and tear down banners was then dragged away by officers who then returned to guarding the members of Insulate Britain, a new offshoot of\u00a0Extinction Rebellion.\\nThere was also disruption and long queues at junction six for Godstone in Surrey, 14 for London Heathrow Airport, 20 for\u00a0Kings Langley in Hertfordshire and 31 for Purfleet in Essex.\u00a0There have been 92 arrests so far.\\nWith police again accused of being too scared of tackling climate change activists, one critic tweeted the video from this morning with the message: 'Public servants stand by while the public do the job they are paid for. This bl**dy country at times is just beyond. They were happy to arrest people for going for a walk or stopping on a bench for a coffee'.\\nAnother wrote: 'If the police won't enforce the law then that leaves no choice but to do it ourselves. These climate change imbeciles have no legal basis upon which to block the highway especially as such nonsense could potentially hold up emergency services and cost lives'.\\nOfficers from Kent, Surrey, Essex, Hertfordshire and the Metropolitan Police dealt with the incidents that caused delays of up to three hours at rush hour. Many questioned why it took up until midday to break-up protests that began at 8am.\\nA former chief constable said the protest was 'extraordinarily dangerous', while motorists - some of whom were stuck in traffic for three hours with young children - said it was 'madness', with one urging police: 'Move them.'\\nDrivers tried to remove a group\u00a0at Kings Langley as queues formed this morning. Hertfordshire Police then arrived but instead of arresting them immediately, around 50 officers guarded the group and set up a diversion.\\nAs well as taking aim at the police, drivers caught up in the chaos said that any sympathy they had for eco protesters had now 'gone' after they targeted drivers trying to get to work rather than the Government who make policies on the environment.\u00a0Despite the very public action this morning, a petition for the UK Government to 'Fund and require the insulation of all social housing by 2025' had reached just 1,300 signatures by 2.30pm.\\nOf the senior members of Insulation Britain, only unemployed Corbynista Steve Gower, 54, from Gloucester, has been involved in today's protests. He has been arrested, the organisation says.\\nA total of 92 people were arrested in connection with the incidents sparking chaos across five different police constabularies.\\nA ringleader of today's M25 protests is an unemployed Corbynite eco-warrior recently fined for tossing a cigarette outside his local Jobcentre because he was late for his appointment, MailOnline can reveal today.\\nOf the senior members of Insulation Britain, only Steve Gower, 54, from Gloucester, has been involved in today's protests. He has been arrested, the organisation says. They also say that 90 people took part in today's action and 78 of them were arrested.\\nMr Gower, who is unemployed but describes himself as a volunteer advocate for the homeless in his home city, is also an active Unite union campaigner.\\nLast summer he was\u00a0ordered to pay \u00a3267 by a magistrate after he\u00a0dropped a cigarette in the street while visiting the Job Centre.\\nMr Gower said that the fine spiralled because he couldn't afford the reduced fine of \u00a375 and was told there was no opportunity to pay in instalments.\\nMagistrates fined him \u00a3100 and ordered him to pay costs of \u00a3135 and a surcharge of \u00a342.\\nHe had dropped in Southgate Street by an employee of Gloucester City Council but didn't do so and was issued with a fixed penalty notice of \u00a3100 on Monday September 9 2019.\\nIn a statement read to the court Mr Gower said: 'On the way I rolled a cigarette and began smoking it, but when I realised the time I panicked about my appointment at the job centre and hastened my speed.\\n'About 20 yards from the entrance I was tapped on my shoulder and asked if I knew I dropped a cigarette.\\n'The official then started filling out paperwork and I asked 'Will this take long?'. I then told him he'd better follow me into the job centre so I wouldn't be sanctioned for being late. He interviewed me inside the job centre and gave me a copy of what he had written. I was so stressed at the time.'\\n\\nSurrey Police detained 36 people across two demonstrations at Junction 6 near Godstone and Junction 14 by Heathrow Airport.\\nThey remain in custody on suspicion of public nuisance and wilful obstruction offences after officers were called just before 8am.\\nA spokesman said: 'A total of 36 people have been arrested after we were called to protests at Junction 6 and Junction 14 of the M25 which were reported just before 8am today (September 13).\\n'The protesters were arrested on suspicion of public nuisance and wilful obstruction offences and are currently in custody.\\n'Protesters from Insulate Britain were at the two locations as part of a coordinated protest which has also affected other junctions of the motorway.\\n'Diversions were set up while officers dealt with the situation.\\n'Both Surrey junctions of the M25 are now fully reopened and we would like to thank motorists for their patience while we dealt with the situation.'\\nOfficers from the Met Police arrested a further 14 people for highway obstruction after they also 'quickly responded' to people blocking the Poyle Interchange at junction 14 near Heathrow Airport just after 8am.\\nA spokesman said: 'The Met chaired a cross-force and stakeholder meeting with a number of agencies today to share information, and co-ordinate activity to ensure disruption was minimised.\\n'We are working with colleagues at Heathrow Airport to establish what, if any, impact the protest had on the airport.'\\nThe co-ordinated demonstration on the roads network saw Hertfordshire Police arrest 18 people in connection with the protest at the Kings Langley interchange near junction 20 for Hemel Hempstead after demonstrators were removed for ignoring officers' requests to move.\\nSuperintendent Adam Willmot, of Herts Police, said: 'We were called to reports of a protest at around 8am today (Monday 13 September) and quickly mobilised resources to the scene.\\n'The M25 was closed westbound at junction 20, resulting in congestion and delays on both the M25 and the A41.\\n'Protestors ignored police requests to move location, so we took robust action to enable roads to be reopened and to remove the protestors causing obstructions.\\n'Our officers dealt with the disruption as quickly as possible, reopening routes for local businesses and residents.\\n'The road closures were lifted by 10.20am.'\\nEssex Police confirmed 12 people were arrested on suspicion of highways obstruction after climate protests blocked the Purfleet Interchange at Junction 31 for Lakeside on the Essex side of the Dartford Crossing shortly before 8.15am.\\nChief Inspector Paul Austin, of Essex Police, said: 'This incident caused significant disruption and our officers worked to resolve it as quickly and safely as possible.\\n'I want to thank the drivers affected for their patience and understanding.'\\nKent Police also arrested 12 people in connection with a blockade at the Swanley Interchange after officers attempted to engage with the activists.\\nA spokesman said: 'Twelve people have been arrested after a roundabout which connects with the M25 at junction 3, near Swanley, was obstructed.\\n'The individuals were detained on suspicion of obstructing a highway after Kent Police was called to reports a group of people had gathered at the scene at 8.10am on Monday 13 September 2021.\\n'They remain in custody as enquiries continue. The road was clear by around 11.40am.'\\nAngry motorists tried to pull\u00a0climate change protesters off the road today after they caused chaos across five different sections of the M25 by blocking junctions, lanes and slip roads during the morning rush hour.\\nNational Highways said there was also disruption at junctions three for Swanley in Kent, six for Godstone in Surrey, 14 for London Heathrow Airport's Terminal Five and 31 for Purfleet in Essex near the Dartford Crossing.\\nThe AA slammed the co-ordinated action as 'incredibly dangerous' and 'causing more delays and more vehicle emissions', with tens of thousands of drivers affected as they tried to get to work on the motorway this morning.\\nHertfordshire Police arrested 18 people at junction 20, which also caused delays on the A41, while Essex Police said 12 people were arrested at J31 on suspicion of highways obstruction. All five blockades had finished by noon.\\nAA president\u00a0Edmund King told MailOnline: 'This action is not only incredibly dangerous in potentially putting lives at risk but it also backfires in environmental terms by causing more delays and more vehicle emissions.\\n'These are some of the busiest sections of the M25 where tens of thousands of drivers will have been affected and has a negative knock-on effect on economic activity.'\\nInsulate Britain is an independent campaign launched on August 20 by members of Extinction Rebellion, who want the Government to reduce home heating emissions to zero.\\n\\nThe organisation has claimed that its demands for the Prime Minister were delivered to Downing Street by hand on August 21, but so far no-one from the Government has responded.\\nInsulate Britain's listed mailing address is a Victorian semi-detached house in Streatham, South London, constructed in 1882 and now worth \u00a31.5million.\\nThe group has been holding campaign meetings since June 29, and held gatherings over the weekend in Taunton as well as Bath and Bristol.\\nA spokesman said: 'We are demanding the Government and Boris Johnson create hundreds of thousands of jobs, lower our emissions, and save lives.'\\nThe group said that its actions would continue 'until the government makes a meaningful commitment to insulate Britain's 29million leaky homes'. It describes itself as 'a new group demanding that the Government gets on with the job of insulating Britain's homes'.\\nAmong their supporters are Ben Derbyshire, who is the former president of the Royal Institute for British Architects and a commissioner for Historic England.\\nThey have two main demands:\\nInsulate Britain is an independent campaign launched on August 20 by members of XR, who want the Government to reduce home heating emissions to zero.\\nOne protester from the organisation told LBC this morning: 'We are so, so sorry to disrupt people. We want to set the Government a really doable task.'\\nChristian Climate Action, which is a faith-based arm of XR, said that Christians including clergy were involved today, telling its Twitter followers: 'Prayers appreciated.'\\nBut former chief constable Sir Hugh Orde said: 'It's worth reminding ourselves these people tried to stop a live motorway running, that is extraordinarily dangerous. It puts their lives at risk, it puts motorists' lives at risks and it puts police officers' lives at risk.'\\nOne motorist, Sam, from Bromley, South East London, who did not wish to share his second name, said he has been stuck in the traffic on the M25 with his two young children for three hours due to the climate protest.\\nThe 37-year-old had been on his way for a day out at a farm on a 'rare day' he has time for a day trip with his family. He added:\u00a0'I am seething at how irresponsible and selfish their demonstration is.\\n'It is ill-considered and poorly executed. I am all for change and reducing fuel poverty but there are more sensible ways to lobby and protest.'\\nAsk how his young children, aged two years and six months, are coping having been in a car for so long, he added: 'We are managing but the whole thing is completely unnecessary.'\\nOther motorists vented their fury on social media today, with Bill Templer tweeting Surrey Police to say: 'Move them! We are stuck on M25.'\\nAnother, Linda Morgan, wrote on Twitter: 'Blocking the M25 on a Monday morning is madness. Majority of drivers aren't on there through choice.'\\nAnd a third, Kat, added: 'What about hospital workers getting to work? My husband goes via M25 - should he cancel his morning list?'\\nSupporters of the group include Ben Derbyshire, who is the former president of the Royal Institute for British Architects and a commissioner for Historic England.\\nHe said today: 'Britain has the leakiest and poorest performing housing in Europe that contributes 20 per cent of our total climate emissions.\\n'Instead of fiddling while Rome burns with a series of ill-thought through programmes, reliant on private investment and debt, Government needs to invest in a major programme of deep renovation for energy efficiency with measures to support the supply chain, hitherto endlessly messed around with by half-hearted and inconsistent subsidies.\\n'The cost benefits for health and well-being, unemployment, homelessness and delivery of a levelling-up programme (otherwise dependent on long term and grandiose transport projects) will pay back the investment amply.'\\nBut protester\u00a0Eli Rose, of St Albans, said:\u00a0'Insulating Britain will reduce heating bills for hard working families \u2013 particularly those low income families that have been hardest hit by the pandemic. It is a win-win-win. The Government know what needs to be done. They just need to get on and do it.'\\nAnd\u00a0Gwen Harrison, 43, from Hemel Hempstead, added:\u00a0'It's a no-brainer. Insulating Britain will reduce emissions, provide hundreds of thousands of jobs and stop our elderly dying in cold homes each winter. So stop messing about, Boris, and get on with the job.'\\nAlso among the protesters involved today was\u00a0Liam Norton, 36, an electrician from London, who said:\u00a0'Since waking up to the crisis we are all in, due to the catastrophic breakdown in our climate, I have been shocked at the lack of significant action from our government.\u00a0They need to face up to reality. It will destroy our economy and the fabric of our society. They are being incredibly reckless.\\n'They are betting the farm on technologies that don't exist.\u00a0A stitch in time saves nine which means if we spend money now we'll stop a catastrophe later down the line.\u00a0It's a no brainer. Insulating Britain will reduce emissions, provide hundreds of thousands of jobs and stop our elderly dying in cold homes each winter.\\n'So stop messing about, Boris, and get on with the job. As soon as a statement is made that we can trust and is meaningful we will get off the roads.'\\nZoe Cohen, 51, a self-employed mother from Warrington, Cheshire, added: 'It's now proven beyond all doubt, humans have broken the climate with the emissions from fossil fuels.\\n'The world my generation, and my parents' generation was born into has gone, and it's never coming back. The world's politicians need to be honest and accept this.\\n'They need to wake up and do what's necessary to stop the kids being on an escalator to climate hell. We need real action from our government to reduce emissions in this Parliament - 2050 is far too late.'\\nAn Insulate Britain spokesman said: 'We are demanding the Government and Boris Johnson create hundreds of thousands of jobs, lower our emissions, and save lives.'\\nThe organisation added that its actions would continue 'until the government makes a meaningful commitment to insulate Britain's 29million leaky homes'.\\nIt claimed that its demands for the Prime Minister were delivered to Downing Street by hand on August 21, but so far no-one from the Government has responded.\\nInsulate Britain's listed mailing address is a Victorian semi-detached house in Streatham, South London, constructed in 1882 and now worth \u00a31.5million.\\nThe group has been holding campaign meetings since June 29, and held gatherings over the weekend in the Somerset town of Taunton as well as Bath and Bristol.\\nIt describes itself as 'a new group demanding that the Government gets on with the job of insulating Britain's homes'.\\nThe group has two main demands - one is that 'the UK government immediately promises to fully fund and take responsibility for the insulation of all social housing in Britain by 2025'.\\nAnd the other is: 'That the UK government immediately promises to produce within four months a legally binding national plan to fully fund and take responsibility for the full low-energy and low-carbon whole-house retrofit , with no externalised costs, of all homes in Britain by 2030 as part of a just transition to full decarbonisation of all parts of society and the economy.'\\nAn Essex Police spokesman said: 'We are currently dealing with an incident near junction 20 (Hemel Hempstead) of the M25 involving a small number of protesters.\\n'Officers are at the scene. The M25 is currently closed at junction 20 westbound, and as a result there is heavy traffic on the A41. Motorists are advised to avoid the area where possible.'\\nChief Inspector Paul Austin added: 'This incident caused significant disruption and our officers worked to resolve it as quickly and safely as possible. I want to thank the drivers affected for their patience and understanding.'\\nRelating to the protest at junction six, a Surrey Police spokesman tweeted today: 'We're currently overseeing a protest at junction six M25 reported just before 8am.\\n'Number of protesters from Insulate Britain are at the location, slip road closed and diversion being set up. No arrests made at this stage. Please avoid the area.'\\nAnd\u00a0Kent Police said: 'Kent Police was called at 8.10am to a report a group of people were obstructing the road at a roundabout where the B1273, in Swanley, and junction 3 of the M25 meet.\\n'Officers are in attendance and are engaging with the individuals involved. A diversion, which will allow drivers to join the motorway at junction 4, is in place.\\n'Traffic is moving, but motorists are advised to expect delays and, if possible, use an alternative route.'\\nThe latest wave of XR protests in London which began last month saw 480 people arrested and 81 activists removed after gluing themselves to structures.\\n** Do you know any of the protesters? Please email: tips@dailymail.com **\\nORGANIC FARMER\\nRoger Hallam, 55, helped set up XR but left to advise Insulate Britain, which launched this summer. The organic farmer wants to 'bring down all the regimes in the world', starting with Britain, and believes those running society 'should have a bullet through their heads'. There have been allegations of a 'cult-like' following for the Welshman who compares his tactics to those of heroic activists Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King. He is said to have been inspired to take up climate activism after his farm in Wales went bust due to bad weather.\\nPUPPETEER\\nDavid McKenny, 38, from Cambridge, was one of six XR protesters who 'doorstepped' TV wildlife expert Sir David Attenborough, 95, at the height of pandemic after he criticised their tactics. The group posted a letter through Sir David's door as he isolated due to his age last year. Mr McKenny was jailed for 14 days for contempt after he glued himself to the dock and filmed officials at City of London Magistrates' Court in April. The community musician has taught puppeteering at the Royal Northern College of Music and performed it at Bath Spa University.\\nELECTRICIAN\\nLiam Norton, 36, a London electrician blocking drivers yesterday, said he was 'shocked at the lack of significant action from our Government'. He became involved in climate activism in 2018 when he helped blockade five bridges in the capital and went on to join XR's 'actions team', which is responsible for planning civil disobedience. He was\u00a0 convicted over blocking printing presses last year. He delayed court proceedings by gluing himself to a table. It took three hours for police to remove him and the stunt is thought to have cost the taxpayer thousands of pounds.\\nBUSINESS COACH\\nZoe Cohen, 51, from Lymm, Cheshire, called yesterday for 'real action' from ministers. The vegan business coach was involved in XR's takeover of central London last month. She said then: 'We are more scared of the reality of what this system is doing to ending life on Earth and ending our future and our children's future than we are of spending a night in a cell.' She describes herself as a 'carbon literate coach' and 'XR catalyser' on social media.\\nIT EXPERT\\nJanine Eagling, 60, from London, helped to block the M25 and A13 junction yesterday. She has been involved with XR since 2018, helping to form blockades across Waltham Forest. The IT project manager describes herself online as a 'world citizen' and 'rebel' as well as a cyclist, walker and gardener. She has overseen IT projects at top universities and was part of a campaign to improve safety for cyclists in the capital.", "image": [["Steve Gower, 54, pictured in a 'Team Corbyn' T-shirt from Gloucester, is one of the ringleaders of today's protests", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/14/02/47858619-9984953-Steve_Gower_54_pictured_in_a_Team_Corbyn_T_shirt_from_Gloucester-a-21_1631582363659.jpg"], ["Eli Rose (pictured), 26, spent 16 days in a tree last September to protest the HS2 rail link.

Other ringleaders included an organic farmer who compares himself to Mahatma Gandhi, a puppeteer, a vegan 'business coach' and a 'rebel' IT project manager.\\nPolice have been accused of failing to enforce the law after it was revealed that eco-extremists arrested for shutting down the M25 during the Monday morning rush hour were simply set free without bail conditions and allowed to do the same 48 hours later as officers again 'stood around for hours before doing anything'.\\nOne officer sparked outrage after she addressed a group of activists breaking the law by blocking the road and told them: 'If you have got any questions at all just ask. And if any of you are in any discomfort or need anything just let me know and we will try and sort you out in a nice way'.\\nThere have 181 arrests in total - for offences including public nuisance, obstructing the highway and conspiracy to cause danger to road users - but that figure includes those held twice in three days.\\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace today told LBC's Nick Ferrari that police should have acted 'more swiftly' to remove the assembled eco-mob who caused traffic chaos on one of Britain's busiest motorways.\\nHe said: 'I think that getting a swift resolution to those people sitting in the way of the M25 and not getting in the way of people, many people who are paid by the hour and don't have sympathetic bosses. Why should they lose their livelihood because somebody wants to sit in the middle of the road?'\\n\\nOne activist involved in Monday's demo even boasted to Nick Ferrari on LBC that he had been released by police and not prevented from protesting on Wednesday, comparing the cause to that of Martin Luther King, the Suffragettes and Mahatma Gandhi.\\nObstruction of a British road 'without lawful authority or excuse' is an offence under Section 137 of the Highways Act 1980.\\nPolice arrested a large number of the Insulate Britain activists under this law, but no one has been charged.\\nThere were also arrests for the common law offence of public nuisance, and conspiracy to cause danger to road users under section 22A of the Road Traffic Act 1988.\\nIf police had been given the Crown Prosecution Service's go ahead, they could have charged the activists with the obstruction offence and sent them to a magistrates' court where they could be punished with a fine and up to six months in prison.\\nThere would also be the option to arrest or charge them under an alternative law, such as obstructing emergency workers under the Emergency Workers (Obstruction) Act 2006 - the maximum penalty for which is a \u00a35,000 fine.\\nOfficers were also criticised for taking up to four hours to arrest the protesters even though they were clearly breaking the law under the obstruction of a road offence.\\nFurious Conservative MPs Ian Liddell-Grainger and Craig Mackinlay slammed police for 'standing around for hours at a time before doing anything' and urged officers to 'use the powers available to them to clear this protest immediately'. Mr Liddell-Grainger backed 'much tougher sentences' for 'arrogant and stuck-up' climate anarchists who 'cause immense harm to people's lives and livelihoods'.\\n'They should have a criminal record and everybody should be made aware of the damage and misery they cause,'\u00a0Mr Liddell-Grainger raged.\u00a0'Their whole plan, of sowing chaos to our lives in this way, just won't fly with the British public because they don't kowtow to bullies.\\n'They cannot be allowed to hijack the conversation by threatening to destroy livelihoods if they don't get their own way.\u00a0If they have a grievance, they should take it up with their Member of Parliament in the lawful, peaceful way. They can't just throw a tantrum and sit in the road at whatever cost to other people.\u00a0If they can't be adults in this conversation, they shouldn't be in the conversation at all.'\\nOn Monday and Wednesday, the same protesters freely blocked motorway junctions and roundabouts across the M25, A3 and Dartford Crossing - and remained free to do so before being arrested, hours later.\\nHome Secretary Priti Patel has remained silent over the protests despite mounting anger from Tory MPs, motorists and business affected by the chaos.\\nIn total, more than 165 arrests have been made by Kent, Hertfordshire, Surrey and Met police forces over the two days of action - but every activist appears to have been fallowed to walk free from custody and return to the road.\\nThe Met Police made 14 arrests yesterday, but refused to confirm to MailOnline whether those arrested remained in custody or had been let go again.\\nHertfordshire Police said 18 people were arrested for causing disruption on Wednesday - but confirmed they have already released under investigation and subject to community protection notice warnings.\\nA spokesperson for Surrey Police confirmed the force had arrested 32 people over Wednesday's action and said they were held in custody last night.\u00a0Kent Police has been contacted for comment.\\nA group on Twitter called UK Police Pensioners United accused officers of 'aiding and abetting' the M25 protest by 'slow reactions and decisions'. It said: 'None of the M25 forces covered themselves in glory.'\\nIf you want to complain about the police's handling of the protests, you can contact each of the four forces involved this week by clicking on the links below:\\nSurrey Police\u00a0-\u00a0Chief Constable Gavin Stephens\\nComplaints link:\u00a0Click here\\nEmail:\u00a0surreychiefconstable@surrey.pnn.police.uk\\nMetropolitan Police\u00a0-\u00a0Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick\\nComplaints Link:\u00a0Click here:\\nEmail:\u00a0Comm.PO@met.police.uk\\nKent Police -\u00a0Chief Constable Alan Pughsley\\nComplaints link:\u00a0Click here\\nEmail:\u00a0cc@kent.pnn.police.uk\\nHertfordshire Constabulary\u00a0- Chief Constable Charlie Hall)\\nComplaints link:\u00a0Click here\\nEmail: Charlie.hall@herts.pnn.police.uk\\nYou can also complain directly to the\u00a0Independent Office for Police Conduct watchdog - click here\\nAsked why police had failed to act sooner, the Home Office bizarrely said the chaos was a 'cross-government' matter for both itself and the Department of Business and Energy.\\nThe climate zealots yesterday boasted of being released after their arrest and despite demonstrating on Monday they were free to cause chaos for motorists again yesterday.\\nFarmer Roger Hallam, 55, who helped found Extinction Rebellion,\u00a0before leaving to joining protest organiser Insulate Britain, wants to 'bring down all the regimes in the world', starting with Britain, and believes those running society 'should have a bullet through their heads'.\\nThere have been allegations of a 'cult-like' following for the Welshman who compares his tactics to those of heroic activists Gandhi and Martin Luther King. He is said to have been inspired to take up climate activism after his farm in Wales went bust due to bad weather.\\nIronically, Mr Hallam owns a farmhouse which was described as 'poorly insulated' in an official energy performance certificate. His 2,000 sq ft farmhouse in Carmarthen, South Wales, was given the lowest possible energy rating on the certificate. It is unclear if Mr Hallam has taken steps to improve the rating since it was issued six years ago.\\nAsked about the certificate last night, a spokesman for the group said: 'This is the point \u2013 UK homes are the leakiest in Europe, with many millions of families being unable to afford the advice and help needed to insulate the building they live in.'\\nJoining Mr Hallam was David McKenny, 38, from Cambridge, who was one of six XR protesters who 'doorstepped' TV wildlife expert Sir David Attenborough, 95, at the height of pandemic after he criticised their tactics. The group posted a letter through Sir David's door as he isolated due to his age last year.\\nVegan business coach Zoe Cohen, 51, from Lymm, Cheshire, said she joined yesterday's action to demand 'real action' from ministers. She was involved in XR's takeover of central London last month.\\nMs Cohen said then: 'We are more scared of the reality of what this system is doing to ending life on Earth and ending our future and our children's future than we are of spending a night in a cell.' She describes herself as a 'carbon literate coach' and 'XR catalyser' on social media.\\nJanine Eagling, 60, from London, helped to block the M25 and A13 junction yesterday. She has been involved with XR since 2018, helping to form blockades across Waltham Forest.\\nThe IT project manager describes herself online as a 'world citizen' and 'rebel' as well as a cyclist, walker and gardener. She has overseen IT projects at top universities and was part of a campaign to improve safety for cyclists in the capital.\\nLiam Norton, 36, a London electrician who helped organise the protest, said he was 'shocked at the lack of significant action from our Government'.\\nHe became involved in climate activism in 2018 when he helped blockade five bridges in the capital and went on to join XR's 'actions team', which is responsible for planning civil disobedience. He was convicted over blocking printing presses last year.\\nHe delayed court proceedings by gluing himself to a table. It took three hours for police to remove him and the stunt is thought to have cost the taxpayer thousands of pounds.\\nHe told Good Morning Britain: 'The government is not looking after their citizens. We are.\\n'We've got a plan to insulate Britain that gives you the best value for money in terms of reducing emissions. Hundreds of thousands of meaningful jobs will be created.'\\nAnother protester, Steve Gower, 54, from Gloucester, is unemployed but describes himself as a volunteer advocate for the homeless and is an active Unite union campaigner.\\nLast summer Gower was\u00a0ordered to pay \u00a3267 by a magistrate after he\u00a0dropped a cigarette in the street while visiting a Jobcentre. He said that the fine spiralled because he couldn't afford the reduced fine of \u00a375 and was told there was no opportunity to pay in instalments.\\nHe was joined at the M25 road blockage by Eli Rose, 26, who spent 16 days in a tree last September to protest the HS2 rail link.\\nMs Rose lived in the tree in Parliament Square because she 'cannot bear' knowing her potential future children will be born 'into a world where they will have to battle through food shortages and drought.'\\nIt comes as officers took more than two-and-a-half hours to clear off climate protesters who were obstructing Britain's busiest motorway yesterday in videos that sparked fury online.\\nIn one clip, a female officer politely tells activists: 'If any of you have any questions, or are in any discomfort or need anything, just let us know' - while stricken motorists couldn't get to work, hospitals and appointments.\\nAnother video showed an officer standing with his hands in his pockets on his own and being met with silence after asking the demonstrators which of them had organised Wednesday's protest.\\nHe then told them, 'I'm going to have to ask you to move' before awkwardly leaving.\\nMeanwhile, police had to restrain incensed truck drivers who desperately tried to move eco-warriors who had glued their hands to the road.\\nChief Superintendent Richard Liversidge, of Herts Police, said: 'Police received calls alerting us to a protest near junction 1 (South Mimms) of the A1M shortly after 8am on Wednesday. Patrolling officers were at the scene by 8.08am and were faced with a challenging situation in which protestors had blocked the carriageway and glued themselves to the tarmac.\\n'Tasked with ensuring the safety of the wider public and those in the carriageway, they worked quickly to minimise disruption to motorists on the local and wider road network. Unavoidably, due to this group's actions, it took time to safely de-bond the protestors from the tarmac as well as ensure that the roads could be safely re-opened.\\n'Policing protests is complex, in part due to the operating environment, the number of people involved and the need for us to deploy specialist resources to resolve and manage the situation.\\n'There are clear, national standards regarding the policing of a protest which our officers were following. The powers we have are created by Parliament, and we use them fairly and proportionately.\\n'Comment has been made about the approach taken by my officers, and I would like to remind people that what they are seeing is a very short clip, depicting an officer engaging with the group and informing them that if they did not move off the road, they were going to be arrested, in line with standard procedure.\\n'This resulted in 18 arrests being made yesterday and a full investigation is underway. We understand the frustration regarding the traffic delays experienced but would ask that people understand that we did \u2013 and are doing \u2013 everything in our power to deal with the situation.'\\nDemonstrators from the\u00a0Extinction Rebellion offshoot protest group halted traffic near Junction 23 at South Mimms from 8am while another group shut down the main carriageway of the M25 anti-clockwise in Surrey between Junction 10 and Junction 8.\\nA 50-year-old woman was airlifted to hospital with serious injuries following a crash\u00a0at Junction 9 involving multiple vehicles. In a statement, Surrey Police said the investigation is ongoing and that 'it is too early to know' if the crash was caused by the protest. Traffic monitor Inrix said at around 2pm that there was a six-mile traffic queue on the M25 following the accident.\\nA third group glued their hands to the road on Junction 1b near the Dartford Crossing. Demos also took place at Junction 25 on the M25, the A10 in Hertfordshire and Junction 10 of the A3 in Surrey. By around 9.30am, the group had blocked traffic in five locations.\\nThe junctions targeted by climate demonstrators this week were:\\nThe junctions targeted by the eco-mob on Monday were:\\n\\nMr Mackinlay told MailOnline:\u00a0'The M25 is one of the busiest roads in the country and a key artery powering the economy of London and the South East. It is little wonder that this new group, 'Insulate Britain' have chosen it for their pathetic protest.\\n'Putting aside the fact that the Government has and in allocating more grant funding for the measures they are campaigning for than ever before is obviously lost on them. As a splinter group of other organisations with Marxist overtones the true nature of their protest is obvious.\\n'The police must use the powers available to them to clear this protest immediately and the courts should use their powers to grant compensation to the public and businesses affected, taking protestors to bankruptcy as necessary.'\\nMP Andrew Bridgen slammed the 'extremely irresponsible' demonstrators, saying: 'They are putting people's livelihoods and indeed lives at risk through their reckless behaviour. They don't actually care about what's good for the general public and they are little more than anarchists.'\\nJames Gray added: 'It's a scandal and bad manners. I have long struggled for people's rights to protest peacefully, but they must not deny the freedoms of other people. If activists stop people on the M25 from getting into work or prevent journalists from going to their offices, then they are disrupting the nation. That is wrong, and they should not be allowed to get away with that.'\\nProtesters held signs which said 'sorry for the disruption' as they clashed with drivers stuck in the queue. One motorist told LBC: 'They are working against themselves', while others screamed abuse telling the activists 'we'll lose our jobs'. One could be heard calling them 'f**king scumbags'.\\nInsulate Britain, which is demanding government action on home insulation, tweeted: '#InsulateBritain are back. @BorisJohnson can you hear us yet?'\\nIt took police two-and-a-half hours to clear the climate protesters from the five locations today as an eco-mob caused chaos by\u00a0holding up rush hour traffic on the M25, A3 and Dartford Crossing.\\nOne woman revealed how she was on the way to see her daughter, who had just gone into labour, when she was caught up in the protest.\\nLBC reporter Rachael Venables said the woman was stuck while on the way to pick up her grandchild and take her to the hospital.\\nAnother woman took to Twitter to express her frustration, writing: 'Thank you #InsulateBritain . Now I can't get to work to teach the young people you say you're protecting.'\\nAlso among those held up shortly after 8am was an NHS worker trying to get home after a night shift.\\nJay told LBC: 'I'm exhausted. I'm not happy with the situation.'\\nPharmacist Graham Weidle said: 'I need to open a pharmacy in Soho. We all support climate change, we all support sustainability and we all support a more regenerative way of life. But this doesn't help.'\\nOne motorist on Twitter said his nurse wife was trying to get her elderly mother to an urgent hospital appointment but was being held up by 'these muppets'.\\nAn angry cafe owner meanwhile turned down cash from members of the group after they had a whip round.\\nThe man claimed he had lost business because of Insulate Britain, prompting each protester to give him \u00a310.\\nHowever, the furious owner refused to take the cash, leading to a row just off the busy motorway.\\nHe said: 'You can't have a whip round for me. What about the other thousands of people that are on the motorway? You've destroyed all their businesses.'\\nAnother frustrated driver said: 'Can this protest on the M25 just not?? Both days we have travelled and are traveling and they do it both those days.'\\nWhile a male driver said: 'You know the people stuck on the M25 due to protests. I'm one of them. Have just had my most public 'toilet' ever, but took a standing ovation from the traffic jam and the rubber neckers!'\\n\\nHowever, president of motoring insurance group AA, Edmund King, said that during the last Insulate Britain blockade, a thermal insulation engineer was prevented from going to work after being stuck in the traffic queue.\\nOn Wednesday he said: 'Whilst most people understand the need to take action on climate change, these motorway blockade tactics are just backfiring as they are alienating the working public stuck in this chaos and subsequently pumping out more emissions.\\n'It is somewhat ironic that thermal insulation engineers trying to insulate Britain were stuck in the congestion caused by Insulate Britain. Essential deliveries, emergency services, people missing hospital and business appointments are all hit by these blockades. Hopefully the police will take immediate action to unblock the arteries of Britain.'\\nA Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: 'We are currently dealing with an incident near Junction 1 of the A1M southbound. Officers are at the scene. The road has been closed and as a result there is some traffic congestion. Motorists are asked to please avoid the area where possible.'\\nIn a statement, an Insulate Britain spokesman said: 'The world is burning and burning, each year worse than the last. They are disrupting not just today or this week but the next hundred thousand years - for ever.\\n'This country is facing the greatest crisis ever and we are told to plant trees and do the recycling. We can take the lies no longer. We are not stupid. We are not children. We will no longer tolerate this dishonesty. We demand credible action now.\\n'Proper jobs for hundreds of thousands of people to start the first real step - to insulate all the homes of this country - which pound for pound gives us the biggest reduction in carbon emissions.\\n'It is a total no-brainer and yet this Government refuses to get on with the job. This is criminal negligence.\\n'We have decided there is something more important than our fears. We have a quiet, iron determination now. We are here to do our duty - to fulfil our responsibilities to our grandparents and their parents who gave their lives to preserve our way of life. To our children and the next thousand generations who will curse us for eternity if we do not act.\\n'We will keep going until the Government responds.'\\nThe activist speaking to LBC's Nick Ferrari said:\u00a0'The United Nations have made it very very clear that humanity is in a code red, which means that emissions - global emissions - are rising. I do believe that insulating the housing stock of the UK is the most cost-effective way to reduce those emissions.\\n'History has shown that breaking the law peacefully and causing disruption - with Martin Luther King, the Suffragettes and Gandhi - that these are the most effective tactics to get change to happen quickly.'\\nThe failure of police to immediately arrest protesters who blocked five junctions of the M25 for up to four hours sparked fury this week.\\nYesterday Richard Madeley\u00a0accused the original M25 eco mob of 'fascism' for 'blocking out reality' in an angry clash with an activist - as motorists trying to haul away protesters were called 'heroes' amid anger at the slow police response.\\nElectrician\u00a0Liam Norton, 36, who did not take part in the protest but was one of the organisers, went head to head with the Good Morning Britain\u00a0host yesterday morning as he attempted to justify the disruptive roadblocks as a means of protecting the planet.\\nHe said: 'Why do you think grannies are on the road yesterday? Why do you think that's happening? This is the way that has been proven to force the Government to act... the Government is not looking after their citizens, Richard.'\\nEmail jack.wright@mailonline.co.uk\\nBut Mr Madeley rejected the argument, saying: 'You're blocking out reality, aren't you? You're only seeing one aspect of reality. You're ignoring the reality of the individual.\\n'You're seeing the reality of the state, and that's fine, but you're seeing it at the expense of the reality of the individual, and that's fascism, I'm afraid.'\\nA video has emerged of officers protecting the law-breaking activists while dragging away an irate and incredulous driver who decided to take the law into his own hands.\u00a0The unnamed motorist tried to pull activists off the sliproad, believed to be at junction three for Swanley, Kent, as another man repeatedly yells at a policeman: 'I just don't understand why you won't move them'.\\nThe driver trying to break-up the protest and tear down banners was then dragged away by officers who then returned to guarding the members of Insulate Britain.\\nA second video showed another motorist trying to clear protesters\u00a0at junction 20 of the M25 at Kings Langley in Hertfordshire, leading some people to call him a 'hero' - although others warned about the dangers of vigilantism.\\nThere was also disruption and long queues at junction six for Godstone in Surrey, 14 for London Heathrow Airport, 20 for\u00a0Kings Langley in Hertfordshire and 31 for Purfleet in Essex near the Dartford Crossing.\u00a0There have been 92 arrests so far.\\nSurrey Police arrested 35 activists for a range of offences including highway obstruction - but all have now been released. A total of 15 were released on conditional bail while the rest were released pending investigation.\\nNo one has yet been charged, with the force saying they are collecting witness testimonies and dashcam footage to 'progress the investigation'.\\nInsulate Britain confirmed that electrician Liam Norton was not among those arrested.\\nObstruction of a British road 'without lawful authority or excuse' is an offence under Section 137 of the Highways Act 1980, with a punishment of a\u00a0fine and up to six months in prison.\\nYet at Junction 14 of the M25, close to Heathrow, it took four hours to arrest the activists and reopen the road at one of the busiest stretches of motorway in the UK.\\nWith police again accused of being too scared of tackling climate change activists, one critic tweeted: 'Public servants stand by while the public do the job they are paid for.\\n'This bl**dy country at times is just beyond. They were happy to arrest people for going for a walk or stopping on a bench for a coffee'.\\nAnother wrote: 'If the police won't enforce the law then that leaves no choice but to do it ourselves.\\n'These climate change imbeciles have no legal basis upon which to block the highway especially as such nonsense could potentially hold up emergency services and cost lives'.\\nOfficers from Kent, Surrey, Essex, Hertfordshire and the Metropolitan Police dealt with the incidents that caused delays of up to four hours at rush hour.\\nMany questioned why it took up until Midday to break-up protests that began at 8am.\\nA former chief constable said the protest was 'extraordinarily dangerous', while motorists - some of whom were stuck in traffic for three hours with young children - said it was 'madness', with one urging police: 'Move them.'\\nThe Metropolitan Police said it took action 'to ensure disruption was minimised' while the Hertfordshire force insisted it 'quickly mobilised resources to the scene'.\\nAA president Edmund King said: 'This action is not only incredibly dangerous in potentially putting lives at risk, but it also backfires in environmental terms by causing more delays and more vehicle emissions.\\n'These are some of the busiest sections of the M25 where tens of thousands of drivers will have been affected and it has a negative knock-on effect on economic activity.'\\nA Surrey Police spokesman said: 'We were called to Junction 6 and Junction 14 of the motorway just after 8am following reports that a number of people were protesting on behalf of Insulate Britain.\\n'A total of 35 people were arrested on suspicion of various offences, including public nuisance, obstructing the highway and conspiracy to cause danger to road users.\\nThey were taken to custody, with 15 released on conditional bail while the rest have been released under investigation pending further enquiries.'\\nWhat the officer said:\\n'Right, I have spoken to officers about what offences are available to them. Individual officers will come and speak to you and they will make their own decision as to whether you are arrested for failing to comply with Section 14.\\n'Each individual officer will come and speak to you and if you've got any questions at all, just ask and if any of you are in any discomfort or need anything, just let me know and we'll try and sort you out in a nice way.\\n'Couldn't have phrased that any worse could I? But no, if you need any assistance at all, just let me know okay?\\n'Right, we'll be as we are.'\\nIn another video, a single police officer was filmed strolling onto the motorway as protesters sat with their hands glued to the road.\\nHe said: 'Anybody organising it? Who's the organiser here? No one?\\n'Okay, I'm going to have to ask you all to move as you are blocking the highway.\\n'Anybody want to admit to being part of this?\\n\\nIronically, Mr Hallam owns a farmhouse which was described as 'poorly insulated' in an official energy performance certificate.

'They will block roads. They will go on hunger strike.\\n'They will do all the things that have happened before in British history. If the Government doesn't take a lead, then there will be massive social unrest.'\\nMr Hallam set up his splinter group when he caused a rift within Extinction Rebellion over comments he made about the Holocaust.\\nHe told a German newspaper it 'was just another f***ery in human history' \u2013 but later said the remark was taken out of context from 'three seconds' of argument.\\nSources close to Mr Hallam, an organic farmer who lost his business because of severe weather, said he would 'keep escalating' his demonstrations to 'grab the headlines' from other activists.\\nLast week the group infuriated motorists by blocking the M25 on three separate days as part of a protest.\\nMembers of the group sat, and some even glued themselves to the road, causing huge delays for drivers\\nAs many as 80 activists from the Insulate Britain group brought the motorway to a half on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, while also shutting down the M3 and M11.\\nPolice chiefs came under intense pressure for the way they tackled the protests and Priti Patel summoned Met Commissioner Cressida Dick and other force bosses responsible for the M25 after they failed to drag away protesters 'immediately'.\\nShocking video emerged showing an officer stopping traffic to allow protesters onto the motorway earlier this week, with the Met saying he was trying to keep the activists 'safe'.\\nThe anger at the police's handling of the situation was increased after photos emerged showing some protesters attending all three demonstrations, despite being previously arrested.\\nNow, senior officers from Hertfordshire, Surrey, Kent, Essex and the Met are considering charging the activists with more serious crimes to ensure they are deterred from further protests.\\nConspiracy to cause public nuisance, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison, is thought to be one of the punishments considered.\\nOne police source told the Telegraph: 'The disruption involved massively outweighs the offence and the protesters are well aware of that. Most of those involved have been arrested on suspicion of blocking the highway, which is a relatively minor offence.\\n'Even if these cases reach the charging threshold for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and it goes to court, the sentences available on conviction are very small. As we saw with some of the Extinction Rebellion protesters, they walk away with conditional discharges, which ends up encouraging others to take similar action.'\\nIt comes after the Home Secretary held an emergency Zoom call with police chiefs after protesters from\u00a0Insulate Britain shut down the UK's busiest road during rush hour every 48 hours this week and made officers 'look like idiots', one Tory MP said.\\nThe enviro-zealots even warned officers they would do it again after being released without bail conditions on Monday and Wednesday - with Hertfordshire Police defending the decision not to charge them claiming they still need time to 'gather evidence and build a case' despite arresting dozens of them in the middle of the M25.\\nSurrey Police's Chief Constable Gavin Stephens, Kent Police's Chief Constable Alan Pughsley, Hertfordshire Constabulary's Chief Constable Charlie Hall and Essex's Ben-Julian Harrington are all in the firing line over their soft-touch response to the crippling protests.\\nA spokesman for the Association of British Drivers said: 'The police have failed to do their duty. It's time for Chief Constables to decide whose side they're on. The actions of these people is an absolute bl**dy disgrace.\\n'They should be locked away. I'm appalled about why they have been released on bail with no restrictions. Not only have police not arrested these people for proper offences - they've not charged them with anything at all'.\\nA source close to the Home Secretary told MailOnline that at a Friday summit with police chiefs she reiterated her message that 'these people are breaking the law and must be removed immediately'.\\nThe insider did not go into what was discussed about the M25 - and how they would break the cycle of protests -\u00a0 for 'operational reasons'. But said:\u00a0'The British public does not expect the police to be standing by while protesters disrupt people's daily lives.'\\nTory MP for South Thanet, Craig Mackinlay MP, said:\u00a0\u00a0'I am surprised that the Metropolitan Police Commissioner has not advised her officers to make use of one of numerous possible legal provisions to prevent, remove, arrest and charge the activists within Insulate Britain, Extinction Rebellion and other anarchist groups causing mayhem to the law-abiding public simply trying to go about their normal activities and costing millions in lost business and valuable police time.'\\nOne Tory backbencher told MailOnline: 'Priti's tough talking isn't enough. These protesters are making the police look like idiots and the buck stops with the Home Secretary and her chief constables'.\\nMs Patel is under growing pressure with some drivers taking to social media demanding she 'sorts this mess out' or resigns. Others said Boris Johnson should sack her if police continue to 'fail to keep roads open'.\\nPriti Patel had ordered police to take 'decisive action' against the 'selfish' eco-protesters and described the 'guerrilla tactics' of Insulate Britain as 'completely unacceptable'.", "image": [["Eco-warrior Liam Norton's south-west London home is single-glazed, has no cavity wall insulation and uses gas central heating, reports the Sun", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/19/13/48102807-10006191-image-m-32_1632055166062.jpg"], ["Mr Norton, an electrician, is one of the leading figures in Insulate Britain - an Extinction Rebellion off-shoot campaigning the Government to reduce home heating emissions to zero.
