The continued war in Ukraine also continues to have an impact.\\nIn March, average petrol and diesel prices surged more than any other month on record - 11p and 22p a litre respectively - meaning motorists have already endured the most costly Easter and early May Bank Holiday getaways on record.\\nIt is often at least a few weeks before retailers pass on wholesale increases because this is the

emissions, with around 60 per cent of them already producing oil and gas.\\nCampaigners say the other 40 per cent of projects that have not yet started must be stopped if the world is to avoid a climate catastrophe.\\nIf the expansion plans continue unabated, the analysis reveals, they will produce greenhouse gases equivalent to a decade of CO2 emissions from\u00a0China, the world's biggest polluter.\\nThe Paris Agreement, first signed in 2015, is an international agreement to control and limit climate change.\\nIt hopes to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2\u00b0C (3.6\u00b0F) 'and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F)'.\\nIt seems the more ambitious goal of restricting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F) may be more important than ever, according to previous research which claims 25 per cent of the world could see a significant increase in drier conditions.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Paris Agreement on Climate Change has four main goals with regards to reducing emissions:\\n1) \u00a0A long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\\n2) To aim to limit the increase to 1.5\u00b0C, since this would significantly cut risks and the impacts of climate change\\n3) Governments agreed on the need for global emissions to peak as soon as possible, recognising that this will take longer for developing countries\\n4) To undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with the best available science\\nSource: European Commission\\nUnder the global 2015 Paris climate treaty, countries pledged to curb temperature rises to 3.6\u00b0F (2\u00b0C) and pursue efforts to limit them to 2.7\u00b0F (1.5\u00b0C) above 19th century levels to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change.\\nFindings from the United Nations last year suggested the world needs to cut its production of coal, oil and gas by more than half in the coming decade to even have a chance of meeting the Paris Agreement's strict climate standards.\\nBut research shared with the Guardian\u00a0flies in the face of this, revealing that the dozen biggest oil companies are on track to spend $103m (\u00a384m) a day for the rest of the decade exploiting new fields of oil and gas.\\nHowever, these cannot be burned if global warming is to be limited to under 3.6\u00b0F (2\u00b0C).\\nData from the thinktank Carbon Tracker suggests that 27 per cent of the companies' projected investments are incompatible with this.\\nExxonMobil has the largest of these investment plans at $21 million (\u00a317 million) a day through to 2030, followed by Petrobras ($15m;\u00a312m), Chevron and ConocoPhillips (both $12m;\u00a39.8m), and Shell ($8m;\u00a36.5m).\\nWhen looking at the most dangerous investments \u2013 those that could help drive temperatures beyond 4.86\u00b0F (2.7\u00b0C) \u2013 Gazprom accounts for $17m (\u00a313.9m) a day of this, ExxonMobil $12m (\u00a39.8m), Shell $11m (\u00a39m) and PetroChina $9m (\u00a37.3m).\\nThe new research, which was led\u00a0by Kjell K\u00fchne from the University of Leeds, defines carbon bombs as 'projects capable of pumping at least 1 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions over their lifetimes'.\\nThe huge North Field gas fields in Qatar are named in the study as the biggest new oil and gas carbon bomb in the world.\\nResearchers also found that the US is\u00a0the leading source of potential emissions, with 22 carbon bombs that could emit 140 billion tonnes of CO2.\\nThese include conventional drilling and fracking from the waters of the Gulf of Mexico to the Permian Basin.\\nThe 140 billion tonnes of CO2 they could produce is\u00a0almost four times more than the entire world emits each year.\\nSaudi Arabia is the second biggest potential emitter after the US, followed by Russia, Qatar, Iraq, Canada, China and Brazil.\\nClimate campaigners Greenpeace\u00a0warned in response that 'while governments dither and discuss, fossil fuel companies are charging full speed ahead with \"carbon bomb\" projects, pushing us ever closer to an irreversible tipping point.'\\n'We need action now,' the group wrote on Twitter.\\nLast month\u00a0the UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said 'our addiction to fossil fuels is killing us'.\\nHe added that it was 'now or never' to start slashing emissions and blasted companies and governments whose climate actions did not match their words.\\n'Simply put, they are lying, and the results will be catastrophic,' Guterres said.\\n'Investing in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness.\\n'Climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals. But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels.'\\nIn August last year, following a\u00a0stark report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world's leading authority on climate science, Guterres called it 'a code red for humanity'.\\nThe report suggested that carbon emissions must fall by half by 2030 to preserve the chance of a liveable future, but said they show no sign of declining.\\nEarlier this week a Met Office study warned that there\u00a0is a 50-50 chance that temperatures will exceed the key 2.7\u00b0F (1.5\u00b0C) threshold for global warming in the next five years.\\nSuch a rise would be temporary, but researchers are still concerned about the way temperatures are heading.\\nThey said that one of the years between 2022 and 2026 is very likely to be the warmest on record globally, beating the current hottest year of 2016.\\nThe latest update, produced by the Met Office for the UN\u2019s World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), claimed that the chances of temporarily exceeding 2.7\u00b0F (1.5\u00b0C) above pre-industrial levels in one of the next five years have never been higher.\\nEmissions\\nCarbon dioxide\\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the biggest contributors to global warming. After the gas is released into the atmosphere it stays there, making it difficult for heat to escape - and warming up the planet in the process.\\nIt is primarily released from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, as well as cement production.\\nThe average monthly concentration of CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere, as of April 2019, is 413 parts per million (ppm). Before the Industrial Revolution, the concentration was just 280 ppm.\\nCO2 concentration has fluctuated over the last 800,000 years between 180 to 280ppm, but has been vastly accelerated by pollution caused by humans.\\nNitrogen dioxide\\nThe gas nitrogen dioxide (NO2) comes from burning fossil fuels, car exhaust emissions and the use of nitrogen-based fertilisers used in agriculture.\\nAlthough there is far less NO2 in the atmosphere than CO2, it is between 200 and 300 times more effective at trapping heat.\\nSulfur dioxide\\nSulfur dioxide (SO2) also primarily comes from fossil fuel burning, but can also be released from car exhausts.\\nSO2 can react with water, oxygen and other chemicals in the atmosphere to cause acid rain.\\nCarbon monoxide\\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is an indirect greenhouse gas as it reacts with\u00a0hydroxyl radicals, removing them. Hydroxyl radicals reduce the lifetime of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.\\nParticulates\\nWhat is particulate matter?\\nParticulate matter refers to tiny parts of solids or liquid materials in the air.\\nSome are visible, such as dust, whereas others cannot be seen by the naked eye.\\nMaterials such as metals, microplastics, soil and chemicals can be in particulate matter.\\nParticulate matter (or PM) is described in micrometres. The two main ones mentioned in reports and studies are PM10 (less than 10 micrometres) and PM2.5 (less than 2.5 micrometres).\\nScientists measure the rate of particulates in the air by cubic metre.\\nParticulate matter is sent into the air by a number of processes including burning fossil fuels, driving cars and steel making.\\nWhy are particulates dangerous?\\nParticulates are dangerous because those less than 10 micrometres in diameter can get deep into your lungs, or even pass into your bloodstream. Particulates are found in higher concentrations in urban areas, particularly along main roads.\\nHealth impact\\nWhat sort of health problems can pollution cause?\\nAccording to the World Health Organization, a third of deaths from stroke, lung cancer and heart disease can be linked to air pollution.\\nSome of the effects of air pollution on the body are not understood, but pollution may increase inflammation which narrows the arteries leading to heart attacks or strokes.\\nAs well as this, almost one in 10 lung cancer cases in the UK are caused by air pollution.\\nParticulates find their way into the lungs and get lodged there, causing inflammation and damage. As well as this, some chemicals in particulates that make their way into the body can cause cancer.\\nDeaths from pollution\\nAround seven million people die prematurely because of air pollution every year. Pollution can cause a number of issues including asthma attacks, strokes, various cancers and cardiovascular problems.\\nAsthma triggers\\nAir pollution can cause problems for asthma sufferers for a number of reasons. Pollutants in traffic fumes can irritate the airways, and particulates can get into your lungs and throat and make these areas inflamed.\\nProblems in pregnancy\\nWomen exposed to air pollution before getting pregnant are nearly 20 per cent more likely to have babies with birth defects, research suggested in January 2018.\\nLiving within 3.1 miles (5km) of a highly-polluted area one month before conceiving makes women more likely to give birth to babies with defects such as cleft palates or lips, a study by\u00a0University of Cincinnati found.\\nFor every 0.01mg/m3 increase in fine air particles, birth defects rise by 19 per cent, the research adds.\\nPrevious research suggests this causes birth defects as a result of women suffering inflammation and 'internal stress'.\\nWhat is being done to tackle air pollution?\\nParis agreement on climate change\\nThe Paris Agreement, which was first signed in 2015, is an international agreement to control and limit climate change.\\nIt hopes to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2\u00b0C (3.6\u00baF) 'and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F)'.\\nCarbon neutral by 2050\\nThe UK government has announced plans to make the country carbon neutral by 2050.\\nThey plan to do this by planting more trees and by installing 'carbon capture' technology at the source of the pollution.\\nSome critics are worried that this first option will be used by the government to export its carbon offsetting to other countries.\\nInternational carbon credits let nations\u00a0continue emitting carbon while paying for trees to be planted elsewhere, balancing out their emissions.\\nNo new petrol or diesel vehicles by 2040\\nIn 2017, the UK government announced the sale of new petrol and diesel cars would be banned by 2040.\\nHowever,\u00a0\u00a0MPs on the climate change committee have urged the government to bring the ban forward to 2030, as by then they will have an equivalent range and price.\\nNorway's electric car subsidies\\nThe speedy electrification of Norway's automotive fleet is attributed mainly to generous state subsidies.\u00a0Electric cars are almost entirely exempt from the heavy taxes imposed on petrol and diesel cars, which makes them competitively priced.\\nA VW Golf with a standard combustion engine costs nearly 334,000 kroner (34,500 euros, $38,600), while its electric cousin the e-Golf costs 326,000 kroner thanks to a lower tax quotient.\\nCriticisms of inaction on climate change\\nThe Committee on Climate Change (CCC) has said there is a 'shocking' lack of Government preparation for the risks to the country from climate change.\\nThe committee assessed 33 areas where the risks of climate change had to be addressed \u2013 from flood resilience of properties to impacts on farmland and supply chains \u2013 and found no real progress in any of them.\\nThe UK is not prepared for 2\u00b0C of warming, the level at which countries have pledged to curb temperature rises, let alone a 4\u00b0C rise, which is possible if greenhouse gases are not cut globally, the committee said.\\nIt added that cities need more green spaces to stop the urban 'heat island' effect, and to prevent floods by soaking up heavy rainfall.", "image": [["The world's biggest fossil fuel companies are planning almost 200 'carbon bomb' oil and gas projects that could doom efforts to limit planetary warming to 2.7\u00b0F (1.5\u00b0C), research shows", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/05/12/13/57730793-10809079-image-a-3_1652360222551.jpg"], ["An investigation found that these schemes (pictured by country) could potentially unleash some 646 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions, with around 60 per cent of them already producing oil and gas", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/05/12/13/57730797-10809079-image-a-4_1652360245319.jpg"], ["According to a separate report from the\u00a0Stockholm Environment Institute, most industrialised nations plan to increase oil and gas production, and a number are\u00a0continuing coal extraction", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/05/12/13/49420361-10809079-According_to_a_separate_report_from_the_Stockholm_Environment_In-a-2_1652360217830.jpg"], ["Air pollution comes from burning fossil fuels, cars, cement making and agriculture", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/07/11/16/15924344-7236653-image-a-1_1562858255999.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/07/11/16/14742896-7236653-Chris_Skidmore_the_acting_energy_minister_has_claimed_the_costs_-a-2_1562858502026.jpg"], ["The Paris Agreement, which was first signed in 2015, is an international agreement to control and limit climate change.

I make no excuses.'\\nAs New Zealand's most senior officer between 2014 and 2020, Mr Bush carried out sweeping reforms and transformed the force. Under his watch, crime fell by 20% and public satisfaction rose five points to 84%.\\nHowever, it is unclear whether the conviction almost 40 years ago could stop him from becoming the head of Britain's biggest police force.\\n\\nMatt Jukes -\u00a0Matt Jukes joined South Yorkshire police in 1995 three years after graduating with a degree in mathematics from Oxford.\\nHe worked as a detective and rose through the ranks to represent UK police forces at G8 meetings and lead on national anti-terror strategy.\\nMr Jukes is best known for tackling Rotherham grooming gangs while borough commander in the Yorkshire town from 2006 to 2010. He's currently serving as an Assistant Commissioner for Specialist Operations\\nSir Mark Rowley -\u00a0A familiar figure after leading the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism operations for four years.\\nAlthough he resigned from the police in 2018, Sir Mark is still only 58 and sources believe he could be tempted back by the biggest job in British policing.\\nServed as chief constable of Surrey for three years to 2011, when he joined the Met as an assistant commissioner.\\nLucy D'Orsi\u00a0- Previously served as deputy assistant commissioner at the Met before moving to lead the British Transport Police in 2020, where she has impressed colleagues.\\nIan Livingstone\u00a0- The non-nonsense head of Police Scotland for four years who impressed Boris Johnson with his effective policing operation at COP26 in Glasgow.\\nShaun Sawyer - The chief constable of Devon and Cornwall Police announced this weekend that he would stand down from his current role. He served in the Met for more than 20 years and is considered highly likely to apply.\\nPolice sources told The Times newspaper that a mistake made in youth might be difficult to forgive when Scotland Yard needs to adopt a zero-tolerance approach to any officer who breaches standards.\\nBoth the Home Office and City Hall have said that Dame Cressida's replacement would need to bring drastic improvements to the Met.\\nMr Bush told The Times that he expected to address the drink-driving conviction with the decision-making panel but declined to comment further.\\nA Home Office spokesperson said: 'The process to recruit a new Commissioner will conclude as quickly as possible, however the priority will be to select the very best person to lead the country's largest police force and make London an even safer place to live and work.\\n'We have launched the public advertisement and the selection process will follow fair and open principles.'\\nMailOnline has approached City Hall for comment.\\nMr Bush is one of six applicants whose credentials will be reviewed over the next two weeks before interviews.\\nHis rivals include Sir Mark Rowley, the former counterterrorism chief who also ran Surrey police, Shaun Sawyer, the chief constable of Devon and Cornwall, and Jon Boutcher, who is leading the inquiry into unsolved murders in Northern Ireland.\\nDame Cressida was ousted as Met Police Commissioner in February after confidence in the force collapsed in the wake of a slew of sexism, racism and misconduct scandals.\\nLast year, relations between the public and police deteriorated further after serving Met cop Wayne Couzens' brutal abduction, rape and murder of Sarah Everard during the Covid lockdown.\\nOn her final patrol in Essex, Dame Cressida directly accused the Mayor of London of forcing her out and confirmed the events at City Hall before and after her exit would be fully investigated.\\nSpeaking to journalists in Chingford she discussed the circumstances surrounding her departure and said: 'The Mayor of London is a democratically elected person. He has a job to do, he has certain responsibilities in relation to the Metropolitan Police Service.\\n'He caused me to say that I would step aside, I did not voluntarily resign. What happened in the run-up to that and subsequently in the last few weeks perhaps, I don't know, will be looked at by Sir Tom Winsor.'\\nDame Cressida did not apologise for any of the Met's failings, adding: 'We hear the criticism, know not everyone has confidence in us to provide a good service when they need us, and have seen among us those whose horrific actions have let you all, and us, down so terribly.\\n'Each one drives us to get better, to root out those who don't uphold our standards and don't deserve to wear our uniform. To improve our response so all our communities feel protected by us'.\\nTouching on the Met's culture and claims of sexism and racism, she said: 'The Met is far more diverse and inclusive than it has ever been. It is a wonderful place to work and we need women and men of all backgrounds to join us and continue to make a difference'.\\nDame Cressida previously apologised publicly following the conclusions into the cases involving Ms Henry, Ms Smallman and Ms Everard, said she was 'seething angry' about the racist, sexist and homophobic messages from officers at Charing Cross station and defended how the force dealt with partygate.\\nTwo inquiries are currently under way looking at the culture within the Met.\\nDame Cressida said the culture in the force 'has been changing' following the death of Ms Everard and the publication of the WhatsApp messages.\\nShe added: 'I believe during my commissionership you have seen a real opening up of the Met. We are much more transparent, we are much closer to our public, and we have been seeking to root out the people who have let London down or may let London down, those people who can't live up to the professional standards that London would expect of its police service.\\n'We've had some horrible things done in the last year by people who were wearing and shaming the uniform of the Metropolitan Police. (It was an) awful, awful event with Sarah Everard being killed, a terrible thing, unimaginably bad for everyone. Since then, some other things have shocked the Me. But we haven't stood by - we were already changing very fast.'\\nShe then listed work being undertaken by the force to improve it, such as investing in professionalism, updating its unit which deals with officers who commit domestic abuse and sexual offences and involving the public to 'help improve its professionalism'.\\nIn the end, it is a wonder she survived in the job so long.\\nOnly last year, her force was officially branded 'institutionally corrupt'. Incredibly, despite such a devastating finding, she did not resign.\\nInstead 'Teflon' Dame Cressida Dick has made a habit of trotting out humiliating apologies, for both recent and historical blunders, including admitting that the Sarah Everard debacle had brought 'shame' on the Metropolitan Police.\\nThe daughter of two Oxford academics, Dame Cressida, 61, joined the Metropolitan Police in 1983 after graduating from Oxford University with a degree in agriculture and forest sciences. Apart from a six-year spell at Thames Valley Police, she has spent her entire policing career at Scotland Yard.\\nHer first arrest, which came in her very first beat patrol in London's Soho in 1983, was of a man using a screwdriver to jemmy open the coin box in a telephone kiosk.\\nLater, at Bramshill Police College in 1995, she was the only woman out of ten officers chosen for fast-track promotion training, but she has been determined that her sex would not define her.\\nDame Cressida Dick will be succeeded as interim by Deputy Commissioner Sir Stephen House, who is expected to take over the Partygate probe into events in Westminster during lockdown.\\nSir Stephen, Police Scotland's former Chief Constable, had his own career mired in controversy after it was claimed he was effectively kicked out of the force after a botched investigation into a car crash saw a woman left inside her vehicle for three days before being found alive.\\nLamara Bell and John Yuill lay in their car for three days despite a member of the public calling Police Scotland's non-emergency line to report a damaged vehicle. Miss Bell was still alive when emergency services finally arrived, but later died in hospital.\\nPolice Scotland was eventually fined \u00a3100,000 for health and safety failures over the fatal crash last September.\\nHe stood down and retired in 2015 following the incident, but it was later claimed he was effectively sacked by Nicola Sturgeon over the incident, her former aide Noel Dolan wrote in a bombshell book last year.\\nSir Stephen has also faced\u00a0criticism from Lib Dem MP and former police officer Wendy Chamberlain, who told the Evening Standard\u00a0he was a 'completely unsuitable' candidate to lead the Met.\\n'After so many scandals, the Met desperately needs strong new leadership to rebuild public trust.\\n'Putting it in the hands of someone who left his own trail of scandals in Police Scotland is not the way to do that.'\\nThe police chief was one of the first female undergraduates at Oxford's Balliol College in 1979. She always played cricket, football and rowed with 'the boys', saying it never bothered her. Later on, Dame Cressida was given time out to study for a qualification in criminology at Cambridge.\\nAt the Metropolitan Police, she was given responsibility for Operation Trident \u2013 which investigated gun and gang crimes \u2013 counterterrorism, the 2012 London Olympics, and ended up as the country's principal hostage negotiator.\\nBut since rising from an impressive rookie cop in the 1980s to the very top of British policing at the country's largest force, Dame Cressida has been embroiled in at least seven career-defining disasters.\\nThe wonder is that the first of them didn't spell the end.\\nTube death blunder\\nIn July 2005, Dame Cressida was in charge of the operation which saw blameless electrician Jean Charles de Menezes shot dead on a Tube train at Stockwell station in south London after he was mistaken for a terrorist who was under surveillance.\\nIt almost finished her career, and she says she thinks about it 'very often'.\\nThe armed officers believed him to be a fugitive suicide bomber who had escaped after failed attacks in London two weeks after the carnage of the 7/7 bombings.\\nDame Cressida was the 'gold commander' on the botched operation, and immediate lethal force \u2013 a shot to the head \u2013 was supposedly required because any other action risked setting off the suicide jacket.\\nNo officer, including Dame Cressida, faced any charges, and no one was reprimanded.\\nThe Met was found guilty of breaching health and safety laws and putting the public at risk, and was fined \u00a3175,000 and ordered to pay \u00a3385,000 costs from taxpayer funds. The Met chief was personally exonerated, but the shame of it lingered.\\nOperation Midland\\nIn 2014, Dame Cressida sanctioned the creation of Operation Midland, a disastrous investigation into spurious VIP child sex abuse allegations that saw completely innocent men pursued by the force.\\nFive years later, when the embarrassing operation began seriously unravelling, she refused to allow an inquiry into the conduct of officers involved.\\nThis was despite former High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques revealing how officers had used false evidence to obtain a search warrant for the raids. Dame Cressida said that an inquiry would be 'completely improper'.\\nWhile some of her calamities pre-dated her stint as Commissioner, this one sat squarely within her reign. A report in 2020 found the Metropolitan Police was more interested in covering up mistakes than learning from them.\\nThe Hampshire home of the Queen's confidant, Lord Bramall \u2013 who was also former head of the Armed Forces \u2013 had been invaded by police with search warrants in the early hours on the basis of spurious allegations of abuse by paedophile Carl Beech, a palpable fantasist.\\nAfter the Daily Mail exposed him, Beech was jailed. Before he died, D-Day hero Lord Bramall told his son Nick that 'he had never been so mortally wounded, even in battle'.\\nFormer Tory MP Harvey Proctor, who received a substantial payout after his life was ruined by the disastrous paedophile inquiry, last night expressed his delight at Dame Cressida's downfall.\\nHe was among seven high-profile victims of the Met \u2013 including Baroness Lawrence, whose son Stephen's 1993 murder investigation was botched by racist officers \u2013 who last year came together in a Mail interview to accuse Dame Cressida of having 'presided over a culture of incompetence'.\\nXR protests\\nIn 2019, Dame Cressida's force was widely condemned for its 'light-touch' policing of Extinction Rebellion protests, which blocked several key areas of London.\\nUnder her watch, career eco-activists from XR and its off-shoot Insulate Britain were given free rein to cause mayhem.\\nAmbulances were stopped from getting through, while businesses and workers were forced to halt their activities.\\nA low point came when police were filmed asking road-blocking protesters if they needed anything \u2013 rather than just arresting them.\\nDaniel Morgan\\nPerhaps the most jaw-dropping condemnation of Dame Cressida came in June of last year when an official report described her force as 'institutionally corrupt'.\\nAnd far from blaming the fiasco on a predecessor, it concluded that she had personally placed 'hurdles' in the way of a search for the truth about the death of Daniel Morgan \u2013 a private investigator who was brutally murdered in a south London pub car park in 1987.\\nDame Cressida was accused of 'obfuscation' for thwarting the Morgan inquiry team's attempts to access sensitive documents, leading to delays that cost the taxpayer millions. The report by Baroness O'Loan found that Scotland Yard was 'institutionally corrupt'.\\nThe Met has never found Mr Morgan's murderer, but there were long-standing allegations of police corruption over the killing and the aftermath.\\nMr Morgan's brother Alastair also joined Baroness Lawrence, Harvey Proctor and Lord Bramall in a devastating and unprecedented joint interview with the Daily Mail.\\nThey all signed a letter to the PM demanding Dame Cressida's resignation. Instead she clung on.\\nSarah Everard\\nThe brutally horrific murder of Sarah Everard in March last year by serving Met firearms officer Wayne Couzens went from disastrous to worse for Dame Cressida. She faced a clamour to quit after he was exposed as the killer.\\nIt then emerged Couzens had not been vetted properly and Met officers had failed to investigate after he was reported flashing women days before the murder.\\nBut perhaps the worst moment for the Commissioner was her officers' heavy-handed policing of a vigil for the murdered woman at Clapham Common in South London.\\nPhotographs of protesting women being pinned down by arresting officers who cited Covid restrictions on gatherings were published around the world, sparking condemnation.\\nWhen Couzens was convicted, it was dubbed Scotland Yard's 'darkest day'. Dame Cressida stood outside the Old Bailey and humbly admitted the murder had corroded trust in the police and brought 'shame' on her force.\\nMurder photos\\nIn December last year, two Scotland Yard officers who took photos of the bodies of two murder victims were jailed.\\nThe sisters who died \u2013 Nicole Smallman, 27, and 46-year-old Bibaa Henry, were black and there were accusations of racism. 2021 was also the force's worst ever year for teenage killings, with 30 deaths.\\nCharing Cross\\nEarlier this month, details emerged of horrific messages exchanged by officers at Charing Cross police station, by an official watchdog report.\\nSome 14 officers were investigated as a result, with two found to have a case to answer for gross misconduct.\\nOne was sacked and another resigned before he would have been dismissed.

The climate journalist's wife also supports activist group Extinction Rebellion. It was reported ECU upheld complaints about two claims he made in a series.", "text": "Anyone who watched the BBC's Panorama programme on November 3 last year without previously having taken an interest in climate change probably found themselves terrified.\\nThat edition of the Beeb's flagship documentary series, called Wild Weather: Our World Under Threat, began with the corporation's climate editor, Justin Rowlatt, telling viewers: 'The world is getting warmer and our weather is getting ever more unpredictable and dangerous. The death toll is rising around the world and the forecast is that worse is to come.'\\nFootage of terrible floods, storms, droughts and fires rolled on \u2014 with the clear implication that this had all been caused by man-made climate change.\\n'It has been a year of extreme weather,' Rowlatt went on. 'We have been able to see the impact of climate change all around us.'\\nNow jump forward to last week, when it was reported that the BBC's Executive Complaints Unit (ECU) had upheld complaints about two claims made in the programme.\\nFirst, it wasn't true that the death toll from natural disasters is rising. In fact, the opposite is true.\\nAccording to ourworldindata.com, the number of deaths globally from natural disasters has tumbled each decade for the past century, apart from a small blip in the 2000s, from an average of 524,000 a year in the 1920s to just 45,000 in the 2010s \u2014 despite a booming global population.\\nThe ECU also ruled that Rowlatt's claim that southern Madagascar was 'on the brink of the world's first climate-induced famine' was incorrect, as other factors were involved.\\nAlthough the ECU didn't spell out these other factors, the UN has previously blamed last year's famine partly on Covid restrictions, which prevented seasonal agricultural labourers from working as usual.\\nBut this is not the first time BBC viewers have been misled by the Corporation's climate editor.\\nLast December, the ECU had to clarify a claim made by Rowlatt that Britain's offshore wind is 'now virtually subsidy-free'.\\nAs was clarified, such a claim may be true of recently installed turbines, but many older models were built under contracts which guarantee them subsidies for many years to come.\\nSome at the BBC, it seems, are losing patience with their climate editor. 'The Justin Rowlatt stuff is grim,' an unnamed BBC source told one newspaper this week. 'These are not 'mistakes'; he's a campaigner.'\\nClimate campaigning certainly runs in his family. His wife, Bee, herself a former producer for the BBC World Service, has boasted on Twitter of joining Extinction Rebellion protests.\\n'Best thing about #BlackFriday,' she tweeted in 2018, 'is Extinction Rebellion bringing Oxford [Street] to a halt.'\\nShe has also supported a 'justice' fund which gives protesters access to legal advice.\\nRowlatt's sister Cordelia was fined for taking part in one of Insulate Britain's dangerous protests on the M25 last year.\\nBut what about Rowlatt himself? As a BBC journalist, he is supposed to maintain scrupulous impartiality at all times. Look through his output, however, and it is hard to argue that he is even trying.\\nTwo days before his Panorama programme in November, Rowlatt shocked viewers with a hysterical interview with Boris Johnson at the COP26 summit in Glasgow. He accused the Prime Minister of looking 'a little bit weaselly'.\\n'[You are] not ruling out opening a coal mine in Britain, a new coal mine in Britain!?' he breathlessly exclaimed. 'We started the Industrial Revolution \u2014 we should close the mines!'\\nAt no point did he seek to explore the complexities of the issue. Nor, by constantly interrupting, did he give the PM a chance to respond.\\nIn fact, the proposed mine in Cumbria to which he was referring would not produce coal for burning in power stations, but mainly coking coal for the steel industry, which as yet cannot produce steel commercially without it.\\nRowlatt's Twitter feed is also revealing. In March, he retweeted an activist who asserted: 'The stable climate structure of the past is breaking down. Time for everyone to start to grow food and learn what's ahead.'\\nRowlatt has tweeted, too, about the doomsday film Don't Look Up \u2014 in which a U.S. president dismisses warnings of a meteorite heading for Earth \u2014 describing it as 'a superb parody of our approach to [climate] change'.\\nElsewhere, when hard evidence counters Rowlatt's alarmist views, he doesn't want to know.\\nIn January, a study by the Office for National Statistics found that from 2001 to 2020 there was an average decrease of 27,755 climate-related deaths a year, with a small rise in heat-related deaths offset by a far larger fall in cold-related deaths due to milder winters.\\nRowlatt provided an 'analysis' of the study on the BBC's website, in which he suddenly discovered a scepticism he rarely shows over claims on the climate. Questioning the study, he wrote: 'Statistics can be slippery.'\\nBut is Rowlatt the problem? Or is there a wider issue at the BBC?\\nThere was a time when the Beeb was committed to presenting both side of the argument.\\nBut that seemed to stop abruptly in 2018, following a ruling by broadcast regulator Ofcom that the BBC's flagship radio programme, Today, had failed properly to challenge former Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Lawson over his criticisms of claims made by U.S. presidential candidate Al Gore, who made the Oscar-winning documentary about climate change, An Inconvenient Truth.\\nThe BBC's then director of news and current affairs, Fran Unsworth, sent staff a memo demanding that interviewees who were sceptical about man-made climate change were no longer to be invited regularly.\\n'To achieve impartiality, you do not need to include outright deniers of climate change in BBC coverage, in the same way as you would not have someone denying that Manchester United won 2-0 last Saturday. The referee has spoken,' the memo blasted.\\nLast September, Insulate Britain activist Zoe Cohen told the BBC that climate change would lead to 'the loss of all we cherish, our society, our way of life, law and order', and that 'our economy and our life is under threat'.\\nIt was a hysterical claim that has no foundation in science, yet she remained unchallenged on her data. Unsworth's instructions had clearly become the status quo.\\nAs for the two erroneous claims made in Rowlatt's Panorama programme, there were more that could have been picked apart.\\nAfter showing footage of last year's floods in Germany and China, for instance, Rowlatt asserted that 'these floods were not freak events. They are happening because global warming is throwing our weather patterns out of balance'.\\nYet a report by the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC) last August recorded that while rainfall over land is generally increasing, this hasn't translated into a higher risk of flooding except in a few rivers.\\nBetween 1961 and 2005, the maximum annual flow level increased in only 7 per cent of the world's rivers, while there was a decrease in almost 12 per cent.\\nOn droughts, the IPCC report stated that there is no observable upward trend in their frequency and severity globally, apart from in a few regions of Africa and South America.\\nOn tropical storms, there has been no increase in the number of hurricanes striking the U.S. Along parts of the Australian coastline, cyclone activity is at the lowest level it has been in at least the last 500 years.\\nAnd on extreme winds, it showed they were becoming less severe in mid to low latitudes, and only in latitudes above 60 degrees (which is where the Shetlands lie) are damaging winds becoming more common.\\nNot that you would guess any of this from watching Justin Rowlatt's programming.\\nOf course climate change is a problem, but there is evidence to suggest it is not the apocalypse that Rowlatt and some of his BBC colleagues want us to believe.\\nAnd while this week's revelations over Rowlatt's impartiality are something of a scandal for our national broadcaster, perhaps more disgraceful are the paid-up executives who have enabled their climate editor to present us with such a warped view of their 'truth'.", "image": [["An edition of Wild Weather: Our World Under Threat, began with Justin Rowlatt (pictured), telling viewers: 'The world is getting warmer and our weather is getting ever more unpredictable and dangerous'", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/05/15/22/57846891-0-image-m-47_1652650644042.jpg"], ["Footage of terrible floods, storms, droughts and fires rolled on \u00bf with the clear implication that this had all been caused by man-made climate change", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/05/15/22/57846897-0-image-a-43_1652650580062.jpg"], ["It was last week reported that the BBC's Executive Complaints Unit (ECU) had upheld complaints about two claims made in the programme", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/05/15/22/57846899-0-image-a-45_1652650590193.jpg"], ["Rowlatt's sister Cordelia (pictured) was fined for taking part in one of Insulate Britain's dangerous protests on the M25 last year", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/05/15/22/57846889-0-image-a-44_1652650586917.jpg"], ["The BBC's then director of news and current affairs, Fran Unsworth (pictured in 2015), sent staff a memo demanding that interviewees who were sceptical about man-made climate change were no longer to be invited regularly", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/05/15/22/57846911-0-The_BBC_s_then_director_of_news_and_current_affairs_Fran_Unswort-m-48_1652650872052.jpg"]], "author": ["Ross Clark for the Daily Mail"], "date": "2022-05-15"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-10834027/I-hate-showering-rarely-comb-hair-forget-brush-teeth.html": {"title": "Why I'm proud to be a 'gross girl': Writer, 35, admits she rarely showers because she 'doesn't like the feel of being wet and cold', skips deodorant, and 'forgets' to brush her teeth because it makes her food taste minty", "subtitle": "Annabel Fenwick Elliott, 35, lives alone in the Essex countryside with a dog.

Annabel tells FEMAIL why cleanliness is 'at the very bottom of her priority list' after racking up more than half a million views on TikTok.\\nYou might assume, given I'm not a fan of soap, hardly ever comb my hair, often forget to brush my teeth every day and sometimes don't shower for a week, that I'm one of a few things \u2013 homeless, an addict or mentally unhinged.\\nI am none of these things, but eschew regular washing out of choice. Surely I must be a raging hippy then? Wrong again. I don't believe in homoeopathy, star signs or the doctrine of Extinction Rebellion. Nor do I like slumming it. I don't even enjoy camping.\\nRather, I work from home and live alone in the depths of the Essex countryside with a dog who doesn't care if I potter around looking like I've been dragged through a hedge backwards.\\nAnd yes, frankly, I'm lazy. The only time I use deodorant is if I'm going to Tesco. My own cleanliness is at the very bottom of my priority list.\\nAnd it seems I'm not alone. Last weekend I started a TikTok account, which is, granted, profoundly uncool of me at the age of 35.\\nIt was mainly an exercise in getting more comfortable on camera, which I have to improve upon, being a journalist who sometimes does live commentary.\\nI didn't expect anyone to watch my banal mutterings \u2013 certainly no one I knew.\\nAhead of my first post on Saturday, I did consider whether perhaps I should put some make-up on for the first time in lord knows how long, or at least brush my hair, but ultimately decided against it.\\nAs we've already established, I'm lazy. And so, in lieu of anything interesting to say, I did what most of the yoof on TikTok seem to do \u2013 ramble on about the first thing that came to mind \u2013 which on that morning was to account for my scruffiness.\\nTo my astonishment, in less than a week, I've had more than half a million views on the videos in which I document my 'gross girl' antics, and even more surprisingly, the vast majority of comments have been in support of it. Which suggests I'm not quite so abnormal as I've always thought.\\nIn them, I have confessed that I live on my own, rarely interact with other humans and thus don't bother showering.\\nI don't particularly like the feeling \u2013 especially not in winter \u2013 of getting wet, and being cold, and then getting dry and putting on a different variation of the same costume I always wear; leggings and a soft T-shirt; matching pyjamas if I'm feeling particularly bouji. Not showering every day means not changing every day, which is fine by me.\\nI don't brush my hair, but instead just bung it in a bun atop my head when it starts getting too tangled.\\nI don't use deodorant or antiperspirant \u2013 what exactly is the point, unless I happen to be seeing someone? I do, as a compromise, keep a can of Febreze downstairs, just in case the postman comes and I have to sign for a package, which is seldom.\\nPerhaps I've fallen victim, subconsciously, to the rumours that plying our skin with all these chemicals several times a day isn't good for us, and can even be bad. 'Some people have wondered if aluminium in some deodorants and sprays affects cancer risk,' states Cancer Research UK. 'But there is no good evidence to suggest a link.'\\nStill, it feels unnecessary to me on an instinctual level, to block one's sweat glands on a daily basis for no good reason. We're the only species to be so slavish about scrubbing ourselves of our natural scent \u2013 indeed, vets tell us not to bathe our pets regularly, for it upsets the balance of their skin and interferes with the natural oils that condition their coats.\\nAnd we haven't always been so obsessed with soaping our bodies once, often twice a day. For most of human history, baths were a laborious task reserved solely for the very wealthy, and showering was only popularised in the mid-19th century.\\nWhich is not to say we should all be behaving like dogs or mediaeval peasants, just that our contemporary self-cleaning compulsion is probably more to do with vanity and good advertising campaigns than being a biological necessity. We are not living longer and getting sick less because of Dove bodywash and Sure deodorant, but rather clean drinking water and modern medicine.\\nI am less proud of the fact that I hardly ever brush my teeth the recommended twice or three times a day, which is obviously not smart. I don't like doing it first thing in the morning, which is when I eat, because it makes everything taste weird. You shouldn't brush them immediately afterwards because that only circulates the food into the crevices \u2013 a dentist told me that. And usually by the time I remember that I've forgotten to do it, it's time for another meal. Once a day it is then, at best.\\nI should point out that I'm not so slovenly as to inflict this behaviour on others. When I lived in London and worked in an office, I showered most weekdays, slapped on tinted moisturiser and at least used dry shampoo. When my fiance, who currently works abroad, is home, I brush my teeth twice a day and tolerate my cornflakes tasting like Colgate.\\nBut as soon as he's gone, and I'm back to being a hermit, all bets are off. My hairbrush gathers dust, my shower gets lonely, and my washing machine wonders what it's done to offend me.\\nThe welcoming response I've had to this on TikTok is either just a result of the algorithm matching me with other people as disgraceful as I am; or is proof that, since the recent pandemic rendered most of us antisocial and housebound by law, many have to come to realise just how freeing it is to ditch the endless preening.", "image": [["Annabel Fenwick Elliott, 35, (pictured), who lives in Essex, has gone viral on TikTok after revealing she doesn't prioritize her own cleanliness", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/05/19/16/58027255-10834027-Annabel_Fenwick_Elliott_35_pictured_who_lives_in_Essex_has_gone_-a-182_1652975703271.jpg"], ["Annabel said she didn't expect anyone to watch her mutterings and only joined TikTok to get more comfortable on camera", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/05/19/16/58027269-10834027-image-a-165_1652973759699.jpg"], ["Annabel said she doesn't 'particularly like the feeling' of having a shower and rarely bothers because she doesn't interact with other people often", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/05/20/11/58027271-10834027-Annabel_said_she_doesn_t_particularly_like_the_feeling_of_having-a-14_1653044189941.jpg"], ["Pictured: A 'rare photo' of Annabel with clean hair and makeup", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/05/19/16/58027263-10834027-Pictured_A_rare_photo_of_Annabel_with_clean_hair_and_makeup-a-183_1652975712790.jpg"], ["Annabel (pictured, with fianc\u00e9 Julius) revealed she isn't a fan of soap, doesn't brush her hair and forgets to brush her teeth when she is home alone", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/05/19/16/58027265-10834027-Annabel_pictured_with_fianc_Julius_revealed_she_isn_t_a_fan_of_s-a-185_1652975717113.jpg"], ["Annabel said humans are the only species to be 'so slavish about scrubbing' ourselves of our natural scent", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/05/19/16/58027247-10834027-Annabel_said_humans_are_the_only_species_to_be_so_slavish_about_-a-186_1652975718988.jpg"], ["Annabel argues we aren't living longer because of body wash and deodorant, but rather clean drinking water and modern medicine", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/05/19/16/58027249-10834027-Annabel_argues_we_aren_t_living_longer_because_of_body_wash_and_-a-187_1652975721301.jpg"], ["Annabel claims she would shower most weekdays and at least use dry shampoo when she lived in London and worked in an office.

Others used loudspeakers to broadcast voice recordings of people from South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria, the DRC and Uganda explaining how oil projects are destroying rather than benefiting their communities.'\\nMeanwhile, Cathy Allen from Extinction Rebellion Global Support, said: 'Africa has contributed just 2% to global emissions to date, while almost half the continent cannot access electricity.\\n'Yet the impacts of climate change throughout the continent are already brutal. How can we stand by and watch these money games in Mayfair?'\\nSpeaking at the scene, one protester, dressed in a suit and doing a piece to camera, said: 'We are not seeing any kind of development (in Africa). That's the line they are going to be spinning.\\n'As has been going on in Africa for literally hundreds of years now, this is conscious underdevelopment of Africa. And it is absolutely terrible.\\n'We are trying to send a really clear message that our generation, the people coming up now, we don't believe a country has to grow forever. That is completely insane. That is greed.\\n'A conference like this should not be taking place. If it is it should all be about justice for Africa.'\\nOrganisers behind the event, along with Radisson, who operate the May Fair hotel, have been contact for a comment.\\nIt comes as the eco-group vowed to send 'millions of people onto the streets' in defiance of a new Government crackdown on\u00a0disruptive 'guerrilla protests'.\\nThe climate change protest group said it is 'foolish' for ministers to think announcing new 'curbs' will stop people 'taking to the streets to demand their Government act to ensure a safe future for people in the UK and around the world', as it set out its intention for action from September 10.\\nIt comes after the Public Order Bill was unveiled as part of the Queen's Speech, with harsher sentences and new criminal offences for those involved in some types of protest.\\nThe Bill seeks to outlaw tactics in England and Wales such as protesters 'locking on' to public transport infrastructure or gluing themselves to roads, which have been adopted by campaign groups such as Insulate Britain.\\nIt will carry a maximum penalty of six months and an unlimited fine. Stop and search powers will allow police to detain campaigners carrying bike locks and other equipment designed to make themselves difficult to remove.\\nA new offence will also be introduced to specifically ban the obstruction of key national infrastructure such as airports, railways and newspaper printing presses, which will be punishable by up to 12 months in prison and an unlimited fine.\\nThe move represents a bid to revive measures which were previously put forward under the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill but had to be scrapped after being knocked back by the House of Lords.\\nIn a sign of the Government's determination to drive through the measures, officials said the legislation is set to be introduced in Parliament on Wednesday.\\nPolice will be given powers to stop eco 'hooligans' blocking roads and inflicting misery on motorists, under plans announced yesterday.\\nA Public Order Bill to tackle disruptive action by groups such as Extinction Rebellion was unveiled in the Queen's Speech.\\nThe Government had attempted to bring in the measures in January, but they were blocked by Labour and others in the House of Lords\\nA criminal offence of 'locking on' will be created to prevent activists chaining themselves to buildings, vehicles and other protesters.\\nIt will carry a maximum penalty of six months and an unlimited fine.\\nStop and search powers will allow police to detain campaigners carrying bike locks and other equipment designed to make themselves difficult to remove.\\nA new offence will also be introduced to specifically ban the obstruction of key national infrastructure such as airports, railways and newspaper printing presses, which will be punishable by up to 12 months in prison and an unlimited fine.\\nCharlie Waterhouse, from XR, said: 'It is foolish to think that announcing new curbs in the Queen's Speech will stop people taking to the streets to demand their Government act to ensure a safe future for people in the UK and around the world.\\n'As we in Extinction Rebellion know full well: what we do works. It's worked countless times before. It has worked to give us weekends and the vote, human rights and freedom. And it will work again.\\n'To be a bystander is not enough...\\n'So Boris Johnson and Priti Patel, we thank you. Our organisations were set up to break the law to drive positive change. Your actions show that we are winning.'\\nThe Bill will create new criminal offences of 'locking on' and going equipped to 'lock on' to other people, objects or buildings in order to cause 'serious disruption', with a maximum penalty of up to six months' imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both.\\nA new offence of interfering with key national infrastructure - such as airports, railways and printing presses - will carry a maximum sentence of 12 months in prison, an unlimited fine, or both.\\nIt will also become illegal to obstruct major transport works, such as the HS2 high-speed rail link, again punishable by up to six months in prison, an unlimited fine, or both.\\nThe Bill will also extend stop-and-search powers so the police can seize articles related to the new offences, while new serious disruption prevention orders will be available for those who repeatedly cause criminal disruption.\\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said ministers are determined to prevent protesters bringing the country to 'a grinding halt', adding: 'The law-abiding, responsible majority have had enough of anti-social, disruptive protests carried out by a self-indulgent minority who seem to revel in causing mayhem and misery for the rest of us.'\\nMs Patel denied she is attempting to erode the right to protest, describing it as a 'fundamental right... that we all cherish dearly' and dismissing such claims put forward by opponents as a 'lazy excuse'.", "image": [["Eco-activists have entered a swanky five-star Mayfair hotel as part of an anti-oil protest", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/05/17/10/57910861-10824189-Eco_activists_have_entered_a_swanky_five_star_Mayfair_hotel_as_p-a-16_1652779059120.jpg"], ["The group have also unfurled a banner with 'End Oil Colonialism' across of the front of the May Fair Hotel on Stratton Street", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/05/17/10/57910863-10824189-The_group_have_also_unfurled_a_banner_with_End_Oil_Colonialism_a-a-17_1652779059121.jpg"], ["According to the event's website, the summit aims to 'bring together Africa\u2019s upstream industry for a unique event shaped for companies active in Africa\u2019s oil and energy game'", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/05/17/10/57910859-10824189-According_to_the_event_s_website_the_summit_aims_to_bring_togeth-a-18_1652779059127.jpg"], ["Video shows protesters lying down inside the building shouting the phrase, while others hold banners outside with the words 'Justice for Africa'", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/05/17/10/57913535-10824189-Video_shows_protesters_lying_down_inside_the_building_shouting_t-m-29_1652781394393.jpg"], ["Two members of the group were seen lying down inside the hotel in central London beside a suitcase saying 'Just for Africa'", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/05/17/12/57917979-10824189-image-a-69_1652786849642.jpg"], ["Protesters managed to get on to a balcony next to the hotel and stayed up there with a banner with the words 'The Planet Can't Breathe'", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/05/17/12/57917969-10824189-image-a-66_1652786770092.jpg"], ["Extinction Rebellion protesters demonstrating at the May Fair Hotel in London today.

It is the only regular occasion when the three constituent parts of Parliament \u2013 the Sovereign, the House of Lords and the House of Commons \u2013 meet.\\nWhen is State Opening?\\nToday, Parliament was opened by the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge as Counsellors of State.\\nState Opening happens on the first day of a new parliamentary session or shortly after a general election.\\nThe last State Opening of Parliament took place on Tuesday 11 May 2021, at the start of the 2021-22 parliamentary session. The State Opening of Parliament following the 2019 general election took place on Thursday 19 December 2019.\\nWhat happens during the State Opening?\\nState Opening is the main ceremonial event of the parliamentary calendar, normally attracting large crowds and a significant television and online audience.\\nDue to the Covid-19 pandemic, however, the State Opening of 11 May 2021 was adapted, with reduced ceremonial elements and attendees to ensure it was COVID-secure.\\nUsually, the event would begin with the Queen's procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster, escorted by the Household Cavalry.\\nThe Queen arrives at Sovereign's Entrance and proceeds to the Robing Room. Wearing the Imperial State Crown and the Robe of State, she leads the Royal Procession through the Royal Gallery, packed with 600 guests, to the chamber of the House of Lords.\\nWho is Black Rod? What do they do and why?\\nThe House of Lords official known as Black Rod is sent to summon the Commons. The doors to the Commons chamber are shut in his or her face: a practice dating back to the Civil War, symbolising the Commons' independence from the monarchy. Black Rod strikes the door three times before it is opened. Members of the House of Commons then follow Black Rod and the Commons Speaker to the Lords chamber, standing at the opposite end to the Throne, known as the Bar of the House, to listen to the speech. He knocks three times with his Black Rod, from which he derives his name, and is finally admitted.\\nThe Queen's Speech is delivered to the throne by the Lord Chancellor in a special silk bag.\\n\\n\\nThe Queen's Speech\\nThe Queen's Speech is delivered by the Queen from the Throne in the House of Lords. Although the Queen reads the Speech, it is written by the government. It contains an outline of its policies and proposed legislation for the new parliamentary session.\\nAfter the Queen's Speech\\nWhen the Queen leaves, a new parliamentary session starts and Parliament gets back to work. Members of both Houses debate the content of the speech and agree an 'Address in Reply to Her Majesty's Gracious Speech'. Each House continues the debate over the planned legislative programme for several days, looking at different subject areas. The Queen's Speech is voted on by the Commons, but rarely in the Lords.\\nHistory of State Opening\\nTraditions surrounding State Opening and the delivery of a speech by the monarch can be traced back as far as the 16th century. The current ceremony dates from the opening of the rebuilt Palace of Westminster in 1852 after the fire of 1834.\\n\\n\\nBoris Johnson could be heard asking 'are we adjourned?' as MPs returned to the House of Commons after the Queen's Speech.\\nThe Prime Minister exited the chamber immediately and could be heard mentioning lunch, while other MPs spent time mingling in the Commons.\\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said afterwards that the Queen's Speech 'does nothing to help the millions of families and pensioners facing soaring bills and eye watering inflation'.\\n'The Conservatives have failed to deliver a cut to VAT that would have saved families an average of \u00a3600, failed to help pensioners and failed to help the most vulnerable in our society,' he said.\\n'The Conservatives are continuing to neglect rural communities. There was nothing in these plans to support farmers on the brink, to tackle soaring ambulance waiting times and GP shortages, or to stop the dumping of filthy sewage into our river and seas.\\n'It shows a Prime Minister refusing to listen to the clear message sent by voters at last week's local elections who are fed up of being taken for granted by this Conservative Government.'\\n\\nThe Confederation of British Industry said the Government had to remain 'laser-focused' on unlocking investment needed to secure economic growth.\\nMatthew Fell, CBI chief UK policy director, said: 'The Queen's Speech comes at a crucial time, with households and businesses facing significant economic headwinds.\\n'Firms looking for the Government to address the cost-of-living crisis by growing the economy will be encouraged by the ambition in the Queen's Speech.\\n'The focus on infrastructure, energy security and skills all lay the foundations for sustainable, longer-term growth. Reaching for smarter, better regulation will ensure the UK remains world-leading in finance and put us at the front of the pack to make the most of emerging technologies.\\n'But alongside ambition, what's needed now is a relentless focus on delivery.\\n'Ahead of the autumn budget, the Government should remain laser-focused on unlocking the investment needed to grow the economy and address the cost-of-living crisis.'\\nBefore the heir to the throne's arrival at Parliament, the Yeomen of the Guard, the royal bodyguards, carried out their ceremonial search of the cellars of the Palace of Westminster for explosives - a tradition dating back to Guy Fawkes's gunpowder plot of 1605 where English Catholics failed to blow up the Protestant King James I and Parliament.\\nThe Sovereign's Throne in the House of Lords was left symbolically empty, with the monarch watching proceedings on television at Windsor where she continues her desk duties. Questions will inevitably be asked about whether the increasingly frail 96-year-old monarch will ever be seen in the Palace of Westminster again, as she reduces her public events.\\nHer Majesty was said to be determined to be at the Houses of Parliament this morning but has been forced to miss it\u00a0because she is struggling to walk or stand for long periods. The monarch appears to be prioritising the\u00a0Platinum Jubilee next month.\\nFor Prince Charles, today is the biggest day of his royal life today as his mother focuses on being well enough to attend events to mark her 70 years on the throne in early June. The heir to the throne has taken on more and more of the Queen's responsibilities, but this is the most important state occasion he has absorbed so far.\\nThe Queen obeyed doctor's orders to miss the State Opening of Parliament for the first time in 59 years as she prioritises the Platinum Jubilee next month.\\nHer Majesty was said to be determined to be at the Houses of Parliament this morning but\u00a0will skip the Queen's Speech\u00a0because she is struggling to walk or stand for long periods.\\nShe was forced to pull out after speaking to her medical team about her 'episodic mobility problems', Buckingham Palace said night, despite a\u00a0'wheelchair-friendly route' being discussed so she could make it.\\nThe monarch is expected to limit her appearances at the Platinum Jubilee to the Trooping the Colour - the parade and flypast that kicks off the celebrations on Thursday June 2 - and a service of celebration at St Paul's Cathedral the next day, which will be attended by the entire Royal Family including Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, who have been banned from the Buckingham Palace balcony 24 hours earlier. But her presence is unlikely to be confirmed until the day itself.\\n\\nTech giants such as Google and Facebook face being required to pay newspapers and other media outlets for using their stories, under a new laws proposed by the Government.\\nThe Queen's Speech contains a Draft Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Bill.\\nIt outlines plans to make sure powerful social media platforms\u00a0 treat businesses that use them professionally 'are treated fairly and can succeed without having to comply with unfair terms'\\nUnder the plans, which are modelled on a system that has been introduced in Australia, the platforms will be encouraged to negotiate payment deals with news organisations. If the negotiations fail, an independent arbitrator would set a fair price.\\nThe move, being driven by Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries, comes amid growing concerns that the tech companies are dominating online advertising, to the detriment of consumers and businesses.\\nUnder the new law, the Digital Markets Unit (DMU) created last year in the\u00a0Competition and Markets Authority would be able to target a small group of 'very powerful' digital firms 'such as social media and online search'.\\nThese would then be subject to 'legally enforceable rules and obligations to ensure they cannot abuse their dominant positions at the expense of consumers and other businesses'.\\nThe DMU will also get powers to 'proactively address the root causes of competition issues in digital markets'.\\nBlack Rod is the senior official responsible for maintaining order at the House of Lords.\\nThe official's most famous task is banging on the door of the House of Commons with a ceremonial staff during the annual State Opening of Parliament to summon MPs to hear the Queen's Speech.\\nTo symbolise the primacy of the Commons, the door is slammed in Black Rod's face, and the holder of the office is required to bang three times before the door is opened.\\nBlack Rod acts as secretary to the Lord Great Chamberlain, with responsibility for major ceremonial events in the Palace of Westminster.\\nThe position is appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of a selection panel chaired by the Lord Speaker.\\nSince 2018, the post has been held by Sarah Clarke, who was the first woman to take on the 670-year-old role.\\nHer official title is Lady Usher of the Black Rod.\\nShe replaced David Leakey, who had served since 2011.\\nThe Queen left it until the 11th hour to see if she would be well enough to attend. The 96-year-old takes her constitutional duties extremely seriously, and it is only the third time she has missed it in her 70-year reign. The last time she stayed away was\u00a059 years ago when she was pregnant with Prince Edward.\\nThe State Opening of Parliament is one of the monarch's most significant public duties and involves the reading of the Queen's Speech, outlining her government's policies and proposed legislation for the new parliamentary session.\\nUntil yesterday morning Buckingham Palace had repeatedly said the Queen still 'hoped' to attend. She has only missed the event twice in her entire reign \u2013 in 1959 and 1963 when she was pregnant with Prince Andrew and Prince Edward respectively \u2013 and the speech was read by the then Lord Chancellor.\\nThere was no doubt that the high-profile event would have been physically gruelling for her, despite steps being taken to minimise her need to walk.\\nEven though she has taken the lift into the building since 2016 and officials had discreetly discussed a private 'wheelchair-friendly route', the Queen would still have been required to walk into the chamber.\\nAfter consultations with her doctors yesterday the palace announced last night that she had 'reluctantly' taken the decision to pull out.\\nIt is understood she is continuing to experience what officials describe as the 'episodic mobility problems' that have dogged her since last year and forced her to cancel a string of high-profile public engagements.\\nHer spokesman said: 'The Queen continues to experience episodic mobility problems and in consultation with her doctors has reluctantly decided that she will not attend the State Opening of Parliament.\\n'At Her Majesty's request, and with the agreement of the relevant authorities, the Prince of Wales will read the Queen's Speech on Her Majesty's behalf, with the Duke of Cambridge also in attendance.'\\nAides stressed that the decision not to attend had only been taken yesterday \u2013 although contingency plans had long been put in place just in case.\\nThey also stressed the Queen has a 'busy diary' this week, with a call to Australia undertaken yesterday, a planned 'virtual' privy council meeting and her weekly audience with the Prime Minister by phone this afternoon.\\nSignificantly, she did have to authorise what are known as 'Letters Patent' \u2013 a legal expression of the monarch's 'will' \u2013 to delegate the opening of a new session of Parliament to her Counsellors of State, Prince Charles and Prince William.\\nIn order to prevent delay or difficulty in the dispatch of public business, the sovereign may issue Letters Patent delegating specified 'royal functions' to Counsellors of State if they are incapacitated.\\nCounsellors of state are the four most senior adult members of the British royal family and they currently still include Prince Andrew and Prince Harry \u2013 but neither are working royals and the latter does not even reside in the UK.\\nThe situation will increase pressure on Buckingham Palace to force a change of law, allowing Anne and Edward to step up instead should Charles or William be incapable of doing so.\\nIn recent years the Queen has slowly been shedding aspects of the pomp and ceremony around the State Opening to take account of her advancing years, such as wearing 'day dress' instead of heavy robes of state and a hat replacing her uncomfortable Imperial Crown.\\nIt will be the first time that William \u2013 who has been taking on increasing responsibilities \u2013 has joined his father as a future king. His presence is required as two Counsellors of State are needed to attend.\\nHe is due in Manchester later today with Kate to attend the official opening of the Manchester Arena attack memorial. The timing of the event is being adjusted slightly to take account of his new plans.\\nPrince Charles stood in following discussions between the Queen and her aides. He will be supported by his wife Camilla and Prince William.\\nA new Letters Patent authorised by the Queen was issued to cover the State Opening delegating to Counsellors of State the royal function of opening a new session of Parliament.\\nIn this instance, it enables Charles and William to jointly exercise that function. No other functions have been delegated by the Queen.\\nIt is the first time Her Majesty has missed the opening of Parliament for 59 years.\\nAnd she has only missed the event twice in her entire reign - in 1959 and 1963 when pregnant.\\nOn those occasions her speech, setting out the government's legislative plans for the coming year, was read by the Lord Chancellor, Viscount Kilmuir.\\n\\n\\nBoris Johnson\u00a0warned he cannot protect Brits from cost-of-living misery today as he unveiled Queen's Speech measures to get back on track after Partygate and disastrous local elections - including a crackdown on eco 'hooligans', a Levelling Up drive and a Brexit red tape bonfire.\\nAs the legislative agenda for the new Parliament was announced, the PM said that the government will do 'whatever we can to ease the burdens people are grappling with'.\\nBut despite growing demands for action as inflation surges towards 10 per cent and the economy stalls, Mr Johnson pointed to the existing \u00a322billion package of help, and insisted he would make long-term investments rather than try to ease the immediate pain.\\nThe approach was underlined by the absence of any fresh measures in the package of proposed laws - although minister have carefully refused to rule out an emergency Budget before the Autumn.\\nInstead the Parliamentary session - being kicked off by\u00a0Prince Charles rather than the Queen for the first time in six decades as she is suffering 'mobility issues' - focuses on broad reforms with a smattering of crowd-pleasing policies such as bolstering police powers to tackle disruptive protests.\\nSchools and higher education are being overhauled to help the post-Covid recovery, while owners of unused second homes are expected to be punished, and locals given more power over housing developments.\\nThere is also action to revive high streets, a shake-up to create Great British Railways, and a vehicle for the controversial privatisation of Channel 4 - as well as steps to ensure 'woke' attitudes do not hamper free speech at universities.\\nIn his introduction to the programme, Mr Johnson said: 'While we can be proud of what we have achieved, the economic aftershocks of COVID-19 and the biggest war in Europe since 1945 mean huge disruptions to the global economy, with people in every major country facing real pressures in the cost of living. No country is immune and no government can realistically shield everyone from the impact.\\n'It is right that we continue doing whatever we can to ease the burdens people are grappling with now, supporting the hardest hit with \u00a322 billion of help to address the cost of living and cutting hundreds of pounds off household bills.\\n'But we must also remember that for every pound of taxpayer's money we spend on reducing bills now, it is a pound we are not investing in bringing down bills and prices over the longer term.\\n'And that if anything, this moment makes clear our best remedy lies in urgently delivering on our mission to turbo charge the economy, create jobs and spread opportunity across the country.'\\nMr Johnson and Sir Keir have clashed bitterly over Partygate, Beergate and other issues - but appeared to share a joke as they walked from the Commons chamber to hear the speech in the Lords.\\nMr Johnson apparently quipped in a reference to the furore engulfing the Labour leader: 'Did you have a good weekend?'\\nLevelling Up and Regeneration Bill\\nSchools Bill\\nTransport Bill\\nEnergy Security Bill\\nDraft Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Bill\\nUK Infrastructure Bill\\nNon-Domestic Rating Bill\\nMedia Bill\\nProduct Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill\\nElectronic Trade Documents Bill\\nHigh Speed Rail (Crewe - Manchester) Bill\\nDraft Audit Reform Bill\\nBrexit Freedoms Bill\\nProcurement Bill\\nFinancial Services and Markets Bill\\nData Reform Bill\\nTrade (Australia and New Zealand) Bill\\nGenetic Technology (Precision Breeding) Bill\\nHigher Education Bill\\nSocial Housing Regulation Bill\\nRenters Reform Bill\\nHarbours (Seafarers' Remuneration) Bill\\nSocial Security (Special Rules for End of Life) Bill\\nPublic Order Bill\\nNational Security Bill\\nEconomic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill\\nModern Slavery Bill\\nOnline Safety Bill\\nDraft Victims Bill\\nDraft Protect Duty Bill\\nDraft Mental Health Act Reform Bill\\nBill of Rights\\nNorthern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill\\nIdentity and Language (Northern Ireland) Bill\\nAnimal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill\\nConversion Therapy Bill\\nHigher Education (Freedom of Speech) Bill\\nBoycotts, Divestment and Sanctions Bill\\nThe Prince of Wales read the Queen's Speech for the first time as the monarch misses the State Opening of Parliament for the first time in almost 60 years.\\nThe Queen, 96, pulled out of the ceremonial occasion \u2013 when she spells out the Government's legislative programme for the forthcoming parliamentary session \u2013 as she continued to experience 'episodic mobility problems'.\\nIn the Queen's absence, Charles took on the head of state's major constitutional duty, in a move which will be interpreted as a significant shift in his responsibilities as a king-in-waiting.\\nThe Duke of Cambridge, also a future monarch, attended the State Opening, the first time he has done so, with the royal function of opening a new parliament delegated to both Charles and William by the Queen.\\nThe monarch is understood to have watched proceedings on television, and will have her regular audience with the PM tomorrow.\\nAside from the pomp and ceremony, the Speech marks the start of a critical phase for Mr Johnson as he looks to restore his political fortunes.\\nThe PM has so far clung on despite Partygate and the dismal local election results, but the Tories are trailing Labour in the polls and the success of these policies are likely to decide who secures power at the next election.\\nIn comments ahead of the speech, Mr Johnson delivered a strong hint that he has abandoned the idea of calling an early election as storm clouds gather over the UK economy, saying the programme will need the full two years to complete.\\nCost-of-living\\nThe Queen's Speech promises to 'grow and strengthen the economy and help ease the cost-of-living crisis for families'.\\nBut the package of legislation merely reiterates measures that have already been announced - and decried by critics as not going far enough.\\nIn his introduction, Mr Johnson said the government will do 'whatever we can to ease the burdens people are grappling with'.\\nBut he added: 'We must also remember that for every pound of taxpayer's money we spend on reducing bills now, it is a pound we are not investing in bringing down bills and prices over the longer term. And that if anything, this moment makes clear our best remedy lies in urgently delivering on our mission to turbo charge the economy, create jobs and spread opportunity across the country.'\\nThe briefing notes highlight that the government has provided \u00a322billion of support to families in 2022-23, and 'will not hesitate to take further steps to support households if needed'.\\nOfficials stressed that helping people into work was the 'best approach' to easing the misery, pointing to education and training policies.\\nThe only nod to soaring energy bills is the Energy Security Bill, which the government says will 'deliver the transition to cheaper, cleaner and more secure energy'.\\nHowever, there has been mounting speculation that Rishi Sunak could bring forward an emergency Budget to take the edge off inflation - which is on track to reach 10 per cent in the coming months.\\nThere have been calls for measures such as suspending VAT on heating bills and making the \u00a3200 loan a grant.\\nCrackdown on eco 'hooligans'\\nPolice will be given powers to stop eco 'hooligans' blocking roads and inflicting misery on motorists, under plans announced today.\\nA Public Order Bill to tackle disruptive action by groups such as Extinction Rebellion was unveiled in the Queen's Speech.\\nThe Government had attempted to bring in the measures in January, but they were blocked by Labour and others in the House of Lords\\nA criminal offence of 'locking on' will be created to prevent activists chaining themselves to buildings, vehicles and other protesters.\\nIt will carry a maximum penalty of six months and an unlimited fine.\\nStop and search powers will allow police to detain campaigners carrying bike locks and other equipment designed to make themselves difficult to remove.\\nA new offence will also be introduced to specifically ban the obstruction of key national infrastructure such as airports, railways and newspaper printing presses, which will be punishable by up to 12 months in prison and an unlimited fine.\\nIt will also be illegal to obstruct major transport works, including disrupting the construction or maintenance of projects such as HS2.\\nAnd new Serious Disruption Prevention Orders will allow police to ban suspected troublemakers from attending specified events.\\nGroups such as Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain and Just Stop Oil have used guerrilla tactics to wreak havoc in recent years \u2013 stopping people getting to work and costing taxpayers millions because of the mammoth police operations.\\nPolicing minister Kit Malthouse said the measures are designed to stop\u00a0'hooligan' protests.\\nHe told BBC Breakfast: 'We have seen a number of very, very prolific, persistent offenders who decide to just flagrantly ignore the courts and so we'll be bringing in a new serious disruption prevention order which we can place on them as individuals to deter them, if you like, from this kind of hooligan way of protesting.\\n'We believe that protest is fundamental to our democracy but it has to be balanced against the rights of others to go about their business, and indeed keeping us all safe.\\n'I'm afraid some of the tactics we've seen recently haven't done that.'\\nHome Secretary Priti\u00a0Patel said: 'The law-abiding, responsible majority have had enough of antisocial, disruptive protests carried out by a self-indulgent minority who seem to revel in causing mayhem and misery for the rest of us.\\n'The Public Order Bill will give the police the powers they need to clamp down on this outrageous behaviour and ensure the British public can go about their lives without disruption.'\\nBrexit bonfire of red tape\\nA 'super seven' of post-Brexit Bills is designed to exploit the benefits of leaving the EU, from slashing red tape to bolstering protection for animals.\\nThe Tories hope the new agenda can ease the cost-of-living crisis and deliver a 'Brexit dividend' in time for the next general election.\\nThe package pledges to 'end the supremacy of European law', saying that reducing bureaucracy in areas such as data handling can save businesses \u00a31billion.\\nThe raft of legislation includes the Brexit Freedoms Bill, which the government says will ensure future regulation is 'proportionate and created in collaboration with business to help spur economic growth'.\\nRestrictions in areas such as gene editing are being loosened, with officials saying it has 'the potential to increase disease resistance in crops, which can reduce pesticide use, lower costs to farmers and increase food production'.\\nMr Johnson has said the overhaul will allow the UK to 'thrive as a modern, dynamic and independent country'.\\nTargeting under-used holiday homes and reviving high streets\\nA crackdown on under-used holiday home is flagged in the Queen's Speech.\\nThe Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill paves the way for councils to get discretionary powers to double council tax on second homes unless they are either regularly used or let out by their owners for at least 70 days per year.\\nUnlocking new powers for local authorities to bring empty premises back into use and instigate rental auctions of vacant commercial properties in town centres and on high streets\\nVacant property has become a festering issue in prime beauty spots, with locals frustrated at soaring prices preventing permanent residents getting on the housing ladder.\\nGovernment sources have said wealthy owners who leave homes unused will be expected to contribute to 'crucial services in a way that can really benefit the whole community and boost levelling up'. One option would be to deploy the revenue to cut council tax.\\nProperties that are not even furnished will face a 100 per cent increase in council tax after 12 months, rather than the current two years.\\nThe same Bill will include measures to revive England's high streets, with compulsory rental auctions to ensure landlords make shops that have been vacant for more than a year available to prospective tenants.\\nAuthorities will also be given greater powers to use compulsory purchase orders to deliver housing, regeneration schemes and infrastructure.\\nPlanning overhaul to give residents more rights\\nLocal residents are set to get rights to be consulted on 'design codes' spelling out the standards that housing developments must meet.\\nThe move is part of a new pared-back approach to planning reforms, intended to soothe Tory backbench alarm that changes will hit them in the shires.\\nMinisters will look at how the planning inspectorate handles targets on local housing requirements, with greenbelt and areas of natural beauty no longer forced to meet 'unrealistic' goals as long as they produce a plausible plan.\\nDevelopers will also need to pay a 'locally set, non-negotiable levy to deliver the infrastructure that communities need, such as housing, schools, GPs and new roads', according to the government.\\nA fast-track application category could also be added to the planning system for small builders in an effort to 'level the playing field' with big developers.\\nThe measures are contained in the Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill.\\nBoosting education watchdogs and curbing truancy\\nMinisters will crack down on truancy, beef up the powers of education watchdogs and reform the funding system in new legislation to create 'a school system that works for every child'.\\nUnder the plans laid out in the Queen's Speech, England's schools will be required to publish an attendance policy and there will be compulsory registers for children who are not in classrooms so the authorities can identify who is not receiving a full-time education.\\nThe measures will ensure pupils benefit from 'every possible hour in the classroom', Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said.\\nMr Johnson said education was 'at the very heart of this Government's agenda'.\\nThe Schools Bill will also include plans for schools to join multi-academy trusts (MATs), a proposal which has been resisted by education unions, with a strengthened regulatory framework giving greater powers to intervene when they are failing.\\nA new national funding formula is aimed at distributing cash on a 'fair and consistent basis', Ofsted will be given greater powers to crack down on illegally-operating 'unregistered schools' and the Teaching Regulation Agency's ability to investigate misconduct will be strengthened.\\nAs well as the measures on school attendance, in an attempt to make sure children do not slip through the cracks local authorities will be given a duty to provide support to home-schooling families.\\nLifelong learning loans\\nA Higher Education Bill will enable the introduction of the promised lifelong loan entitlement, allowing people to retrain at any point.\\nUnder the plan people can access a loan equivalent to four years of education, \u00a337,000 in today's fees, that they can use over their lifetime for a range of studies including shorter and technical courses.\\nNo Bill on Northern Ireland Protocol... yet\\nThe Queen's Speech does not include a specific Bill to axe the Northern Ireland protocol, despite threats from ministers after negotiations with the EU stalled.\\nHowever,\u00a0officials working for Foreign Secretary Liz Truss are reported to have drawn up draft legislation that would unilaterally remove the need for checks on all goods being sent from Britain to the province.\\nThe law would also ensure businesses in Northern Ireland are able to disregard EU rules and regulations and remove the power of the European Court of Justice to rule on issues relating to the region, according to The Times.\\nMs Truss is believed to have been told the proposed Bill could lead to a trade war with the bloc and there are rumours of disquiet in Cabinet - but could announce as soon as next week that the policy is being triggered.\\nThe issue has been thrown into sharp relief by the results in Stormont elections last week, with Sinn Fein becoming the largest party for the first time.\\nHowever, the DUP has vowed it will not agree to take the Deputy First Minister role until the protocol is addressed, meaning the executive cannot function as under the Good Friday Agreement both unionists and republicans must participate.\\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has been engaged in frantic talks with the parties in Belfast to try to find a way through the impasse.\\nThe government's briefing note on the Queen's Speech says it wants to see a 'strong functioning Northern Ireland Executive delivering a better, more prosperous, shared future for all the people of Northern Ireland'.\\n'As we have seen following the elections in Northern Ireland, the problems caused by the Protocol continue to stand in the way of an Executive being formed. In the interests of all communities of Northern Ireland, the Protocol needs to change,' the note added.\\n'We urge our partners in the EU to work with us, with new imagination and flexibility, to deliver that. We will continue to talk with the EU but we will not let that stand in the way of protecting peace and stability in Northern Ireland.\\n'As any responsible government would, we will take the steps necessary to protect all dimensions of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and meet our obligations under the New Decade New Approach Deal to protect Northern Ireland's place in the UK internal market.'\\nBritain to be further removed from European courts under new Bill of Rights plan to protect free speech\\nBritain will be further removed from the jurisdiction of European courts under plans for a new Bill of Rights that will seek to increase protections for free speech.\\nIt has been a long-time aim of the Conservatives to scrap Labour's 1998 Human Rights Act, which incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law, and replace it with a British bill of rights.\\nDavid Cameron made such a pledge before the 2015 general election, while his successor Theresa May promised to look at the UK's human rights framework once Brexit was done.\\nAhead of the 2019 election, Boris Johnson vowed to update the 1998 Act.\\nUnder plans included in today's Queen's Speech, ministers are promising to 'restore some common sense to our justice system'.\\nThe Bill of Rights will seek to establish the primacy of UK case law and clarify there is no requirement for British judges to follow rulings by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.\\nBritish courts will also be told they cannot interpret human rights in a more expansive manner that the ECHR.\\nMinisters are also promising the bill will defend freedom of speech by 'promoting greater confidence in society to\\nexpress views freely', and will reduce 'unncecessary litigation'.\\nThere is also a vow to crackdown on foreign criminals evading deportation due to human rights arguments.\\nMinisters set for new trans rights row with plan to outlaw 'abhorrent' gay conversion therapy but not action designed to prevent a change of gender\\nMinisters have set themselves up for a new culture war row with plans to make 'abhorrent' gay conversion therapy a criminal offence - but avoid a similar ban on trans therapy.\\nMinisters will push ahead with plans to criminalise conversion therapy seeking to change someone's sexual orientation.\\nThe Conversion Therapy Bill will outlaw the 'abhorrent' practice, often carried out by religious groups, that seeks to make gay men and women heterosexual.\\nBut under plans outlined in the Queen's speech the law will not apply to similar treatments aimed at stopping people changing their gender.\\nInstead the plan says there will be 'separate work to consider the issue of Transgender Conversion Therapy further'.\\nThe bill will also include protection for 'freedom of speech, ensuring parents, clinicians and teachers can continue to have conversations with people seeking support'.\\nThe passage of the legislation is likely to provoke yet more protests. When the proposed law was announced last month it led to criticism from Tory MPs and demonstrations in Westminster.\\nConversion therapy can, in extreme forms, include physical violence and torturous practices.\\nIt is not clear yet that the Government will be able to get the law through without including trans conversion therapy, with scores of Tory MPs prepared to rebel against it and force a change.\\nMinisters plot largest shake-up of train services in three decades with creation of Great British Railways\\nMinisters plot the largest shake-up of train services in three decades with creation of Great British Railways to end fragmented franchise system, improve reliability and keep fares down\\nSweeping reforms to the way Britain's rail network is run are being planned in a new Transport Bill designed to improve train services after years of falling standards and rising fares.\\nUnder measures unveiled in the Queen's Speech today, a new body called Great British Railways will be set up with powers to centralise control of 20,000 miles of track and the services with run on them.\\nIt will replace Network Rail, which was responsible for the tracks, but be given extra responsibilities to become a 'single national leader of the railways'.\\nIt will have additional powers to set most fares and timetables, sell tickets and issue contracts to private firms to run the trains themselves.\\nIn bringing it in, ministers are reversing three decades of a fractures system of franchises since British Rail was privatised under the premiership of John Major in the mid 1990s.\\nBut it is not designed to renationalise the railways, with GBR retaining 'reserve powers of direction' and firms handed a significant role' in a system designed to 'deliver a better experience for passengers and freight customers with more punctual and reliable services'.\\nTransport Secretary grant Shapps unveiled the planned changes last year, saying passengers had been failed by 'years of fragmentation, confusion and over-complication'.\\nMinisters push ahead with a \u00a31billion sale of Channel 4 in the face of luvvies' anger\\nMinisters will fuel the flames of another culture war battle as the Government pushes ahead with the sale of Channel 4.\\nNadine Dorries will go ahead with the \u00a31billion sale of the broadcaster despite a wave of criticism, most recently at the weekend's Baftas.\\nChannel 4 is owned by the Government but receives no public money, funding itself commercially.\\nBut Ms Dorries has vowed to push ahead, saying that the current ownsership is 'holding Channel 4 back from competing against streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon'.\\nThe Queen's Speech says a sale will 'unleash the potential of the UK's creative sector' and 'give it the tools it needs to succeed in the future as a public service broadcaster while protecting its distinctiveness'.\\nThe celebration of the great and the good in TV and film on Saturday evening was hijacked by a number of political statements, including one demand to 'get the Tories out', which had to be hastily cut from the televised broadcast.\\nA\u00a0number of Bafta winners used their speeches to hail the value of Channel 4 and criticise the Government.\\nJodie Comer claimed the leading actress award for her role in Channel 4's Help and thanked the broadcaster for 'believing in the script'.\\nGogglebox won its second TV Bafta for best constructed factual show and the chief executive of production company Studio Lambert, Stephen Lambert, used his speech to voice opposition to the Government's plans.\\nBritish ports to be handed powers to block ferry services from mooring if they pay crew less than minimum wage\\nThe government will hand British ports the power to block ferry services from mooring if they do not pay their crew the minimum wage.\\nIn action prompted by the P&O scandal, new legislation unveiled in the Queen's Speech will crackdown on ferry companies seeking to underpay their staff.\\nUnder what has been titled the Harbours (Seafarers' Remuneration) Bill, ministers are seeking to ensure ferry crews are paid at least \u00a39.50 an hour while in UK waters.\\nThe proposed laws will hand ports the power to surcharge ferry operators if they pay less than this.\\nAnd harbour authorities across the UK will even be given the power to ultimately refuse access to ferry services if they do not comply.\\nIn March, P&O sacked close to 800 workers and set out plans to replace them with cheaper agency workers.\\nThe firm, which is owned by Dubai-based DP World, was widely condemned for the move and for giving its staff zero notice their employment was being terminated.\\nP&O's high-earning boss later admitted he would be paying replacement staff below the minimum wage at \u00a35.50 an hour.\\nThe firm insisted this was allowed under international maritime rules and said the company had no future without the dramatic action.\\nUnions have claimed that some Indian agency workers are being paid less than \u00a32 an hour by P&O.\\nThe government's new bill seeks to close 'legislative gaps' used by some ferry companies operating in and out of UK ports to avoid paying crew less than the minimum wage.\\nMinisters confirm post-Brexit ban on live animal exports and action on trophy hunting - but drop plans to stop imports of fur and foie gras\\nA post-Brexit ban on live animal exports is finally set to be put in place as ministers aim to deliver on manifesto commitments to strengthen animal welfare.\\nIt has been confirmed that the Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill will return to Parliament after being carried over from the last session.\\nThe Government also used the Queen's Speech to restate its commitment to legislating to ban the import of hunting trophies.\\nHowever, there is no return of previous plans to impose import bans on fur products and foie gras, which have now been abandoned.\\nMinisters ran out of time to complete the passage of the Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill - along with a number of other pieces of legislation - in the last parliamentary session.\\nThe need to deal with large amounts of Covid legislation was blamed for the lack of progress in other areas.\\nAs part of the bill, ministers are seeking to use the UK's Brexit freedoms to ban the export of livestock abroad for fattening and slaughter.\\nThis will prevent thousands of animals having to face journeys of more than 18 hours from Britain to the Continent.\\nThe legislation will also ban the keeping of primates as pets without a licence and include measures to tackle puppy smuggling, such as raising the minimum age that pets can travel into Britain and banning imports of dogs with cropped ears and docked tails.\\nThere will also be the creation of a specific new offence for pet abduction and updates to laws concerning zoos.\\n'Her Majesty's Government's priority is to grow and strengthen the economy and help ease the cost of living for families. My Government will level up opportunity in all parts of the country and support more people into work.\\n'Her Majesty's Ministers will continue to support the police to make the streets safer, and fund the National Health Service to reduce the COVID backlogs. In these challenging times, Her Majesty's Government will play a leading role in defending democracy and freedom across the world, including continuing to support the people of Ukraine.\\n'Her Majesty's Government will drive economic growth to improve living standards and fund sustainable investment in public services.\\n'This will be underpinned by a responsible approach to the public finances, reducing debt while reforming and cutting taxes. Her Majesty's Ministers will support the Bank of England to return inflation to its target.\\n'A Bill will be brought forward to drive local growth, empowering local leaders to regenerate their areas, and ensuring everyone can share in the United Kingdom's success.\\n'The planning system will be reformed to give residents more involvement in local development.\\n'Her Majesty's Government will improve transport across the United Kingdom, delivering safer, cleaner services and enabling more innovations.\\n'Legislation will be introduced to modernise rail services and improve reliability for passengers.\\n'Her Majesty's Ministers will bring forward an Energy Bill to deliver the transition to cheaper, cleaner, and more secure energy. This will build on the success of the COP26 Summit in Glasgow last year.\\n'Draft legislation to promote competition, strengthen consumer rights and protect households and businesses will be published. Measures will also be published to create new competition rules for digital markets and the largest digital firms.\\n'Her Majesty's Government will establish the UK Infrastructure Bank in legislation, with objectives to support economic growth and the delivery of net zero.\\n'Reforms to education will help every child fulfil their potential wherever they live, raising standards and improving the quality of schools and higher education.\\n'Her Majesty's Ministers will publish draft legislation to reform the Mental Health Act.\\n'Her Majesty's Government will continue to seize the opportunities of the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union, to support economic growth.\\n'Regulations on businesses will be repealed and reformed. A bill will enable law inherited from the European Union to be more easily amended.\\n'Public sector procurement will be simplified to provide new opportunities for small businesses.\\n'New legislation will strengthen the United Kingdom's financial services industry, ensuring that it continues to act in the interest of all people and communities. The United Kingdom's data protection regime will be reformed.\\n'Her Majesty's Government will continue to champion international trade, delivering jobs across the country and growing the economy.

It will continue to invest in our gallant Armed Forces. Her Majesty's Ministers will work closely with international partners to maintain a united NATO and address the most pressing global security challenges.\\n'The continued success and integrity of the whole of the United Kingdom is of paramount importance to Her Majesty's Government, including the internal economic bonds between all of its parts.\\n'Her Majesty's Government will prioritise support for the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and its institutions, including through legislation to address the legacy of the past.\\n'Her Majesty's Government will ensure the constitution is defended.
