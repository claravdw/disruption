He has five grandchildren in total, including Princess Charlotte, six,\u00a0 and Prince Louis, three, from William and Archie, two, and Lilibet, four months, from Prince Harry.\\nClimate editor Justin Rowlatt replied to Charles 'All of our grandchildren if we're lucky enough to have them, will inherit the earth that we bequeath them.'\\n'How worried are you about the state of that inheritance?'\\nCharles replied: 'Deeply worried.\\n'I've always felt that we are somehow trained to believe that nature is a separate thing from us that we can just exploit.'\\nCharles also said he understands the frustrations of young people and climate activists because they feel like 'nobody listens'.\\nRecalling his own encounter with his Extinction Rebellion, the royal recalled how the group staged a sit-in at his Highgrove estate before leaving a letter praising him for his past comments on the climate.\\nHe also revealed how he doesn't eat meat and fish on two days a week and dairy on one day.\\nMost remarkably, he explained how he had his Aston Martin converted so it runs on surplus English wine and whey from cheese production.\\nThe car, which he has had for 51 years, now runs on a fuel called E85 - made up of 85 per cent bioethanol and 15 per cent unleaded petrol.\\nDescribing his diet, he added: 'That's one way to do it. If more people did that it would reduce a lot of the pressure on the environment.'\\nSpeaking about Greta Thunberg and other climate activists, Charles said: 'All these young people feel nothing is ever happening so of course they're going to get frustrated. I totally understand because nobody would listen and they see their future being totally destroyed.'\\nDiscussing recent protests, he also added: 'I understand why they go out but it isn't helpful to do it in a way that alienates people.\\n'I totally understand the frustration. The difficulty is how do you direct that frustration in a way that is more constructive than destructive.'\\nCharles, a long-standing environmental campaigner, said it had taken 'far too long' for the world to take the climate crisis seriously.\\nHe added: 'The point is, people should really notice how despairing so many young are.'\\nThe Prince of Wales even took aim at electric cars in his interview, warning that they are too expensive and sharing his worries about materials for their batteries.\\nHe said: 'At the moment there is a huge amount of waste which is really worrying.'", "image": [["Prince Charles has revealed how he named the autumn garden at his Balmoral home after his first grandchild Prince George.

I'm not joking. My son needs to get to school and I need to get to work.'\\nAs she moves to lean over one of the sitting protesters, she says:\u00a0'Move out the way. Move out the way now,' before returning to her car while saying: 'I'll drive through you then. My son is 11 and he needs to get to school.'\\nOne of the protesters turns to the woman and says 'you can't drive through us' before the infuriated woman again says her son needs to get to school and that she needs to get to work.\\nThe protester tells the woman 'she understands' and that she is 'sorry' about blocking her route.\\nBut the infuriated driver says: 'Move out the way then. Move out of the way and let me get my son to school.'\\nThe woman then gets back into her car and starts driving it forwards into the back of the protesters as one of them shouts 'ow, ow ow, no' while other observers can be heard in the background encouraging the woman to keep driving.\\nOne says: 'That's it. That's it, go on, push them. Get out of the road you silly c****.'

They were glued to the road on behalf of his children.'\\nMr Whipster denied the group blocked an ambulance during its recent protest at Wandsworth Bridge in south-west London.\\n'I personally unclogged 50ft of traffic in front of the ambulance, it was on the opposite side of the road, the opportunity to drive away was there,' he said.\\n'I appreciate the chaos of the situation. I've seen the clips on social media and it certainly looks like there was an ambulance that we were blocking.\\n'The ambulance was behind the camera though. He was in the opposite carriageway and we did clear the road.'\\nHe added that he had resigned himself to the possibility of potentially being thrown in prison or breaking court injunctions with his continued protesting.\\nThe Insulate Britain campaigner said: 'I am concerned, I have a house I was hoping I could grow old and die in. If I lose my house, so be it.\\n'I can't not make the voices of the 8,000 people that are dying from fuel poverty heard and children that are going to die from CO2 emissions and the people currently in meaningless work that really could have proper jobs insulating homes.\\n'To me, that's a price to pay. If I end up in prison, if I end up losing every single penny I have, I've done all that I can do. So yes, I care deeply about losing my house and my liberty, but the bigger priority is being here now.'\\nThe eco-zealots last week revealed they would\u00a0'suspend their campaign of civil resistance' until October 25 - ahead of the Cop26 summit in November.\\nActivists penned a letter to Boris Johnson\u00a0saying they would stop their hated antics and quoted the PM's hero Sir Winston Churchill in an apparent bid to win him over.\\nThe surprise move was just hours after it emerged more than a dozen of their members will finally face court action and possible jail within days.\\nJust over a month after the first roadblocks brought chaos to the motorways, officials are set to ask judges to take action against the eco-warriors.\\nDear Prime Minister,\\n'Owing to past neglect, in the face of the plainest of warnings, we have entered upon a period of danger.\\nThe era of procrastination, of half measures, of soothing baffling expedients, of delays is coming to its close. In its place we are entering a period of consequence.' (Winston Churchill 1936)\\nInsulate Britain would like to take this opportunity to profoundly acknowledge the disruption caused over the past five weeks. We cannot imagine undertaking such acts in normal circumstances. But the dire reality of our situation has to be faced.\\nThe facts are laid out by Sir David King, the former chief scientific advisor to the UK government, he said 'We have to move quickly. What we do, I believe, in the next 3 to 4 years will determine the future of humanity'.\\nThe collapse of the climate is happening around us. We face economic chaos and the breakdown of law and order in a matter of years. We will lose our incomes, pensions, and savings while passing on an appalling legacy to our children. They will be rightly furious. Around the world thousands of millions of people will lose their lives through slaughter and starvation as crops fail and society collapses.\\nAhead of COP26, Insulate Britain will suspend its campaign of civil resistance until Monday 25th October. In light of the speech you made (to the UN on the 22nd September) in which you recognised that 'We are approaching that critical turning point \u2013 in less than two months \u2013 when we must show that we are capable of learning, and maturing, and finally taking responsibility for the destruction we are inflicting, not just upon our planet but ourselves', we ask you to use this time to signal that you believe what you say.\\nWe invite you to make a meaningful statement that we can trust, a statement that the country wants to hear: that your government will live up to its responsibilities to protect us, to defend law and order; that your government will take the lead needed to insulate and retrofit our homes; that it will 'get on with the job' so families can feed their children and keep their homes warm.\\nWe invite you to do the right thing, so we can be secure in the knowledge that our government did everything it could to protect and defend our country.\\nYours sincerely,\\nInsulate Britain\\nInsulate Britain's letter to the PM revealed it planned to suspend protests for 11 days.\\nIt said:\u00a0'Insulate Britain would like to take this opportunity to profoundly acknowledge the disruption caused over the past five weeks.\\n'We cannot imagine undertaking such acts in normal circumstances.

Their protests continued despite a series of injunctions.\\nRetired Anglican vicar Reverend Sue Parfitt, 79, a regular Insulate Britain and XR activist, was among those being arrested on the M25 last week. She has already been arrested at other M25 protests on September 13, 21 and 29.\\nThe group has blocked parts of major roads around London, including the M25 and M4, to draw attention to climate change.\\nOn Tuesday protesters set light to court injunction papers that had been individually served on them, on the pavement outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London.\\nA High Court hearing was taking place over three injunctions granted to National Highways, covering the M25, Port of Dover and major A roads around London.\\nA previously-announced plan to use a catch-all injunction against Insulate Britain is understood to have hit the legal buffers.\\nOfficials had said they planned to obtain a 'contra mundum injunction' with far more sweeping terms that would be easier to enforce.\\nBut lawyers told ministers they would have to list the 'essential nature' of each separate motorway and A road in the country in order to secure such an injunction.\\nIn the face of such an administrative nightmare, the idea is now thought to have been ditched.\\nThe Mail reported last month how Insulate Britain is planning to fill Britain's jails with hundreds of eco-activists in an attempt to create a 'political crisis' for PM Boris Johnson.\\nThey believe significant numbers of activists being jailed could light a powder keg on wider disorder, in the run-up to the Cop26 environment summit in Glasgow next month.\\nIn September, activist Shel MacDonagh said 300 individuals would need to get themselves jailed in order to force the Government to grant concessions to the group.\\n'We need this campaign to continue going, and we think we need in the ballpark of 300 people to be able to face prison for us to be able to get a chance for this [a government concession] to happen,' she said.\\nPriti Patel, the Home Secretary, has announced plans for a new type of Asbo to tackle the protests.\\nCriminal Disruption Prevention Orders - dubbed 'Asbos for crusties' - are intended to be quicker to enforce than injunctions.\\nA specific new offence will also be created to deal with protests by Insulate Britain and its parent group Extinction Rebellion.\\nIt will be made a crime to 'interfere with critical national infrastructure', including major roads, railways, seaports, power stations and newspaper printing presses.\\nThe new crime will carry up to six months' imprisonment. However, both new powers will have to pass through Parliament and are not expected to come into force until spring or summer next year.\\nInsulate Britain is run by\u00a0ringleader Norton, whose own home was found to have no cavity wall insulation.\\nOther leaders in the secretive group include Extinction Rebellion veteran David McKenny and\u00a0Cathy Eastburn, whose husband was revealed to be\u00a0Ben Plowden, a Transport for London director. He has stepped down from his \u00a3170,000-a-year role.\\nEastburn had previously vowed to 'unleash hell' on drivers during her protesting, despite her long-term partner Mr Plowden's role in charge of the Covid Restart and Recovery Scheme.\\nIt is understood TfL bosses were aware of her views and actions, but insist it was Mr Plowden who resigned for unrelated reasons to 'pursue new opportunities'.\\nThe group, which is calling on the Government to insulate all homes across the UK by 2030 to help cut carbon emissions, has been protesting since September 13.\\nLast week Boris Johnson blasted Insulate Britain protesters as 'irresponsible crusties', saying the eco-zealots who have repeatedly blocked highways in recent weeks were 'doing considerable damage to the economy'.\\nMs Patel told the Conservative Party conference in Manchester that 'measures already going through Parliament will ensure these criminals can be brought to justice for the disruption they are causing'.\\nCriminal Disruption Prevention Orders will prevent individuals from taking part in particular protests, and it will become an offence to interfere with critical national infrastructure.\\nIt is hoped they will be quicker to enforce than the civil injunctions taken out by National Highways.\u00a0Protesters could face up to two years in jail or an unlimited fine if they are found in breach of the injunctions.\\nAn Insulate Britain protester who blocked busy roads as part of climate change demonstrations has come under fire after it was revealed she embarked on a 81,000 mile trip across the globe in a diesel-fulled Toyota.\\nEmma Smart, 44, was charged with obstructing traffic in Weymouth and Dorchester as part of a climate change protest in May this year.\\nShe was also pictured sitting cross-legged alongside other eco protesters as they blocked the roads near the M25 at Dartford.\\nHowever the eco protester, who previously worked as biologist, has now come under fire after it was revealed she and her partner Andy drove 80,975 miles visiting 50 countries in 858 days in an 18-year-old Toyota from 2012 to 2016.\\nAhead of her trip in 2012 Ms Shaw told BBC: 'It's a massive scale it's taken 18 months of planning and saving and we are working extremely hard but here we are now about to set off and it's all very real.'\\nThe couple broke their global trip into four phases and regularly blogged about their travesl inside their 4x4.\\nThe first leg of their trip saw them travel to France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Mongolia, Russia, Ukraine and Poland.\\nThis was followed by visits to\u00a0Portugal, Morocco, Western Sahara, Spain and\u00a0 Andorra.\\nThe couple also travelled to Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Italy, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro and Kosova along their world expedition.\\nHowever the Insulate Britain protester has now come under fire for the\u00a0gas-guzzling trip, with some calling Ms Shaw's global tour 'hypocrisy at its very finest'.\\nOne person took to social media to write: 'This is one of the #InsulateBritain protestors Emma Smart who felt \u201ccompelled\u201d to stop traffic on the M25 this morning\u2026hypocrisy at its very finest! 81k miles the trip!'\\nWhile another commented: 'Emma Smart #InsulateBritain happily driving around the world on a jolly holiday without a care for the #ClimateEmergency.\\n'Now lies on the roads stopping people going to work... #Hypocrite.'\\nAnother person added: 'Yes, the same Emma Smart from Weymouth who chose to drive nearly 81,000 miles around the world.'\\nElsewhere one person said: 'Really, what about the planet?'\\nMs Shaw told The Sun: 'The research I carried out before the trip in 2012 concluded we would produce 62 per cent less CO2 per day adventuring compared with our situation living in a shared house of four people in the UK.\\n'For the last two years, I have dedicated my life voluntarily to helping people in this country and around the world get out of this crisis we are all in together.\\n'With Insulate Britain, I have again found hope.'\\nEarlier this month more than 100 Insulate Britain activists were served with an injunction against road-blocking protests.\\nThe original injunction, granted to National Highways on September 21, banned the demonstrations on the M25 and was followed by a second approved on September 24 which restricted protests around the Port of Dover.\\nA third injunction was granted this month, banning them from obstructing traffic and access to motorways and major A roads in and around London.\\nHowever the move did not stop protests and the group, which is calling on the Government to insulate all homes across the UK by 2030 to help cut carbon emissions, continued to protest on London roads.\\n", "image": [["A woman who was infuriated with Insulate Britain protesters blocking the road told them 'I'll

A memoir reflecting on white privilege is stacked alongside children's books.", "text": "From Little House On The Prairie to Dr Seuss, bedtime reading for children is rapidly becoming a battlefield with classic stories slapped with\u00a0'trigger warnings' for 'harmful content' or popular authors such as Enid Blyton 'cancelled'.\\nBut waiting on the shelves of a bookshop near you to replace them is a whole raft of suitably 'woke' literature for children, ranging from\u00a0feminist fairytales to tomes teaching young people about white privilege and subverting gender roles.\\nWaterstones, for instance, is currently displaying books such as How To Be A Better White Person, Gender Swapped Fairy Tales and alternative bedtime stories, such as the tale of a gingerbread man refugee.\\nAwkwardly, the retailer has mixed in the adult satire My First Little Book of Intersectional Activism - a satire on woke culture written by British comedian Andrew Doyle - with the children's books.\\nOthers include an anthology of bedtime stories based on activists and politicians rather than princesses, as well as revamped feminist nursery rhymes.\\nHere Femail reveals the selection of reads on offer for the woke bookshelf.\\nGender Swapped Fairy Tales\\nGender Swapped Fairy Tales is a collection of revised classic stories written by wife-and-husband team Karrie Fransman and Jonathan Plackett, created to\u00a0challenge perceptions of gender.\\nThe 12 traditional stories were re-written using a\u00a0computer algorithm that simply swapped the gendered language of the originals, for example changing 'king' to 'queen'.\\nFeaturing tales such as 'Cinder, or the Little Glass Slipper', in which an old queen leers over a young prince and\u00a0'Handsome and the Beast' - the authors aimed to reinvent characters rather than storylines of classic tales.\\nThe idea for the anthology of fairy tales came from\u00a0Jonathan, whose father used to swap the genders of the characters when he would read bedtime stories.\\n'The story of the book begins when I was a little boy and my dad used to read me and my sister bedtime stories and what we didn't know was he was secretly gender swapping some of the characters in the books', he said on the Reading Corner podcast.\\n'So that kind of made it more interesting for him but gave me and my sister a bunch of characters that didn't conform to normal gender stereotypes.'\\nThe Black Friend: On Being a Better White Person\\nNestled alongside the children's book is\u00a0Frederick Joseph's memoir, The Black Friend: On Being a Better White Person.\\nWritten from the perspective of a friend, the book speaks directly to young white people to detail the racism and mircoraggressions the author has experienced throughout his life.\\nIt offers advice to young people on how they can acknowledge their white privilege and touches on subjects such as\u00a0cultural appropriation and 'reverse racism'.\\nThe book details his transfer to a largely white high school as a teen, sharing\u00a0race-related anecdotes and explaining how they are harmful.\\nIn the book, Joseph says that many young people have witnessed racism even if they're unaware of it.\\nJoseph writes: 'We all live in some sort of bubble, whether of race, gender, sexuality, religion, or other aspects of our identities or lived experience'.\\nThe US-born author claims: 'Having the ability to survive without having to know or develop a level of respect for groups of people is part of the legacy of American racism and white privilege.'\\nOn the concept of 'reverse racism' in the US, he writes: 'Racism and racist systems in America don't adversely impact white people. This is because all aspects of racism in America are rooted in white supremacy and are designed to negatively impact everyone except white people'.\\nEach chapter includes the voice one artist or activist, including Moonlight Tarell Alvin McCraney, the\u00a0creator of the\u00a0OscarsSoWhite hashtag\u00a0April Reign and\u00a0Angie Thomas, author of The Hate U Give.\\nGood Night Stories for Rebel Girls\\nGood Night Stories for Rebel Girls, published initially in 2016, is a children's book aimed at ages six and up, which was funded through crowdfunding online.\\nThe book, written by Elena Favilli and Francesca Cavallo, features short stories about 100 real women,\u00a0illustrated by 60 female artists from all over the world, who can be role models to children.\\nThe list includes\u00a0Malala Yousafzai, the Nobel Prize-winning Pakistani teenager who was shot by the Taliban in 2012 and\u00a0American gymnast Simone Biles, one of the most decorated gymnasts of all time.\\nOther women include experts in their filed such as American computer scientist Grace Hopper and celebrities and sports personalities like Serena Williams and Michelle Obama.\\nStories for Boys Who Dare to Be Different and\u00a0Stories for Kids Who Dare to be Different\\nThe release of Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls inspired author Ben Brooks and illustrator Quinton Winter to write Stories for Boys Who Dare to be Different - aimed at a male audience.\\nThe 2018 children's book featured role models including Salvador Dali, Barack Obama, Beethoven and Stormzy.\\nThe duo later published a book aimed at a gender-neutral demographic containing a mixture of male and female role models titled Stories for Kids Who Dare to be Different.\\nThe list of inspirational people included in this version of the book includes; Dr Seuss, Whoopi Goldberg, Andy Warhol, Ellen MacArthur, Greta Gerwig and Andrea Bocelli.\\nFearless Fairy Tales\\nWritten by TV presenter\u00a0Konnie Huq and author James Kay, Fearless Fairytales is a collection of classic stories which have been updated for a new generation of readers.\\nCharacters include\u00a0Trumplestiltskin, a vain and gold-obsessed man who will stop at nothing to become richer, and the princess whose only dream is to become Chancellor of the Exchequer -\u00a0Sleeping Brainy.\\nThe Gingerbread Kid escapes persecution in his home country but struggles to fit in in his new one - with children shouting: \u2018Run, run, we don\u2019t care if you skid - you can\u2019t sit with us, little gingerbread kid!\u2019 while\u00a0Rap-Unzel gets the chance of fame by appearing on Kingdom's Got Talent.\\nWhat Are Little Girls Made of?\\nPoetry book What Are Little Girls Made of? is made up of re-workings of classic nursery rhymes through a feminist lens.\\nWritten by award-winning author Jeanne Willis with illustrations by\u00a0Isabelle Follath, the book was published in 2020 and includes takes on songs including\u00a0Little Bo-Peep and\u00a0Humpty Dumpty.\\nIn Georgie Porgie, he doesn't dare to make the girls cry, in Little Bo-Peep the protagonist wades through slime to rescue her flock, while in\u00a0Humpty Dumpty the egg is saved by a female doctor.\\nMy First Little Book of Intersectional Activism\\nAlongside the stacks of 'woke' children's books, staff have bizarrely placed a copy of\u00a0My First Little Book of Intersectional Activism - a\u00a0satire on woke culture written by British comedian\u00a0Andrew Doyle.\\nThe comedy book is written under the pseudonym\u00a0Titania McGrath, who\u00a0Doyle describes as\u00a0'a militant vegan who thinks she is a better poet than William Shakespeare'.\\nThe entirely satirical book pokes fun at figures such as Greta Thunberg, writing that 'whenever she spoke at major political institutions, berating the older generation for condemning their offspring to certain death, the effect was mesmerising. She truly touched the heartstrings of everyone she shouted at.'\\nThe book teases she has 'supernatural powers' to 'levitate from country to country without the need for conventional transportation powered by scarce fossil fuels'.\\nIn one chapter dedicated to Abraham Lincoln - which features an illustration with the tagline 'make America woke again' - the author jokes that Hillary Clinton was 'robbed of the presidency on the flimsy grounds that she failed to get enough votes'.\\nWriting about Extinction Rebellion, the author's moniker calls out 'selfish miscreants' who are more concerned with 'trying to get to work' or 'going into hospital for cancer treatment' than the ice caps melting.\\nThe comedian's pseudonym, Titania, says it should be compulsory for anyone under the age of 16 to join the movement in a bid to both 'prevent Armageddon' and help defeat white supremacy and the patriarchy.\\nThe book has received rave reviews from the likes of\u00a0Piers Morgan, who said it's the choice for you 'if virtue-signalling wokery drives you as nuts as it drives me'.\\nDoyle's first book under the pseudonym was titled Woke: A Guide to Social Justice and was hailed as 'beautiful classic satire' by Ricky Gervais, while critics from the Spectator called it 'hilarious'.\\nLittle Legends: Exceptional Men in Black History\\nNew York Times bestseller\u00a0Little Leaders: Exceptional Men in Black History relates true stories of black men throughout history.\\nWritten by\u00a0Vashti Harrison, the book tells the story of\u00a0Jamaican-born physician Doctor Harold Moody who\u00a0campaigned against racial prejudice after moving to the UK.\\nActivist Paul Stephenson, who is a long-time campaigner for civil rights for the British African-Caribbean community, is also featured in the book alongside\u00a0Ghanaian diplomat Kofi Annan.\\nOthers included in the book includes architect Sir David Adjaye who designed\u00a0National Museum of African American History, comic book author Dwayne McDuffie and the musician Prince.\\nHey You!

Woke babies cry out for justice. Woke babies grow up to change the world'.\\nThe illustrations show a black baby wearing a onesie with a panther emblem on his chest. The text alongside them reads, 'Look at your fists. Fingers curled into a panther's paw pointing up up up, reaching out for justice.'\\nSeeing Gender\\nAnother example is\u00a0Seeing Gender: An Illustrated Guide to Identity and Expression which offers an 'investigation into how we express and understand the complexities of gender today'.\\nWritten by\u00a0Iris Gottlieb, the book focuses on the author's own experiences with gender.\\nThe book, which features colourful cartoons to illustrate their points, is aimed at 'intelligent, curious, want-to- be woke people who care about how we see and talk about gender and sexuality in the 21st century'.\\n\\nClassic children's books in a Cambridge University archive are set to be labelled with\u00a0'trigger warnings' for 'harmful content relating to slavery, colonialism and racism'.\\nResearchers are reviewing more than 10,000 books and magazines to expose offensive authors after campaigners demanded teachers censor racial slurs when reading Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird.\\nWith other modern classics like Little House On The Prairie and the works of\u00a0Dr Seuss dubbed as potentially harmful, Femail has examined other children's texts which have come under fire.\\nCriticism includes that of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book which was slammed for it's 'colonial' depiction of animals and\u00a0Roald Dahl's Matilda which was dubbed transphobic for it's portrayal of masculine Miss Trunchbull.\\nHere, FEMAIL takes a look at what other much-loved bedtime stories could be at risk of being 'cancelled'.\\nTHE JUNGLE BOOK\\nRudyard Kipling's 1894 work The Jungle book is a collection of stories\u00a0set in a forest in India with a cast of animals and\u00a0'man-cub' Mowgli, who is raised in the jungle by wolves.\\nWhile the book and it's many adaptions have been a childhood favourite for many, the novel itself has come under fire for forming part of the construction of 'colonial English national identity'.\\nIn 2001,\u00a0academic Jopi Nyman argued that the book's depiction of\u00a0Indian children and animals contribute 'imagining of Englishness as a site of power and racial superiority'.\\nHe argued that all animals are not portrayed equally in the book and the author depicts 'colonial animals as racialised' while characters such as the 'White Seal' promote the 'true English identity'.\\nKipling's 1899 poem The White Man's Burden has been criticised in modern times for advocating colonialism and portraying other races as inferior.\\nIn 2012,\u00a0former England footballer John Barnes said that literature like The Jungle Book has instilled bigotry in the minds of generations of British children.\\nSpeaking to students at Liverpool University, he said: 'Over the last 200 years we have had negative images of black people.'\\nHe added: 'There are examples everywhere. Rudyard Kipling, one of our greatest heroes, wrote The White Man's Burden, in which he wrote it was incumbent on the Americans to go and civilise the savages in the Philippines.'\\nIn 2018, students at the University of Manchester\u00a0painted over Rudyard Kipling's venerated poem 'If' because they deemed it\u00a0'deeply inappropriate' and upsetting to ethnic minorities.\\nA team removed Kipling's verses and accused the university of insulting students by putting it up without consulting them and saying: 'Black and brown voices have been written out of history enough'.\\nA 1967 film adaptation of Kipling's novel, has also been highlighted, namely for its depiction of the ape King Louie, which has been accused of perpetuating a stereotype of African Americans.\\nMATILDA\\nRoald Dahl's beloved 1988 novel\u00a0Matilda has been a favourite among young readers for decades, telling the story of a young girl who escapes her abusive parents with the help of her kind teacher miss Honey.\\nHowever it's not\u00a0Mr. and Mrs. Wormwood some readers have a problem with, with one online critic claiming the depiction of Matilda's tyrannical headmistress, Miss Trunchbull, is transphobic.\\nThe character is portrayed as having a\u00a0\u00a0'gigantic and formidable' physique including with large shoulders, arms and legs with a 'deep and dangerous voice'. She wears non-feminine clothing and is known by her last name rather than her first, which is Agatha.\\nMeanwhile, Miss Honey is perceived as much more feminine, beautiful and smaller than\u00a0Miss Trunchbull, described as\u00a0'like a porcelain figure.'\\nAccording to one online critic writing for Salon magazine,\u00a0Trunchbull is an allegory for 'the hubris of being transgender'.\\n'Women should know their limitations and never imitate a man's authority or physical prowess, lest he intervene to remind them who's boss'.\\nLast year Sainsbury's shoppers stripped mugs from their shelves that carried\u00a0the phrase, 'a brilliant idea hit her', an adaptation from a sentence from\u00a0Trunchbull in the children's classic, 'the germ of a brilliant idea hit her'.\\nActivists accused the supermarket of encouraging 'domestic violence' through the 'hugely problematic' Miss Trunchbull-style kitchen essential.\\nSeveral of Dahl's works have been lambasted over the years, including\u00a0James and the Giant Peach which was criticised for racist remarks including a grasshopper that says\u00a0'I'd rather be fried alive and eaten by a Mexican.'\\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory has also been criticised for it's original depiction of\u00a0Oompa-Loompas as\u00a0African pygmies, which was revised after\u00a0exchanges with Eleanor Cameron, a children's author who objected to the racist content.\\nLast year the Dahl family issued an apology for the author's history of\u00a0antisemitism, with the author\u00a0 publicly admitting harboured anti-Semitic views in an interview shortly before his death at age 74.\\nHARRY POTTER\\nLast year J.K. Rowling was embroiled in a series of transphobia rows after mocking an online article using the words 'people who menstruate' and featuring a\u00a0male serial killer who dresses as a woman to slay his victims in her latest book.\\nBut it's not just the author's personal opinions that online critics have dubbed as offensive, with a handful of Harry Potter readers claiming that the book's portrayal of goblins is anti-Semitic.\\nGringotts Wizarding Bank is the only\u00a0only bank of the wizarding world and is owned and operated by goblins who are said to be 'clever as they come, but not the most friendly of beasts.'\\nCritics on social media have claimed that these goblins, who feature hooked noses and are obsessed with the ownership of gold, are based on antisemitic stereotypes and tropes of Jews.\\nSeveral critics have disputed this claim, pointing out 2004 comments from Rowling herself comparing terminology in the book such as 'mud blood' to anti-Semitic propaganda of the Nazis and how Lord Voldemort is based, in part, off of Hitler.\\nIn fact, Rowling herself responded to comments from her\u00a0Jewish fans in 2014, clarifying that there\u00a0were Jewish students at the fictional Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\\nShe revealed the name of one of them, Anthony Goldstein, who was among the original 40 students mentioned in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the first book in the series.\\nBEAUTY AND THE BEAST\\nSome critics have claimed that Beauty and the Beast isn't so much a romantic love story as it is a tale about a kidnapped young girl who develops Stockholm Syndrome.\\nThe original tale, written by French novelist Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve and published in 1740, has been adapted several times including into the much-loved\u00a01991 animation.\\nAfter being locked up and forbidden to leave the castle by the Beast, Belle eventually finds herself falling in love with her captor, empathising with him and seemingly forgiving him for taking her prisoner.\\nStockholm Syndrome describes the phenomenon of people forming alliances with their captors. It was named in 1973, when four hostages taken in a bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden defended their captors, refusing to testify against them in court after being released.\\nHowever, Emma Watson - who played Belle in Disney's live-action take on the story, said while she 'grappled' with the question at the beginning, she ultimately decided that her character was able to 'keep her independence'.\\nThe story has also been criticised for promoting domestic violence, with Belle trapped in an abusive relationship with the Beast in which 'her only asset is her sexuality'.\\nA lesson plan which circulated online in 2018\u00a0by a teacher in England for lessons such as RE and Citizenship taught pupils aged 11-16:\u00a0'The Beast does not attack Belle but the threat of physical violence is present.'\\nReferencing the movie adaptation of the story, the plan goes on:\u00a0'The movie says if a woman is pretty and sweet natured she can change an abusive man into a kind and gentle man.\\n'In other words, it is the woman's fault if her man abuses her.

Every morning I would find that half a dozen acts of idiocy had taken place while I\u2019d slept.\\nI\u2019d go to bed reeling from the claim that country walks were racist and wake up to the glad tidings that cyclists wanted to be included in the ever-lengthening queue of those who may be eligible for hate crime status.\\nAs the insanity picked up velocity, one cultural artefact after another went up in flames, lest it offend somebody.\\nFirst they came for our TV memories. Fawlty Towers (don\u2019t mention the war), the Dukes Of Hazzard (a car decorated with a Confederate flag) and Songs Of Praise (whose producer likened people singing Rule Britannia to neo-Nazis celebrating gas chambers).\\nThen they came for cartoons. On Disney\u2019s streaming service, classics such as Dumbo, Peter Pan, Lady And The Tramp and The Jungle Book were preceded by the dire warning: \u2018This programme includes negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures. These stereotypes were wrong then and are wrong now.\u2019\\nThey came for the museums. The Natural History Museum\u2019s Charles Darwin collection was targeted because he had voyaged to the Galapagos Islands on \u2018colonialist scientific expeditions\u2019.\\nAnd they came for the old houses. The National Trust published a list of nearly 100 of its properties which it claimed had links to slavery and colonialism.\\nThey came for full stops, which apparently intimidate young people when used in social-media communication as they are interpreted as a sign of anger and insincerity.\\nThey even came for rainbows, when a psychologist complained: \u2018Not long after lockdown was imposed, I was pleasantly surprised to see a rainbow flag on my drive home from work.\\n'However, as I saw more rainbow flags, I quickly realised these were not intended as support for the LGBTQ+ community, but rather as support for the NHS. I felt saddened, and disappointed.\u2019\\nBut it was racism \u2013 which is without doubt one of the greatest evils of the Earth \u2013 that became the big one in the past year or so, suddenly detected in all sorts of places you could never have imagined.\\nMaster bedrooms were racist (master has slavery connotations). Chess was racist (because white always goes first). Brunch was racist, according to the actor Alan Cumming, because it reeks of \u2018white privilege\u2019.\\nSherlock Holmes was racist, the countryside was racist, fried chicken was racist, the anti-racist film In The Heat Of The Night was racist.\\nHawaiian shirts, camping, gardening, biking, hiking, jogging, mathematics, trees, botany, libraries, roads, lawns, soap, craft beers, peanut butter, dieting, wine, spelling, Thomas The Tank Engine, robots, interior design, surfing, hockey, the Smurfs \u2013 ALL RACIST!\\nSo in the interests of harmony and time saving, shall we just cut to the chase and ban everything: every book, film and TV show, reinstating each one only when a global referendum has established that no one in the world is offended by them?\\nI started writing this book during lockdown, when we were all reassessing what was really important to us. At first I wondered if I should even write it at all, given that we were \u2018all in it together\u2019. Luckily, the ceaseless whining and ill-will from Wokers at a time when everyday people proved to be humdrum heroes and the Conservative government was acting like Robin Hood gave me renewed purpose.\\nFor instance, I heard a right-on halfwit on the radio complaining that in dangerous days like these, we should have more diversity in the Cabinet if it was to be credible, \u2018because when everyone looks the same, it doesn\u2019t give people confidence in the Government\u2019.\\nThis would be the Cabinet in which the four main offices of state were occupied by a woman of Gujarati-East African extraction, a man of Punjabi-East African extraction, a man of Eastern European Jewish extraction and a bouncing bumptious blond man whose great-grandfather was the Turkish politician Ali Kemal who served under the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire.\\nDid the radio halfwit perhaps believe that diversity was being ill served by there being too few Anglo-Saxons in the Cabinet?\\nOf course not. She was merely appalled by the wrong type of diversity \u2013 one which had come about through effort and merit rather than quotas and patronage.\\nWhy, even during the greatest threat to the human race in living memory, were the Woke still such nitpicking naysayers?\\nIT had all been going so well. Women, homosexuals and ethnic minorities \u2013 in the West \u2013 seemed to be moving towards parity with the people who had always presumed to know better, ie white men.\\nA female British Prime Minister in 1979, a black American President in 2008, more gays than you could shake a rainbow-striped stick at on primetime TV \u2013 all pulling down the barriers one block at a time.\\nAnd then Woke came along and it all went wrong.\\nLike Political Correctness before it, Wokeness started as an admirable aim and ended up as a despicable smugness, inhabited by people who need never tackle their own shortcomings while there are demonised others to unload upon.\\nYou\u2019ll have seen them everywhere: Wokers in fashion, publishing, universities, the BBC, the Labour Party, the Royal Family.\\nAnd though they think of themselves as the most enlightened group in any society, both their beliefs and the way they express them hark back to a darker time.\\nWokeness is the roar of the entitled mediocre, desperate to hold centre stage and terrified by any challenge to their flimsy sense of self \u2013 a temper tantrum with a socially concerned alibi.\\nThe word \u2018Woke\u2019 means anything other than the opposite of being asleep. But there is something creepy and smug about the word \u2013 indicating that one person is inherently better than others, without actually having to do anything to prove it.\\nBut it wasn\u2019t till the smuggest, most inactive people on Earth \u2013 privately educated and over-protected students \u2013 got their hands on it that the true folly of Woke was revealed in all its gory glory.\\nUniversities have now been refurbished as pity-party play-pens where feelings trump facts, as they do for infants.\\nThe Woke would be less objectionable if they lived up to their own pristine standards, but they fall woefully short.\\nIn an inversion of the psychiatrist Carl Jung\u2019s great saying \u2018You are what you do, not what you say you\u2019ll do\u2019, once you have identified as Woke you can get away with anything.\\nThus the Sussexes feel free to lecture others on climate change while happily flying about in private jets.\\nBut perhaps what I hate most about the Woke is the way they have done the dirty on feminism.\\nI found Margaret Thatcher fascinating, but I never voted for her. I\u2019d been brought up in a Communist household with such a hardcore Labour father that for much of my infancy I believed \u2018capitalist\u2019 literally to be a swear word.\\nMrs Thatcher was a rebel and just my kind \u2013 far more so than the stale, pale, male Labour leaders I mindlessly kept wasting my vote on because the patriarchy, in the shape of my own dear pa, had told me it was the proper thing to do.\\nThere\u2019s a lovely photograph of the punk singer Poly Styrene, the novelist Jackie Collins and the campaigner Mary Whitehouse attending the Women of the Year lunch shortly after Mrs Thatcher\u2019s first Election victory in 1979, all smiling at each other. It says something good about the late 20th Century that such different women were happy to be seen together.\\nI wonder whether this could happen now?\\nRegrettably, I rather think that, instead, we\u2019d have some bloke referring to himself as \u2018They\u2019 centre stage and the women shooed off to the sidelines.\\nThat\u2019s certainly what\u2019s happened in the Labour Party.\\nWhat were they doing while Mrs Thatcher was encouraging girls to believe they could lead the country?\\nThey were electing a selection of dinosaur dudes as leader \u2013 duds as disparate as James Callaghan and Michael Foot \u2013 while ignoring the talent, such as that of Harriet Harman, in their ranks.\\nWith almost three decades on the front bench, twice acting deputy leader and the first Labour woman to feature at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, Harman is the definitive Nearly Woman \u2013 as are all capable Labour women, trapped in a party which, having signed up to the brotherhood of man, seems quite happy to ride roughshod over their sisters.\\nThat the Tories were not so inclined became obvious with their election of Theresa May as both party leader and PM in 2016 \u2013 just a year after Labour chose another man to lead them \u2013 a man who appeared as much a fan of misogyny as any other weirdy beardy, from friendly neighbourhood mosque to local real ale society.\\nJeremy Corbyn may have named the women\u2019s rights reformer Mary Wollstonecraft as his hero, but talk is cheap.\\nNot only have the Conservatives had two female leaders while Labour have achieved the grand total of zero, but as the Labour MP Jess Phillips told me: \u2018People on the Left are champions of sex equality until they see that some of their power is being taken away from them \u2013 whereas the Tories willingly gave it over.\u2019\\nMany Labour supporters breathed a sigh of relief when Corbyn was replaced by Sir Keir Starmer.\\nBut I could hardly have been more underwhelmed. For me, my party jumped the shark when the female leadership candidates were asked their positions on the Gender Recognition Act and each one said that they were fine with male-bodied rapists being put into female prisons.\\nIn this age of safe spaces for all, the spaces where women are most vulnerable \u2013 toilets, jails, women\u2019s refuges \u2013 were suddenly flung open to any rapacious trucker who had decided that he felt like a woman.\\nWhen Woman\u2019s Place UK \u2013 a long-standing feminist group \u2013 pointed out that sex is a protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010, they were reviled as a \u2018trans-exclusionist hate group\u2019 and told that their supporters would be expelled from the Labour Party.\\nLabour leadership and deputy leadership candidates as apparently disparate as Lisa Nandy, Rebecca Long Bailey, Emily Thornberry, Angela Rayner and Rosena Allin-Khan all queued up to witch-hunt their fellow women.\\nThe party which, in its infancy, had rejected the Suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst as a member on the grounds of her sex, was right back where it started \u2013 only this time it was old enough to know better.\\nBetween 2017 and 2019 I had a rather embarrassing crush on Meghan Markle.\\n\u2018Meghan has never waited soppily for some prince to rescue her,\u2019 I wrote in one magazine. \u2018In fact, it seems far likelier that it is she who will rescue the prince.\u2019\\nCRINGE! as the youngsters say. Thankfully, I was swiftly thoroughly disillusioned.\\n\u2018Harry and Meghan took four private jets in 11 days after a summer of lecturing us about climate change; this followed shortly after the Prince\u2019s jaunt to the Google climate change summit where he is also thought to have taken a helicopter, as he habitually uses them to fly short distances whereas the Queen makes do with a train,\u2019 I scribbled in another article.\\n\u2018Having Elton John rush in to defend them didn\u2019t help, but only further established that the Sussexes saw themselves as international stars rather than one nation\u2019s public servants.\u2019\\nShortly after hearing that Meghan planned to semi-retire from Royal duties in order to spend more time with her merchandising, I coined the phrase the \u2018Grabdication\u2019 (grabbing the limelight, grabbing the status, grabbing the cash) and my rehabilitation was complete.\\nThe Grabdication was another Woke event, along with the Gender Recognition Act and the Remoaner refusal to accept Brexit, which while appearing to be liberal was actually the opposite.\\nThe Grabdication told peasants that princes may do as they wish with no regard to public opinion; the Gender Recognition Act that men may do as they wish with no regard for the opinion of women; and a proposed second vote on Brexit that the ruling class may do as they wish and ignore the voice of the people.\\nWe\u2019d been on this \u2018do-as-I-say- not-as-I-fly\u2019 bumpy ride before, of course; Prince Harry\u2019s father, Prince Charles (perhaps the grandaddy of Woke, with his mutterings on this and that), has long exemplified my observation: \u2018It\u2019s no wonder that the wealthy are friends of the Earth \u2013 it\u2019s been a damn good friend to them.\u2019\\nThe idea of a pre-industrial Eden \u2013 the rich man in his castle, the poor man at his gate \u2013 has fuelled the righteous fury of aristocrats against capitalism since the late 1960s.\\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the Green Party was guided by the rather charming and telegenic Sir Jonathon Espie Porritt, 2nd Baronet and Old Etonian.\\nAnother Old Etonian, Zac Goldsmith \u2013 or Baron Goldsmith of Richmond Park, as his friends call him \u2013 proved with his extensive championing of ecology issues over the past two decades that super-rich and sexy Conservative MPs could be as rabidly pro-planet and anti-humanity as any smelly old unelectable loony.\\nThe well-born travelling the world in order to gather evidence as to why the humbly born should stay at home and treat themselves to a lovely staycation in Slough has thus become something of a blueprint.\\nBut none of these \u2018Green\u2019 hypocrites could hold a hand-poured soy wax vegan Highgrove candle to their kingpin, the Prince of Wales, who in 2007 flew first class to America \u2013 with an entourage of 20 people \u2013 to collect an environmental award.\\nAnd then, two years later, used a private jet on an \u2018environmental\u2019 tour of South America, costing approximately \u00a3300,000 for a 16,000-mile trip.\\nSay what you like about Prince Harry\u2019s parentage, in this department he certainly seems to be a chip off the old blockhead.\\nPrince Charles has an actress chum, too. Emma Thompson (the grandmother of Woke) flew in first class from Los Angeles to London to join the Extinction Rebellion protests of spring 2019 \u2013 a 5,456-mile transatlantic flight that stomped out a three-ton carbon footprint.\\nExtinction Rebellion, which demands that flights be used only in emergencies, simpered that Dame Emma\u2019s jaunt was \u2018an unfortunate cost in our bigger battle to save the planet\u2019.\\nIn short, Green \u2013 like Wokeness itself \u2013 is the first socio-political movement in which every mover and shaker ranges from well-off to filthy rich.\\nHearing the over-privileged halfwits of Extinction Rebellion talk about economic growth as if it were child abuse, you can sense real contempt towards people who believe that working at a job in order to make money and pay the taxes which keep society civil is a desirable thing to do.\\nIt\u2019s a bit rich seeing Woke Blokes such as Jon Snow smirking while saying he\u2019s \u2018never seen so many white people in one place\u2019 at a Brexit rally, when Extinction Rebellion are so white they make the Last Night Of The Proms look like Jamaica\u2019s Reggae Sunsplash festival.\\nEcology is politics for people who don\u2019t like people and are miffed that the masses are now free to travel cheaply, rather than being hooked up to a plough or doing laundry in a creek.\\nDuring Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in 2016, it was a common Woke boast by celebs \u2013 from Snoop Dogg to Barbra Streisand \u2013 that they would leave the US in protest if he

behind her.\\nShe didn\u2019t want to be out of the limelight \u2013 she just wanted a different kind of limelight.\\nThe American-born, London-based Royal commentator Ashley Pearson provided a piquant comment which certainly rang true, considering the peevishness which emanated from the couple as soon as the honeymoon was over: \u2018She had no idea how unglamorous it really is to be a

celebrity and Wokeness reached its shining peak, and it was briefly Camelot for Meghan and Harry, the fraudulent monarchs of a fraudulent movement: the First Couple of Woke.\\nFrom the September 2019 issue of Vogue, edited by none other than Me-Again herself, to the moment they were revealed as the only people apart from Greta Garbo ever to move to Hollywood because they wanted to be left alone, they could do no wrong.\\nAnd then the Grabdication went bust, and was revealed as being as morally bankrupt as the celebrity and the Wokeness which had spawned it, with a whole nasty level of its own because the three belief systems had never been seen in the same place before.\\nThe Sussexes\u2019 more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger faces stopped selling magazines as we shied away from yet another showboating photo-op of them handing out food to the poor.\\nTheir popularity plummeted, with a YouGov poll showing that they were only marginally more popular than Princess Anne\u2019s corgi-killing dog Dotty.\\nNever mind \u2013 they\u2019ll have their multi-million-dollar Netflix deal to keep them warm until the Americans realise there\u2019s nothing special about them without the musty tinge

The two officers then lowered further down to remove the banner from view.\\nThe activists later reacted to having their banner removed by using duct tape to spell out 'Defund Meat' on the metal fascia of the building. Animal Rebellion supporters sat on the pavement cheered as the makeshift message was completed, while more than a dozen police stood below with two technical advisors from the fire brigade.\\nAnimal Rebellion - which, like Insulate Britain, is an offshoot from the bigger Extinction Rebellion group - organised today's protest ahead of the United Nations climate change summit in Glasgow which starts this Sunday.\\nThe group, which was founded in July 2019, said it would continue to take action until the Government 'defunds meat and subsidises a plant-based transition' \u2013 and the protesters threatened to stay on the building 'for weeks'.\\nPolice, firefighters and paramedics were all at the scene shortly after the demonstration began in the dark, and the protesters \u2013 who were all wearing climbing equipment - then dropped a banner over the entrance. The entrance was cordoned off, with a small group of activists on the ground watching their fellow protesters who lit red flares.\\nBut a government official said police and fire crews were 'just stood watching', adding: 'I've never seen anything like it. Just because they have a banner saying ''Go Vegan'' doesn't mean they don't have malicious intent.'\\nAnother miffed government official said of the protest: 'Not sure them gluing themselves to an empty building responsible for policing and national security is going to make their case for the world to become vegan.'\\nIt comes as Ministers continue to raise frustrations over civil servants not returning to offices, with Whitehall officials under pressure to spend fewer days working from home to help London recover after the pandemic.\\nOne of the activists, who gave his name as James, said he was prepared to stay roped to the building 'for weeks'. He added that he and the others had hammocks that they would use to sleep in overnight and prolong the protest.\\nJames, 24, a researcher, told MailOnline: 'We are not moving until we have some response from the Government with a meaningful conversation about the end of meat and dairy farming and a plant based food system.\\n'We all have hammocks to sleep in and will be here indefinitely \u2013 unless the police remove us by force. It could be days or weeks. The fire brigade came by this morning and checked that we were all safe and left.\\nScotland Yard responded today to criticism that is officers were 'just stood watching' the protesters. Here is the force's full statement:\\n'We've seen a number of comments and questions around our response to a demonstration on Marsham Street today, where four activists have scaled a building.\\n'Firstly, we are working as quickly as possible to remove those who have climbed the building in the safest way. Working from height is incredibly complex and can be dangerous. With height, comes risk.\\n'We have specialist teams who train for these scenarios, but we must allow those officers to make a number of detailed assessments before they attempt to remove activists.\\n'Our primary concern is the safety of everyone involved, our officers and those protesting. If there was a fall this could result in serious injury.\\n'Despite some comments, we cannot haphazardly rush in and pull people down. This puts our officers at risk and those at height. The claims that officers at the scene 'just stand watching' is not a fair reflection of events.\\n'The risks involved mean we must take careful precautions which will allow the safe removal of those at height. We know and appreciate this takes time, but this is necessary.\\n'Our assessment at Marsham Street continues. Our specialist units are on scene and it is important we give them the time to make assessments and develop a safe plan. We will share further updates in due course.'\\n'The only way the police will be able to move us is by bringing in a hoist and taking us down. We fully expect to be arrested.'\\nJames, from London, said all four of the activists were experienced rock climbers familiar with the safety equipment needed to secure themselves to the building.\\nSpeaking from his mobile phone, he added: 'It was quite strenuous and took two hours to get up here and secure the banner. We have taken all the necessary safety precautions and as well as the hammocks we have food provisions and sanitary means in place. We will stay here as long as it takes, and if that means days or weeks so be it. We are in a climate emergency and we have to take action now.'\\nAsked why he was being a public nuisance, James also told GB News today: 'We're not being a public nuisance, the UK Government are being a public nuisance by spending \u00a31.5billion of taxpayer money on subsidies on the meat and dairy industry.'\\nAsked how long he would stay up on the building, James added: 'We've been waiting for a change on climate change in the UK for decades now, and it's still not coming fast enough. We're prepared to stay here.\\n'We've got some hammocks and we're planning on getting comfortable until either our demands are met or we have a meaningful conversation with someone from Defra on how they're going to transition their subsidies away from these destructive industries to something a bit more sustainable, a bit more fair - ultimately, our only solution going forward which is plant-based alternatives over meat and dairy. So, basically, we'll see - as long as it takes, is the answer to that in short.'\\nActivist Claudia Penna Rojas said: 'We are here in the lead-up to Cop26 demanding that the Government takes drastic action by transitioning to a plant-based food system as the science tells us we need to.'\\nShe acknowledged that 'not everyone will be willing to give up meat immediately' but 'what we are asking is for the Government to be responsible, to stop subsidising animal agriculture - dairy, meat - and begin subsidising more ethical, sustainable ways of farming'.\\nThe large yellow sign read: 'Cop: Invest in a plant-based future', while another activist stood in front of the building holding a placard saying: 'Defund meat'.\\nThey told a Sky News reporter at the scene: 'Ahead of Cop26 we are calling for - no, demanding - that the world wake up and switch to a fully plant-based diet.'\\nA Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Police were called at 6.09am following reports that a number of protesters had scaled a government building in Marsham Street.\\nInsulate Britain today urged drivers not to use the M25 as they threatened to bring chaos to the motorway once again tomorrow with a series of road blockades.\\nThe environmental campaigners also asked police to refuse to arrest them and warned their 'non-violent civil resistance' will restart on the road from 7am tomorrow.\\nInsulate Britain added that if motorists do still choose to use the M25 tomorrow then their speed should be 'reduced to 20 mph to minimise the risk of accidents'.\\nIt comes after the London-based activists were effectively banned from all major roads in England yesterday following a landmark High Court ruling.\\nThe protesters have brought chaos to motorways and A roads over the last six weeks with hundreds of arrests made \u2013 but the Metropolitan Police has still charged no one.\\nIn their latest demonstration, the eco-zealots brought parts of London to a standstill once again yesterday - several of them glueing their hands, feet or faces to roads.\\n'Officers are on scene with the London Fire Brigade. There have been no arrests at this time.' The force said on Twitter that it was 'engaging with the protestors'.\\nIn a further statement responding to criticism, a Scotland Yard spokesman added: 'We've seen a number of comments and questions around our response to a demonstration on Marsham Street today, where four activists have scaled a building.\\n'Firstly, we are working as quickly as possible to remove those who have climbed the building in the safest way.

Our specialist units are on scene and it is important we give them the time to make assessments and develop a safe plan.\\n'We will share further updates in due course.'\\nThe activists defied calls from police and fire crews to climb down five hours into their protest.\\nUnlike the eco mob from Insulate Britain who have caused chaos on roads, the protestors caused little disruption with only the road outside the offices of the Home Office closed to traffic.\\nSurrounding roads by Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament were unaffected by the stunt.\\nFive fire engines were on standby in the road but no attempt was being made to coax the protestors down as they sat smiling on the outside metal structure of the building.\\nWorkers were prevented from going through the main doors of the building as they were taped off by a police cordon but were still able to access the office via other entrances.\\nHalf a dozen other Animal Rebellion protestors stood behind a police cordon. Cartons of almond milk could be seen among their provisions.\\nWhile Insulate Britain protestors were mostly retired, the Animal Rebellion activists were in their 20s and 30s.\\nAnimal Rebellion spokesman Haley McDonald-Eckersall said the group wanted to Government to stop subsiding meat and dairy farmers and instead switch all production to plant based foods.\\nShe said the group recently held a march where 7,000 people turned up to show their support.\\nMs McDonald-Eckersall said: 'We have to move forward with a more sustainable method of food production and we have to have it implemented now. This is all tied to the climate emergency and the Government has to sit up and listen.\\n'The money that is spent on subsidising meat and dairy farmers should be spent on sustainable plant-based foods.'\\nAs well as eradicating all meat and dairy cows the eco-group want to stop all fishing with the UK becoming a nation of vegetarians and vegans.\\nMs McDonald-Eckersall said the group \u2013 which last staged a demonstration at a McDonald's restaurant in Cornwall during the G7 conference - would continue with their stunts and said members would be heading to Glasgow for the Cop26 conference where world leaders will set out their aims for tackling climate change.\\nShe added: 'We have to get our message across to the leaders at the Cop26 conference. There will be other actions like this one. We are all prepared to go to jail if need be.\\nFire crews kept a close eye of the activists who had secured themselves to the building with rope and wore orange safety helmets. Passers-by were less than impressed with the demo which bean at 6.30am.\\n'I would turn the fire hose on them to get them off,' said an office worker who was picking up coffee from a nearby cafe.\\n'What right to they have to tell me what I can and cannot eat. Its all about personal choice, but like that lot who sit in the road they do not want that for people.'\\nAn Animal Rebellion spokesman tweeted: 'Animal Rebellion protestors have scaled Defra, demanding government support for a plant-based food system at Cop26.\\n'The protestors have said that they will take action until the government defunds meat and subsidises a plant-based transition.\\n'Meat and dairy is one of the leading producers of greenhouse gases and causes 90 per cent of Amazon deforestation.\\n'World leaders at cannot talk about meeting the Paris climate targets and securing global net zero without addressing that our food system is destroying our planet.'\\nThe spokesman added: 'We'll be posting updates as the day unfolds. Stay tuned... #COP26 #EnoughCopOuts #PlantBasedFuture.'\\nIn response to the tweets, some social media users supported the group's actions, saying 'Yaaaaaaaaas!' and 'Go you guys! The activism that needs to happen.'\\nBut one said: 'I am going to eat meat for all three meals today, despite usually aiming to go meat free for at least two. This is purely because I find your methods completely odious.'\\nAnd another added: 'I don't want to eat a plant based alternative to meat. Who do these people think they are? It's personal choice what people choose to eat.'\\nOthers said: 'Nice leather boots they are wearing', and 'Stand for election. Otherwise the public is entitled to laugh at you.'\\nIt comes after Insulate Britain activists were effectively banned from all major roads in England yesterday following a landmark High Court ruling.\\nThe eco-zealots, also linked to XR, brought parts of London to a standstill once again yesterday \u2013 several of them superglueing their hands, feet or faces to roads.\\nJudges approved the application of an injunction against protesting on 4,300 miles of motorways and major A-roads, also known as the Strategic Road Network.\\nAnyone breaking it faces unlimited fines or jail for contempt of court. Yesterday's blockades \u2013 the first in ten days by the group \u2013 triggered more fury from Londoners.\\nAlso yesterday, Boris Johnson admitted the Cop26 climate conference could end in failure as it emerged the world has not met a key funding deadline.\\nThe Prime Minister warned that it was 'touch and go' whether key goals would be met at the UN summit to tackle global warming.\\nHe admitted 'we might not get the agreements we need' due to major world leaders, including China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin, not attending the summit.", "image": [["Activists from Animal Rebellion

People are right to feel angry and upset.\\n'Johnson's failure to act has left us with petrol queues, energy companies going bust, offshore workers unemployed for months on end, and a deepening climate crisis.\\n'Johnson must stop Cambo, and instead prioritise a just transition to renewable energy to protect consumers, workers and the climate from future shocks. If he doesn't, he will be remembered as a monumental climate failure.'\\nThe protest comes just weeks before the UK hosts a global climate change conference in Scotland.\\nIt also comes as the UK faces a mounting gas which will see annual bills rise for all Britons in the coming year by up to \u00a31,000 while energy-hungry factories say they may have to reduce hours or shut down completely.\\nThere are still shortages of petrol in London and the south-east almost three weeks into the crisis while there are gaps on shelves amid warnings that Christmas foods and gifts could be in short supply due to a lack of HGV drivers and problems with the global supply chain.\\nKwasi Kwarteng told Sky News he was 'constantly' in conversation with the Treasury to see what support can be given to manufacturers and energy firms.\\nBut a Treasury source hit back, saying: 'This is not the first time the [Business] Secretary has made things up in interviews. To be crystal clear, the Treasury are not involved in any talks.'\\nFirms have slammed ministers for failing to help protect companies from an energy price shock that could see factories shutting down within weeks.\\nHeavy-industry leaders, covering steel, brick manufacturing, chemicals, ceramics and papers, are furious at the inaction.\\nUK Steel director general Gareth Stace warned of possible 'long-term damage' to the industry. He said: 'Currently, UK steel-makers face energy prices five times higher than the average of last year, in addition to remarkable price volatility.\\n'As such, longer and more frequent pauses in production are becoming a fact of life. These circumstances are simply not sustainable for the sector. We urge the Government to take action, as has been done in Italy and Portugal, to support the sector.'\\nDr Laura Cohen, chief executive of the British Ceramic Confederation, said: 'I am really concerned that the Secretary of State hasn't understood the urgency of what we're asking for.\\n'We need practical gas emergency measures that keep enough gas available and our factories going when supplies get tight.'\\nMeanwhile, Boris Johnson also came under scrutiny today for jetting off to Marbella as the crisis continues.\\nBusiness leaders have insisted the PM should be 'banging ministerial heads together' over the response to the looming 'winter of discontent' instead of sunning himself at a \u00a325,000-a-week private estate near Marbella.\\nWithin hours of Mr Johnson departing chaos broke out in Whitehall over whether there would be a rapid bailout to help struggling firms survive the energy crisis.\\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said he was looking to see whether 'existing support' was 'sufficient' despite warnings that some factories could shut in weeks. But in an extraordinary briefing war, the Treasury, which is run by Chancellor Rishi Sunak, accused him of 'making things up' by claiming its departments were in talks about helping industry.\\nTory MP Andrew Percy - who has a steel works in his Yorkshire constituency - urged ministers to 'grow a pair' and step in.\\n'If the government doesn't intervene here then it will amount to an abandonment of the north and midlands, where heavy industry and manufacturing is primarily located,' he told the Times.\\nThere are also claims the the Conservative Steel Caucus, which includes around a dozen Tory MPs with industrial seats, has been making increasingly desperate representations behind the scenes.\\nMr Stace has today called on the Prime Minister to 'bang ministerial heads together' to avoid an industry crisis hitting his sector.\u00a0 He told LBC: 'This is a critical time. The Business Secretary has also said it's a critical situation, and therefore why is Government just sitting on its hands and doing absolutely nothing at the moment?\\n'From my point of view, today, with the reported Government infighting between the Treasury and BEIS, the Prime Minister now needs to bang ministerial heads together, take control and remember that if he does nothing, then his levelling-up ambition will be left in tatters.'\\nAndrew Percy, the Conservative MP for Brigg and Goole whose constituency contains the gigantic Scunthorpe steelworks, called on the government to 'grow a pair' and intervene to save jobs.\\nHe told The Times: 'Ministers have a choice. They can bury their heads in the sand and pretend they have no responsibility, or they can grow a pair and accept that a lot of the problems we have at the moment with energy costs in the UK are a consequence of decisions taken by governments in this country. Whether it's labour shortages, whether it's energy costs, we seem to be saying: 'Well, industry needs to go away and sort that out. It's not for us'.'\\nBut defending the PM's holiday Security Minister Damian Hinds said: 'What is important for the rest of us actually, for the whole country, is that the Prime Minister does get to have some family time, does get to have a break'.", "image": [["Police officers stand guard as Greenpeace activists stage a sit-in after installing an oil-splattered statue of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/12/49022935-10080029-image-a-4_1633952927977.jpg"], ["A plaque on the statue reads: 'Cambo oilfield: Boris Johnson's monumental climate failure'", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/12/49022939-10080029-image-a-5_1633952950772.jpg"], ["Greenpeace says it is protesting against the pending approval of the new oilfield in Cambo, off the coast of the Shetland Islands", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/12/49022943-10080029-image-a-6_1633952959905.jpg"], ["Dampaigners from Greenpeace demonstrate at Downing Street against the Cambo oil field off the west coast of Shetland", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/12/49023027-10080029-image-a-10_1633953040936.jpg"], ["The protest comes just weeks before the UK hosts a global climate change conference in Scotland", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/12/49023013-10080029-image-a-9_1633953036632.jpg"], ["Police officers detach an oil barrel from a Greenpeace climate activist during the protest", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/12/49023009-10080029-image-a-8_1633953030933.jpg"], ["Police officers detain a Greenpeace climate activist after today's protest at Downing Street", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/12/49023005-10080029-image-a-7_1633953028770.jpg"], ["Police officers cutting an oil barrel as campaigners from Greenpeace protest outside Downing Street", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/12/49023025-10080029-image-a-11_1633953052342.jpg"], ["Boris Johnson and his pregnant wife Carrie are taking a foreign break at a \u00a325,000-a-week Marbella hideaway owned by the Prime Minister's wife's close friend and Tory peer Zac Goldsmith", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/12/48997249-10080029-Boris_Johnson_and_his_pregnant_wife_Carrie_are_taking_a_foreign_-a-15_1633953061155.jpg"], ["Boris Johnson is sunning himself in Spain as Britain is in the midst of energy, petrol and supply chain crises", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/14/49016813-10080029-Boris_Johnson_is_sunning_himself_in_Spain_as_Britain_is_in_the_m-a-26_1633958227890.jpg"]], "author": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "date": "2021-10-11"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-10062319/Extinction-Rebellion-protestor-storms-Louis-Vuittons-Paris-Fashion-Week-show.html": {"title": "Extinction Rebellion protestor is tackled to the ground after storming Louis Vuitton's Paris Fashion Week show with 'overconsumption = extinction' sign", "subtitle": "Activist from Amis de la Terre France [Friends of the Earth] campaign group carried a banner reading 'Overconsumption = extinction' to Louis Vuitton show.

The point is, what are they doing on the farm of somebody who preaches about green energy and the environment?\\n'The fact that it's an organic farm makes it even more ludicrous. He's a prize hypocrite - what he preaches and what he does are two different things. There are diesel vehicles on his farm leaving a carbon footprint and for that to be allowed is a disgrace.'\\nOrganic farmer Hallam, who claims that he lost his business because of severe weather, set up Insulate Britain (IB) when he caused a rift within XR by telling a German newspaper the Holocaust was 'just another f***ery in human history'.\\nHe later said his remark was taken out of context.\\nHallam, 55, provoked further outrage this week after insisting that he would block an ambulance with a dying patient inside in order to continue eco-protests by Insulate Britain, which have wreaked havoc on roads and motorways in recent weeks.\\nThe extraordinary admission, made during an interview with the Unbreak the Planet podcast, came after a tearful woman was filmed urging Insulate Britain protestors to move so she could get her 81-year-old mother to the hospital.\\nBut asked what he would have done in that situation, replied in a steely tone: 'I'd stay there'.\\nAnother neighbour fumed: 'While people's lives are being disrupted from the protests by Hallam's group, there are two huge vehicles on his farm damaging the environment. You couldn't make it up.\\n'He's telling us what we should all be doing but isn't doing it himself.'\\nIn 2019, Hallam was cleared by a jury of all charges relating to a protest against fossil fuels.\\nHe did not deny criminal damage worth \u00a37,000 after spraying the walls of Kings College with the words 'divest from oil and gas' in protest against the institution's fossil fuel investments.\\nIronically, all six vehicles seen on Hallam's farm would not be allowed to enter London's expanded Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) unless they pay \u00a312.50 each.\\nThe zone which encompasses all areas within the North and South Circular Road, comes into force at the end of this month and charges drivers to enter if their vehicle does not meet certain emissions standards.\\nIn a further twist, it has also been revealed that Hallam's farmhouse was described as 'poorly insulated' in an official energy performance certificate.\\nThe 2,000 sq. ft property was given the lowest possible energy rating on the certificate.

Home slaughter does not take place in an approved slaughterhouse.\\nBut you must adhere to the legal requirements set out in the home slaughter of livestock guide England and Wales.\\nIt is illegal for meat from home-slaughtered animals to be sold on.\\nWhat are the rules on culling livestock?\\nFarmers are allowed to humanely slaughter livestock at home if it is to protect their welfare.\\nIt is illegal to sell meat that has not been slaughtered and health marked in a licensed abattoir.\\nThere are two statutes relating to the killing of animals outside of a licensed slaughter premises.\\nThese are The Protection of Animals Act 2006 and EC Regulation 1099/2009 on the protection of animals at the time of killing, implemented in the UK by The Welfare of Animals at the Time of Killing Regulations.\\nHow can the animal be killed?\\nTwo methods can be employed to slaughter on-farm; free bullet weapons (rifles, shotguns and humane killers) or captive-bolt stunning followed by bleeding.\\nFollowing a change in the firearms legislation in 1998, the captive-bolt is no longer classed as a firearm so does not require a firearm certificate.\\nFirearms can be suitable weapons, but a valid firearm certificate is required stating the species you intend to use it for.\\nDefra's code of practice for the welfare of pigs says the farm needs to have a heath and welfare plan to say who will kill the animals as well as a contingency plan if said person is not around.\\nIt says when killing a farm animal it must be done humanely using a method which makes them unconscious until death.\\nThe Human Slaughter Association says firearms are often 'the quickest and most effective methods of humane killing of livestock'.\\nThe barrel of the gun has to be in close quarters of the animal's head - 25cm - and it must fire\u00a0single bullets or shot-charges to kill the animal immediately.\\nWhere a pig has to be killed in an emergency then any method of killing is allowed as long as the animal is spared any avoidable pain, distress and suffering and is killed as soon as possible.\\nBut a trained person such as a vet must check there is no sign of life.\\nAfter a pig's death or killing, the carcass must be disposed of quickly and the death recorded.\\n600 pigs have been slaughtered and more of their piglets have been euthanised as the huge cull of pigs in Britain began today with farmers blaming a shortage of butchers and HGV drivers to transport animals to abattoirs.\\nBoris Johnson has said the mass slaughter of pigs has 'not yet taken place' but farmers wearing 'save our bacon' T-shirts who gathered to protest outside Tory Conference in Manchester say different.\\nThey said in the past two days hundreds of pigs have been culled by either being shot with a bolt gun or given a lethal injection by a vet and then either burnt or buried.\\nThe National Pig Association (NPA) has revealed that members in East Anglia have told them that the mass slaughter has started because they can't get into abattoirs - with 600 pigs now killed in the region - and piglets have also been euthanised because they will have nowhere to house them on backed up farms.\\nChief executive Zoe Davies said: 'This is just the beginning' as she and other experts predict that between 120,000 and 150,000 animals are under threat of being culled in the next ten days.\\nShe said: 'This is not excess supply, farmers have been contracted to grow these pigs, but the facilities are taking a quarter less than they agreed because they simply don't have the butchers. The Government has to help now because all the processors have tried very hard to recruit lately, wages have gone up exponentially over the last few months. The reality is that most people in the UK do not want to work in abattoirs and it doesn't matter how much you pay them.'\\nThe NPA wants the Government to offer 12-month visas to EU butchers to ease the crisis - but sources close to the Prime Minister told The Times he is determined not to relax immigration rules and believes that abattoirs must increase wages and also develop new tech and better facilities to solve the crisis themselves.\\nSpeaking in Manchester this morning, the Prime Minister\u00a0denied the ongoing supply chain chaos is a 'crisis' as he said the economy is 'creaking' back into life after Covid and moving to 'higher wages'.\\nFarmers\u00a0face having to shoot dead hundreds of thousands of pigs because\u00a0staff shortages at abattoirs have left too many packed in sheds on farms. A shortage of butchers means farmers are having to 'throw pigs in a skip' because they cannot be slaughtered and carved.\\nMeryl Ward, who runs a family farm in Lincolnshire, has accused the Government of 'madness' for not introducing Covid recovery visas to address labour shortages and letting food go bad.\\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'That retailer shelf is now being filled by foreign-imported pork that doesn't meet our welfare standards. My argument is that the industry doesn't have time, and that the solution requires Government to act, so the solution is Covid recovery visas, allowing skilled butchers and factory operatives into this country so we can get this supply chain working properly.'\\nWhen asked whether she will have to cull her pigs because of the lack of abattoir workers, Ms Ward said: 'The way we're managing at the moment is by stocking the pens as the pigs come in heavier. You can't do that for too long before that catches up with you. I know that farmers, already, regrettably, are having to start that kill.\\n'I don't think in living memory, or in any memory, we have ever had to cull perfectly healthy animals because of an intransigence of the Government that just refuses to allow what effectively is a very few skilled people into the country to resolve the issue. It just seems complete madness.\\n'I think the ethical issue comes first, really, it's a complete and utter waste. We have people in this country who are going to food banks, who can't afford to pay for food, who don't have enough food, and then we're going to throw perfectly good food in the bin.\\n'I don't understand that. I don't understand why a government would allow that to happen.'\\nYesterday crowds of pig farmers have gathered in Manchester to protest at the Conservative Party Conference.\\nThe farmers gathered after labour shortages have forced some in the sector slaughter livestock unnecessarily.\\nEmail martin.robinson@mailonline.co.uk\\nStephen Thompson, 60, a pig farmer in Sheffield, estimates that there is currently a 120,000 pig backlog.\\nStephen said: 'It's getting that bad, that there's won't be a pig industry by Christmas.\\n'They'll be no pigs in blankets, and no hams, if it's not sorted very soon.\\n'I was talking to a pig buyer this morning who thinks it's worse than when we had foot-in-mouth, and that was bad enough.\\n'I'm not having to cull yet but it will get very close very quickly.\\n'Prices are dropping, and pigs are being rolled across the industry all the time.\\n'It's getting very very very bad. The situation has been going on for 10 to 12 weeks, with 120,000 pigs in backlog currently.\\n'It's growing at about 10,000 pigs a week. I don't know what finally tripped it up, but COVID has been hitting plants and we've been struggling through.\\nRobert Shepherd, 58, a second generation farmer, faces culling 10,000 pigs in the coming weeks due to a drastic shortage of abattoir workers.\\nMr Shepherd usually sends 400 pigs to market a week but they are now backing up at his 2,000 acre Allenford Farm in Damerham, near Fordingbridge, Hants, due to the lack of butchers and HGV drivers to transport them.\\nHe said the staffing crisis has been the final straw following pressure put on his business due to Covid and he is now closing his pig farm that has been going since 1963.\\nAlthough too late for him, Mr Shepherd said it was crucial temporary visas were issued to foreign labour to allow British workers to be properly trained up, a process which can take 18 months.\\nHe said the government needs to 'pull their finger out and take the situation seriously' instead of being 'relaxed and flippant'.\\nWith up to 150,000 pigs facing culling nationwide, he said drastic action was required to 'prevent an apocalypse'.\\nThe British Meat Processing Association has revealed there is a 25 per cent shortage in abattoir staff due to a combination of Covid, immigration rules and Brexit.\\nMr Shepherd, who employs 14 workers, said one short term effect of the crisis is that Britain will have to import more meat from abroad to cope with demand, at the expense of British producers.\\nHe said: 'We have just had enough. This is the last straw.\\n'With all the pressures we've faced in the last 12 months we've got to a crisis point now.\\n'Covid started it 12 months ago and it has been exacerbated since they lifted the travel ban (so foreign workers could return home).\\n'We thought things would improve in the autumn but there is a huge lack of staff from foreign labour in the abattoirs. A lot of people have gone back to their own country.\\n'Every week more and more pigs back up at the farm and we are unable to get them to the abattoir to process.\\n'Unless something is done soon by the government and they actually pull their finger out and get serious many farms across the country will have to kill and burn their own pigs.\\n'We have 10,000 pigs here and we are doing everything we can to hang on but every day that passes the situation is getting worse, and in the worst case scenario they will need to be culled here.\\n'The government need to open their eyes to the situation and stop being so relaxed and flippant.\\n'They need to realise there is a real issue rather than bury their head in the sand as we head for an apocalypse.\\n'They could introduce temporary visas to foreign labour which the industry has been asking for for days and days.\\n'They could do the job while we get our own people trained up and the situation could easily be managed, but they've only issued a few visas until December 24 which will not attract people.\\n'We understand that things move on and have to develop but we have to do it in an orderly fashion and not have the rug pulled from underneath us.\\n'It is a very saddening and shocking situation. We will continue the arable side of our business but we can't hang on for things to improve on the pig side.'\\n\\n'There's a lack of butchers, and a lack of transport, and everything's come together at once to trip it up.'\\nNick Allen, from the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA), told the BBC that abattoirs are unable to process pigs at the usual rate because of a shortage of worker.\\nThis means live animals are mounting up on farms and some farmers were 'quietly starting to cull.'\\nPigs are also being killed because once they grow too big, the carcass will no longer fit into supermarket packets so retailers will not buy the meat from farms.\\nThe BMPA warned there was a shortage of some 10,000 trained butchers that could lead to problems this Christmas.\\nOne farmer said he had already been forced to slaughter hundreds of piglets due to labour shortages at his local abattoir.\\nThe Yorkshire stockman, who has not been named, took the drastic measure because slaughterhouses were not killing them fast enough.\\nA friend said he had been 'destroyed' by having to 'kill perfectly healthy, viable piglets' due to the backlog.\\nMinette Batters, president of the National Farmers Union, said a cull of up to 150,000 pigs was 'potentially a week, ten days away'.\\nShe told the BBC: 'I do not feel anybody can preside over a welfare cull of healthy livestock. I don't believe it has happened in the world before and it cannot happen now.'\\nMs Batters said she wants an urgent meeting with interior minister Priti Patel and immigration minister Kevin Foster. She said she has been trying to get a meeting with Patel for two years.\\nShe said 150,000 pigs could be culled in a week unless the government issues visas to foreign butchers.\\nMeanwhile the Yorkshire farmer's friend told the BBC: 'He had to kill perfectly healthy, viable piglets. It's desperate.\u00a0I've been producing for 26 years, and never faced the prospect of having to butcher pigs on my own farm before.'\\nAndrew Freemantle, a pig farmer in Exeter, Devon, said the backlog threatened farms because animals grow too big for slaughter, which hits how much they are worth.\\nHe said his farm has not been hit yet due to its smaller size, but warned the impact on other farmers.\\nHe told Devon Live: 'Across the industry, in Devon and the Westcountry, and the rest of the country, there are some really desperate people who are incredibly concerned about the welfare of their pigs, and their future as pig farmers.\\n'You can't carry on pig farming if you can't sell your pigs, if the pigs can't get into the abattoir and be processed. If you cannot sell the pigs on a regular basis, you pretty soon are ruined. There are a lot of farmers out there who are incredibly concerned that this situation will ruin them.'\\nMr\u00a0Mutimer from the National Pig Association echoed his woe, saying the UK is heading into an 'acute welfare disaster very quickly'.\\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'The problem in the industry has got very considerably worse over the last three weeks.\\n'We are within a couple of weeks of actually having to consider a mass cull of animals in this country.'\\nHe said pig farms of all sizes are running out of space to keep their animals, 'which is a real worry coming into winter'.\\nAsked what a culling situation would involve, he said: 'It involves either shooting pigs on farm, or taking them to an abattoir, killing the animals, and actually disposing them in the skip at the other end of the chain.\\n'So these animals won't go into the food chain. They will either be rendered, or if not, sent for incineration. So it's an absolute travesty.'\\nMr Mutimer said his pigs are usually around\u00a0253lbs when they go to slaughter, but are now getting up to around 309lbs.\\nHe added: 'The pens and the sheds and everything just weren't designed for animals of this size and we're really heading into an acute welfare disaster very quickly.'\\nThe shortage of labour in abattoirs is being blamed on the coronavirus pandemic and some point the finger at Brexit.\\nNick Allen, from the British Meat Processors Association, said the workforce in large abattoirs would normally be 10-15 per cent above average this time of year.\\nBut he said it is 15 per cent down, meaning pigs are mounting up at farms and some farmers were\u00a0'quietly starting to cull'.\u00a0They are forced into this because oversized pigs will not fit into supermarket packets.\\nMr Allen said: 'The main barrier is labour, with the change in the immigration policy. We are struggling to get butchers in particular, and it limits how fast you can run the plant.\\n'We were offering higher wages, but with the job market at the moment, it's not worked. We do need access to some non-UK labour.'\\nMeanwhile the British Meat Processors Association said 1,000 EU butchers is still 14,000 short of the 15,000 the country needs.\\nThis means businesses are focussing on keeping supermarkets stocked with simple cuts of meat such as bacon, steaks and chops.\\nA BMPA spokesman added: 'We really should have been producing Christmas food from about June or July onwards this year and so far we haven't, so there'll be shortages of party foods and things like pigs in blankets. Anything that is labour-intensive work could see shortages.'\\nDeputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has suggested offenders who have been given community sentences could be used to address the country's lack of HGV drivers amid continuing concerns about fuel shortages.\\nMr Raab, who was made Justice Secretary in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's recent ministerial reshuffle, has dismissed Labour's call for 100,000 migrant visas to be issued to provide sufficient drivers.\\nThe former Foreign Secretary said the move would leave the country reliant in the long term on labour coming from abroad, and instead suggested the gap could be filled in another way.\\n'We've been getting prisoners and offenders to do volunteering and unpaid work,' Mr Raab told The Spectator, in comments carried by The Times. 'Why not if there are shortages encourage them to do paid work where there's a benefit for the economy, benefit for society?\\n'If you give people skin in the game, give them something to lose, if you give them some hope, they're much less likely to re-offend.'\\nShoppers were told this week a raft of items - from turkey to beer - are under threat this Christmas amid the supply chain crisis.\\nBritish families may also struggle to find toys and sofas or get them delivered in time for the day.\\nMinisters have already said they cannot guarantee that there will not be shortages this Christmas with serious problems emerging in the meat sector.\\nThe cabinet is now said to be considering easing visa restrictions for up to 1,000 foreign butchers to avert the crisis.\\nBut the Times claims Priti Patel is against it and concerned they are being pushed by British industry to move back towards pre-Brexit freedom of movement.\\nA Home Office spokesman said: 'We are closely monitoring labour supply and working with sector leaders to understand how we can best ease particular pinch points. Similar challenges are being faced by other countries around the world.\\n'We want to see employers make long-term investments in the UK domestic workforce instead of relying on labour from abroad. Our Plan for Jobs is helping people across the country retrain, build new skills and get back into work.\\n'The Government encourages all sectors to make employment more attractive to UK domestic workers through offering training, careers options wage increases and investment.'\\nA spokesman for the government said that it was aware of the challenges the pig industry has faced in recent months.\\nThey said: 'We are keeping the market under close review and continuing to work closely with the sector to explore options to address the pressures the industry is currently facing.'\\nThe UK economy has been disrupted by several factors that have been bubbling away for months, including labour shortages, new immigration rules affecting HGV drivers and the lingering effects of the pandemic.\\nA spokesman for the Department For Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said that it was aware of labour shortages.\\nHe said: 'We understand the importance of seasonal labour and we are aware of the challenges that the pig industry has faced in recent months because of the Covid-19 pandemic and labour shortages, and Defra has been working closely with the pig and processing sectors during this time.\\n'We are keeping the market under close review and continuing to work closely with the sector to explore options to address the pressures industry is currently facing.'\\nRetail analyst Clive Black of of Shore Capital also warned turkeys could be replaced by nut roasts and people will ask 'what the hell is this' when they look at their plate on Christmas Day.\\nIt comes as drivers continue to queue for petrol amid concerns over the fuel supply chain, with industry experts fearing the problems could last for up to a month.\\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng admitted the fuel crisis could hit the festival season as he revealed the Government's reserve tanker fleet would be deployed.\\nMr Black told the\u00a0Times: 'I expect Christmas will be a nightmare for consumers. There will be food on supermarket shelves but there will be a distinct lack of choice.\\n'Shortages of labour have meant businesses have not laid down the same number of turkeys or planted the same number of crops and the HGV driver shortage is compounding the problem.'\\nThe Liverpool-based analyst added: 'A lot of people eating on Christmas Day will be asking 'What the hell is this?' It won't be traditional.\\n'They may be eating other meats and nut roasts.\u00a0Equally if the CO2 (carbon dioxide) problem does not settle, expect beer and carbonated soft drinks to be in short supply and a lot more expensive.'\\nHe said Christmas is 'going to be much pricier generally' and predicted that shipping issues could bring shortages of toys, bikes, sofas and electronic goods.\\nMr Black also blasted David Kennedy, the director-general for food at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, for being 'a disgrace' \u2013 and bemoaned what he described as a 'mismanagement of the economy'.\\nIt comes after Mr Kwarteng was asked if the fuel crisis situation would continue in the run up to Christmas, and said: 'I'm not guaranteeing anything; all I'm saying is that I think the situation is stabilising.'\\nOn Sunday, Kate Martin, chairman of the Traditional Farm-fresh Turkey Association (TFTA), warned Britain of a shortage of Christmas turkeys amid unprecedented demand and a farm labour shortage.\\nShe said while small farms that use local workers and sell directly to customers have been less affected, supermarket supplies are likely to be hit by a shortage of skilled European employees after Brexit.\\nThe TFTA represents around 40 farms producing free-range birds that meet the 'Golden' turkey quality assurance mark.\\nIt said some poultry farms have already had five times more orders this year than the same time in 2020.\\nTesco has already warned that a shortage of delivery drivers, which is causing empty shelves, could lead to panic buying in the lead-up to Christmas.\\nThe Government has announced a temporary visa scheme for 5,000 HGV drivers and 5,500 poultry workers brought in on three-month contracts to keep shelves stocked with turkeys and tackle fuel delivery difficulties.\\nDeputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab suggested offenders who have been given community sentences could be used to address the country's lack of HGV drivers amid continuing concerns about fuel shortages.\\nPanic buying sparked by concerns a lack of lorry drivers would prevent supplies reaching fuel pumps has brought long queues and pockets of aggression at petrol station forecourts over the last few days.\\nMr Raab, who was made Justice Secretary in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's recent ministerial reshuffle, has dismissed Labour's call for 100,000 migrant visas to be issued to provide sufficient drivers.\\nThe former Foreign Secretary said the move would leave the country reliant in the long term on labour coming from abroad, and instead suggested the gap could be filled in another way.\\nIt comes as motorists say there is still not enough fuel despite The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA)'s latest survey of its members finding just over one-in-four had run dry, down from more than a third on Tuesday.\\nMinisters said they expected the situation to improve further, with the first troops driving tankers expected to appear on the roads 'in the next couple of days'.\\nSome roads around London have become gridlocked as motorists hunted for stations that have fuel, with some carrying petrol cans, plastic jugs and water bottles to stock up, and there were even reports of violence in a handful of places.\\nPRA executive director Gordon Balmer said forecourt staff were being subjected to a 'high level' of physical and verbal abuse from frustrated motorists.\\nImminent changes to Britain's border rules could compound existing issues for freight entering the United Kingdom, a global road transport body said.\\nUnder new immigration rules which come into force tomorrow as part of post-Brexit measures to end freedom of movement, European Union ID cards will no longer be accepted as proof of identity.\\nInstead, EU nationals will need a passport to enter the United Kingdom.\\nThe International Road Transport Union (IRU) said that, despite working closely with the British government to inform hauliers, some drivers were likely to be caught out.\\nThe border rule change comes as Britain struggles with a shortage of tens of thousands of truck drivers which has led to severe supply chain issues, with fuel stations running empty in recent days after a spate of panic-buying.\\nRaluca Marian, IRU EU Advocacy Director, said: 'Aside from not seeing the real benefits of adding this layer of bureaucracy, and potentially affecting already difficult border freight flows post Brexit, we are also concerned that passports are generally more expensive than ID cards.\\n'UK authorities need to implement the change from Friday respecting professional drivers, without unnecessary bureaucracy or causing border or supply chain disruptions that would compound the serious supply chain issues already being seen in the UK due to driver shortages.'\\nThe Home Office, the government department that administers immigration policy, said ID cards are some of the 'most insecure and abused documents', and the haulage industry has had almost a year to prepare for the changes.\\nBritain left the EU's single market at the beginning of 2021, creating a full customs border with the bloc. But London did not immediately bring in import checks on goods entering Britain to give businesses time to adjust amid concern they would lead to delays.\\nBoris Johnson today denied supply chain chaos is a 'crisis' as he said the economy is 'creaking' back into life after Covid and moving to 'higher wages'.\\nIn a round of interviews at the Tory conference in Manchester, the PM insisted the country is at a 'turning point' as businesses are weaned off cheap labour after Brexit.\\nHe compared the disruption to a 'giant waking up', saying it was what you would expect of the global economy recovering and 'sucking in demand'.\\nAsked directly if he thought the situation was a 'crisis', he replied: 'No.'\\nBut he admitted that\u00a0Christmas might only be better from a 'low base' amid fears of ongoing shortages - after it was effectively cancelled during the pandemic last year.\\nAnd he conceded that the government's efforts to bring in more lorry drivers from abroad are having limited success, with just 127 having applied for emergency visas.\\nMr Johnson stressed that there is support for people facing huge pressure on energy bills and other living costs.\\nTensions have been rising between ministers and business over the crisis, with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss warning that firms will be to blame if the festive season is blighted by shortages and price rises.\\nOne Cabinet source told the Telegraph that companies have been 'drunk on cheap labour' and failed to plan for the changes.\\nIn other developments at the Tory conference builds towards the leaders' speech:\\nBoris Johnson\u00a0today warned Britons working from home that they risk being 'gossiped about' and missing out on 'stimulus and competition' unless they return to the office.\\nThe PM voiced growing confidence that Covid will not spark further lockdowns as he urged people to get 'back to work in the normal way'.\\nHe said the government was always 'humble in the face of nature' and recognised that 'a new variant or another pandemic could always hit us'.\\nBut he insisted: 'The data that I see at the moment is very clear that we are right to stick to Plan A, which is what we are on.'\\nHe said getting back to offices was 'essential for young people in particular'.\\n'If you are going to learn on the job, you can't just do it on Zoom,' he told LBC radio.\\n'You have got to be able to come in, you have got to know what everyone else is talking about \u2013 otherwise you are going to be gossiped about and you are going to lose out.'\\nMr Johnson's broadcast round including his first interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme in two years.\\nAnd it quickly descended into acrimony, with presenter Nick Robinson demanding that the PM 'stop talking' as he blustered through responses to questions.\\nA clearly stung Mr Johnson repeatedly referred to the rebuke, asking why he was there if he was not meant to be talking.\\nSpeaking on BBC Breakfast beforehand, the premier said:\u00a0'The supply chain problem is caused very largely by the strength of the economic recovery.\\n'What you will see is brilliant logistic experts in our supermarket chains, in our food processing industry, getting to grips with it, finding the staff that they need, we will help them in any way that we can.\\n'But the shortage is global.'\\nHe went on: 'What you can't do is go back to the old, failed model where you mainline low-wage, low-skilled labour \u2013 very often very hard-working, brave, wonderful people \u2013 who come in, working in conditions that frankly are pretty tough and we shouldn't be going back to that.'\\nThat had led to a situation where there was not investment in the industry and 'people had to urinate in bushes' because of the lack of facilities for drivers, he said.\\nMr Johnson told\u00a0LBC: 'I sympathise very much with the frustrations of people who have been queueing for petrol. I really, really do.\\n'I understand how infuriating it is when you can't get petrol at the pumps, but I must repeat that this has overwhelmingly been a problem of demand, not supply.'\\nHe added: 'What I am getting at is that the tanker drivers, the lorry drivers, they have got more than the average week's supply to the pumps for the last few days, and that is the situation.'\\nHe also said: 'I think even the Petrol Retailers Association have been saying that the situation has been improving markedly.\\n'What you are seeing is the UK economy coming back into life, really sort of stretching its legs, starting to move again, and of course there's been a bit of creaking here and there because we haven't had such activity in a long time.'\\nMr Johnson played down fears over spiralling inflation, saying the tackling underlying productivity problems was the way to 'fix' rising prices.\\nHe\u00a0said the market would address current demand-led shortages and the shift away from fossil fuels would have a long-term effect on energy bills.\\nBoris Johnson today refused to rule out an early general election in 2023 as he insisted he is 'focusing on the job in hand'.\\nThe Prime Minister said that 'nobody is thinking about that right now frankly' and 'we want to get on with delivering'.\\nHe repeatedly declined to commit to serving a full term, with the next election currently scheduled to take place in 2024.\\nThere is growing speculation that Mr Johnson could go to the country earlier than planned.\\nThe Government is in the process of repealing the Fixed-term Parliaments Act which was rolled out in 2011 and dictates that parliamentary terms last for up to five years.\\nThe legislation, introduced by the Coalition Government, dictates that following the election in 2019, the next national poll will take place on Thursday May 2, 2024.\\nThe Conservative Party pledged in its most recent manifesto to get rid of the law, arguing that it should be up to the PM when elections are called.\\nCurrently an election can only be triggered outside of the normal parliamentary cycle if two thirds of MPs vote in favour of one or if the Government loses a vote of no confidence.\\n'This Government is going to fix it for the long-term by making investments in renewable power that we can rely on in this country,' he said.\\nMr Johnson added: 'This Government is doing the difficult, long-term things. We got Brexit done, which was a very difficult thing to do, and we are now going to address the big, underlying issues that face the UK: long-term lack of productivity, long-term lack of investment in energy and infrastructure.\\n'We are going to fix that.\\n'That will have a big downward pressure on costs and that is the way to tackle inflation.'\\nHe also\u00a0defended ending the \u00a320 a week boost to Universal Credit, arguing the taxpayer should not subsidise low wages.\\n'I understand that people feel times are difficult at the moment because we have got an economy that's coming out of a very tough period with the Covid pandemic and it's growing strongly now,' he said.\\n'We've got the fastest economic growth in the G7.'\\nAs the Conservative gathering enters its final stages, Home Secretary Priti Patel will today announce plans to hit eco-warriors with a new type of Asbo in an attempt to halt their motorway protests.\\nJustice Secretary Dominic has unveiled a deal to force criminals in 'chain gangs' to clear rubbish from waterways.\\nMr\u00a0Johnson said Insulate Britain protesters are 'irresponsible crusties' who have been 'doing considerable damage to the economy'.\\n'There are some people who call those individuals legitimate protesters,' he said.\\n'They are not. I think they are irresponsible crusties who are basically trying to stop people going about their day's work and doing considerable damage to the economy.\\n'That is why we have taken the powers and why Priti Patel is doing the right thing to bring in powers so they can get six months or an unlimited fine.'\\nThe Home Secretary is expected to confirm plans for tougher powers against the likes of Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion in her conference speech.\\nProtesters from Insulate Britain have blocked major roads including the M25 and the M4 in recent weeks.\\nA court injunction was taken out to prevent their blockade of the M25, but demonstrations have continued, most recently on roads across London on Monday.\\nBoris Johnson has\u00a0branded protesters who have blocked major UK roads as 'irresponsible crusties'.\\nThe PM said Insulate Britain protesters, who have blocked highways across the South East in recent weeks, have been 'doing considerable damage to the economy'.\\nHis comments come ahead of Home Secretary Priti Patel's speech to conference, in which she will lay out new measures to deal with demonstrators deemed to be disruptive.\\nMr Johnson told LBC: 'There are some people who call those individuals legitimate protesters.\\n'They are not.

'It is critical for the training and development of young people. How can you learn a new job on Zoom?'\\nMr Johnson launched an ill-fated attempt to get office staff back to their desks last year, which was wrecked by the emergence of the second wave of Covid.\\nScientific advisers have pressed him not to repeat the exercise this year because working from home is one of the most effective ways of slowing the spread of the virus.\\nInstead the Government left it up to employers to encourage a 'gradual return to the workplace'.\\nBut a second Tory source said ministers were now hopeful they would not have to issue another work from home order this winter.\\n'You can never rule anything out with Covid,' the source said. 'But we are now in early October and hospitalisations are still running at manageable levels.\\n'We are not at the point of anyone thinking about Plan B.\\n'Even if we get to that point, it would start with things that cause relatively little disruption, such as mandatory masks and Covid certification.'\\nx", "image": [["Robert Shepard is closing his business after over 50 years due to the

I even took part in the Black Lives Matter movement by selling my food to students at a discounted price for Black History Month, and raised money for the Black Minds Matter Charity. I enjoy cooking and love to bring good vibes with the flavours especially at this difficult time. Shelz Soul Food brings people together in a positive, fun and safe way.'\\nThe incident, which took place on the morning of October 13, was the 13th major protest by the eco-zealots in four weeks after the group targeted the M25, the Blackwall Tunnel in London and the Port of Dover - at a time where the country is already facing a major supply chain crisis.\\nThe eco-mob are demanding the Government pay to better insulate Britain's social housing stock, but have come under fire over claims one of the group's ringleaders lives in a home which is not properly insulated.\\nOthers members of the green group, which last week suspended their 'campaign of civil resistance' ahead of next week's Cop26, have been revealed to have jet-setted across the globe.\\nGovernment officials meanwhile are attempting to use injunctions and court powers to bring an end to the disruptive protests of the eco-zealots - who have repeatedly bounced from police station to protests with police seemingly unable to stop them.\\nToday, an injunction granted to Transport for London against Insulate Britain protesters has been extended by a High Court judge.\\nLondon's transport network was granted the order earlier this month, which is aimed at preventing the Extinction Rebellion offshoot from obstructing traffic on some of the capital's busiest roads.\\nIt came after the group shut down\u00a0Old Street, near the hipster enclave of Shoreditch in east London.\\nA judge said the injunction was extended either until a trial is held, a further court order or April 8 next year.\\nThe TfL injunction bans\u00a0the protesters from blocking traffic in various locations across the capital, such as Vauxhall Bridge, Tower Bridge, London Bridge and Chiswick roundabout.\\nIt applies to busy London spots including\u00a0Hanger Lane, the Hammersmith gyratory system, Blackwall Tunnel,\u00a0the A501 ring road from Edgware Road to Old Street, Staples Corner, Redbridge roundabout and the Kidbrooke interchange.\\nProtesters are also barred from Park Lane,\u00a0Marble Arch Hyde Park Corner, Elephant and Castle -\u00a0 including all entry and exit roads and the Victoria one-way system.\\nMembers of the protest group have also been made subject to three other injunctions granted to National Highways, banning demonstrations on the M25, around the Port of Dover and on major roads around London.\\nIn a hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in London on Tuesday, Mr Justice Lavender extended the TfL injunction and granted permission for the list of named individuals it covers to be amended.\\nThe judge said the injunction was extended either until a trial is held in the case or a further court order or April 8 next year.\\n'This doesn't rule out the possibility that it could be extended again by a judge on a further occasion,' he added.\\nLast week, the court heard that National Highways may ask for a default or summary judgment - legal steps which would mean the case against the protesters is resolved without a trial.\\nMr Justice Lavender also granted a request by TfL's barrister, Andrew Fraser-Urquhart QC, for further disclosure of information by the Metropolitan Police relating to arrests.\\nDuring Tuesday's hearing, Insulate Britain members were given the chance to address the court.\\nDr Diana Warner, a retired GP, told the court that Insulate Britain is 'intent on keeping the public safe' and 'committed to non-violence'.\\nThe 62-year-old added that there is a 'wide gulf' between her understanding of 'what constitutes safety' and National Highways' stance.\\nDr Warner said National Highways should slow traffic to 10 or 20 miles per hour when people are on the motorway, warning that she expects to continue Insulate Britain's campaign for 'civil resistance' until 'a meaningful statement from the Government that we can trust'.\\n'I'm willing to give up my freedom and my house. These are all the material things I have,' she said, adding that there is 'everything to lose if we destroy the Earth that sustains us'.\\nBreaching a court order can result in a committal for contempt of court, which, if proved, may be punished with up to two years in prison and an unlimited fine.\\nAt Tuesday's hearing, Mr Justice Lavender emphasised to those in court which injunctions are in place and encouraged people who find themselves served with a committal application to seek legal advice.\\nAt a High Court hearing held last week, the same judge extended the three National Highways injunctions.\\nThe eco-zealots last week revealed they would\u00a0'suspend their campaign of civil resistance' until October 25 - ahead of the Cop26 summit in November.\\nActivists penned a letter to Boris Johnson\u00a0saying they would stop their hated antics and quoted the PM's hero Sir Winston Churchill in an apparent bid to win him over.\\nThe surprise move was just hours after it emerged more than a dozen of their members will finally face court action and possible jail within days.\\nJust over a month after the first roadblocks brought chaos to the motorways, officials are set to ask judges to take action against the eco-warriors.\\nInsulate Britain's letter to the PM revealed it planned to suspend protests for 11 days.\\nIt said:\u00a0'Insulate Britain would like to take this opportunity to profoundly acknowledge the disruption caused over the past five weeks.\\n'We cannot imagine undertaking such acts in normal circumstances. But the dire reality of our situation has to be faced.\\n'Ahead of COP26, Insulate Britain will suspend its campaign of civil resistance until Monday 25th October.\\n'In light of the speech you made (to the UN on the 22nd September) in which you recognised that ''We are approaching that critical turning point \u2013 in less than two months \u2013 when we must show that we are capable of learning, and maturing, and finally taking responsibility for the destruction we are inflicting, not just upon our planet but ourselves'', we ask you to use this time to signal that you believe what you say.\\n'We invite you to make a meaningful statement that we can trust, a statement that the country wants to hear: that your government will live up to its responsibilities to protect us, to defend law and order; that your government will take the lead needed to insulate and retrofit our homes; that it will 'get on with the job' so families can feed their children and keep their homes warm.\\n'We invite you to do the right thing, so we can be secure in the knowledge that our government did everything it could to protect and defend our country.'\\nThe statement began with a quote attributed to Sir Winston Churchill, Mr Johnson's hero who he has written a biography about.\\nIt said: 'Owing to past neglect, in the face of the plainest of warnings, we have entered upon a period of danger.\\n'The era of procrastination, of half measures, of soothing baffling expedients, of delays is coming to its close.

The extended time was partially down to activists using superglue which created delays for officers in safely removing people and opening roads.\\nOn Bishopsgate, one passer-by shouted at the activists: 'If anyone gets cancer, please let it be people you know, please let it be people you know. So you know what it's like to have your loved ones who can't get treatment. You can sit here, I hope you know what it's like. My father needs treatment and you sit here doing this. Scum.

If anyone gets cancer, please let it be your family - let you know what it feels like. All of you.'\\nTraffic on Bishopsgate was brought to a halt as protesters blocked the road at the junction of Camomile Street. At least seven buses were held up as the activists sat in the road at the traffic lights, and four police vehicles were on the scene.\\nOne activist seemed to have been taken ill and was lying on the floor as a police officer spoke with him.

Get a job. I was trying to get to work and have had to walk just to get there. I pay my taxes!'\\nToday marked the 14th time that Insulate Britain had caused disruption on motorways or A roads in London over the past six weeks. The group had warned last Friday that they would restart their blockades this week.\\nThe campaign continues despite injunctions leaving them facing court summons and possible imprisonment or an unlimited fine. Last week papers were served against nine of the demonstrators, and they could face up to two years in prison for contempt of court.\\nThe organisation said it would 'rise up against tyranny' in response to the Government's Net Zero reports released last week which it said 'completely fail to meet the challenges we now face'.\\nInsulate Britain, which wants all UK homes insulated by 2030 to cut carbon emissions, had previously said on October 14 that it was pausing its protests - which have caused major disruption - until this morning.\\nLeaflets handed out to people by protesters apologised for the disruption today. The flyers said Insulate Britain is asking the UK Government to invest in homes across the country to make them free of fossil fuels.\\nThe message read: 'Dear driver, we are peaceful and non-violent.

We worked as quickly as possible to safely make arrests and clear any disruption.'\\nEarlier, the force had said: 'A total of 52 people have been arrested following a number of protests across London and the City of London this morning.\\n'We responded alongside City of London Police to events on Bishopsgate, Upper Thames Street, Limehouse and on Southwark Bridge.

They should know that one way or another this country will have to stop emitting carbon.\\n'We can do that now in an orderly, planned way, insulating homes and preventing thousands of deaths from fuel poverty or we can wait until millions have lost their homes and are fighting for water or starving to death.\\n'This treasonous government has betrayed the public.

We can't be bystanders. Short term disruption or genocide - that's your choice.'\\nTracey Mallaghan from Insulate Britain said: 'I am gutted that we've had to return to the roads and irritate people. I am irritated too. I am a single mum and I don't have time to read climate science and parliamentary reports, but I've read the Chatham House report and it's terrifying.\\n'Everyone should read it and ask why their government isn't taking the action necessary to defend our country from the climate crisis.\\n'I understand, more than most, that money is tight and many people are struggling and stressed beyond belief. It's hard to see the bigger picture when you are anxious about putting food on the table but stop and think for a moment.\\n'The people on the road are not your enemy, they are not the ones that have betrayed you and f***ed over this country. They are acting out of love to protect your children and people everywhere from misery, starvation and death.'\\nThe group's co-founder Roger Hallam previously said he would block an ambulance carrying a dying patient so he could get Insulate Britain's message across.\\nAn Insulate Britain spokesman said last Friday: 'Insulate Britain has considered the British Government's Heat and Buildings Strategy, the Net Zero Strategy and the Cost of Net Zero report.\\nLondon's pollution charge zone for older vehicles has been significantly expanded, affecting tens of thousands of motorists.\\nDrivers of vehicles which do not comply with minimum emissions standards are being charged \u00a312.50 to drive in the Ultra Low Emission Zone (Ulez), which became 18 times larger on Monday.\\nThe Ulez has operated since April 2019, but previously only covered the same area of central London as the Congestion Charge.\\nIt now includes all areas within the North and South Circular roads in an attempt to boost air quality.\\nPollution charges also operating in Birmingham and Bath, and are proposed for cities across England and Scotland including Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, Newcastle and Portsmouth.\\nWhether or not a vehicle is liable for London's charge depends on how much nitrogen dioxide (NO2) it emits.\\n'We concluded that, while these would have been a good first step 30 years ago, they completely fail to meet the challenges we now face.\\n'What we need in this 'period of consequence' is a wartime style national effort, a united front of shared sacrifice, not a plan to cross your fingers and hope for the best.\\n'Therefore Insulate Britain will continue our campaign of nonviolent civil resistance.'\\nInsulate Britain claimed that the Government's 'plan to decarbonise our homes fails on almost every measure'.\\nIt said the \u00a3450million allocated to grants for heat pumps will help only 30,000 households a year, which is a 'drop in the ocean' compared with the 900,000 a year required by the Climate Change Committee by 2028.\\nA spokesman concluded: 'Our ancestors fought a civil war to remove such tyranny from these islands and sacrificed their lives to win the rights and freedoms we now enjoy as citizens.\\n'Today it is our turn, our responsibility, to rise up against tyranny. We owe that to our ancestors, to our fellow citizens and to those that come after us in the great chain of life.'\\nOn Tuesday last week, an injunction aimed at stopping Insulate Britain protesters blocking roads in London was extended by a High Court judge.\\nLondon's transport network was granted the order earlier this month, aimed at preventing the actvists obstructing cars on some of the capital's busiest roads.\\nMembers of the protest group have already been hit with three other injunctions granted to National Highways, banning demonstrations on the M25, around the Port of Dover and on major roads around London.\\nDuring last week's hearing, Insulate Britain members were given the chance to address the court.\\nDespite their campaign being on a temporary pause, they have repeatedly shown their contempt for the injunctions by disobeying them and burning papers copies.\\nBreaching a court order can result in a committal for contempt of court, which, if proved, may be punished with up to two years in prison and an unlimited fine.\\nThe judge, Mr Justice Lavender, said last week that the injunction was extended either until a trial is held in the case or a further court order or April 8 next year.\\nDr Diana Warner, from the group, said National Highways should reduce motorway speed limits to as low as 10mph when Insulate Britain protests on a carriageway.\\nBY RORY TINGLE FOR MAILONLINE\\nPetrol prices have reached an all-time high after rising by almost 30p in a year, while diesel is still a little short of its previous record, new data shows.\\nThe average UK price of petrol hit 142.94p a litre on Sunday, beating the former record, set in April 2012, by 0.46p, according to the AA. Meanwhile, diesel reached 146.5p a litre on Sunday, short of its all-time high of 147.93p.\\nThe RAC called it a 'truly dark day for drivers', which coincides with the expansion of London's Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) that will leave another 130,000 drivers facing \u00a312.50 a day charge.\\nThe motoring group has said fuel price rises are mainly due to the rapidly increasing cost of oil, which has gone from $40 a barrel a year ago to $85 now. But it says the introduction of E10, a new petrol blend which contains less carbon, has also had an impact.\\nThe margin retailers are taking on every litre sold is also greater than it was prior to the start of the pandemic, putting further upward pressure on prices.\\nIronically, at the end of last week, wholesale diesel to be delivered to forecourts was still around 6p a litre more expensive than petrol \u2013 as it had a fortnight earlier.\\nThe rebound from pandemic lows of 106.48p in mid May 2020 has seen petrol climb rapidly, with short lulls in November 2020 at around 114p a litre and this August at 135p a litre.\\nThis compares with a two-and-a-half-year rebound following the financial crash in 2008-9. That went in two hops, from 86p a litre in January 2009 to 121.5p in May 2010 and then above 137p in May 2011. Overall, that was a rise of 51p a litre.\\nHowever, the 2009 to 2011 period saw fuel duty rise from 52.35 pence per litre to 58.95 pence per litre in January 2011, before falling back to 57.95 pence per litre the following March. VAT also rose to 20%.\\nRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: 'This is truly a dark day for drivers, and one which we hoped we wouldn't see again after the high prices of April 2012. This will hurt many household budgets and no doubt have knock-on implications for the wider economy.\\n'The big question now is, 'where will it stop and what price will petrol hit?' If oil gets to 100 dollars a barrel, we could very easily see the average price climb to 150p a litre.\\n'Even though many people aren't driving as much as they have in the past due to the pandemic, drivers tell us they are just as reliant on their cars, and many simply don't have a choice but to drive. Those on lower incomes who have to drive to work will seriously struggle to find the extra money for the petrol they so badly need.\\n'We urge the Government to help ease the burden at the pumps by temporarily reducing VAT, and for the biggest retailers to bring the amount they make on every litre of petrol back down to the level it was prior to the pandemic.'\\nLuke Bosdet, the AA's fuel price spokesman, said: 'Whether it's down to oil producers, market speculators, Treasury taxes or struggling retailers trying to balance their margins, record pump prices must be saying to drivers with the means that it is time to make the switch to electric.\\n'As for poorer motorists, many of them now facing daily charges to drive in cities, there is no escape. It's a return to cutting back on other consumer spending, perhaps even heating or food, to keep the car that gets them to work on the road.'\\nSmall business owners today said the price rises were pushing their firms 'to the brink'.\\nDrew Robinson, founder at JToB Apothecary, said: 'As a small business with tight margins, every cost hike wherever it is has a significant impact.\\n'As I sell at farmers markets, which I have to drive to, I'm seeing my income dwindle away and I'm powerless to do anything about it. These petrol price increases are taking my business to the brink.'\\nDominik Lipnicki, Director at Your Mortgage Decisions Ltd, said: 'This is yet another kick in the teeth for people already struggling with a hike in energy prices and inflation as a whole.\\n'The fear for homeowners now is that this puts further pressure on the Bank of England to increase the base rate.'\\nMeanwhile, Jez Lamb, founder at Beers@No.42, said rising cost of fuel would leave business owners having to decide whether to pass cost increases onto customers.\\n'Another day, another challenge for the average small business owner, especially those whose jobs involve transport, delivery and drop-offs,' he said. 'This is yet more price hikes that we have to swallow among all our other rising costs.\\n'We'll undoubtedly see couriers increase their prices under the banner of a ''fuel surcharge'', but do we pass this onto our own customers who are already being hit with prices rising elsewhere? It's yet another headache and challenge to overcome.'\\n", "image": [["Police officers detain Reverend Sue Parfitt, 79, from Bristol, at an Insulate Britain protest on Bishopsgate in London today",

The 31 year old carpenter spent four months touring Canada taking 8,500 mile return flights and travelling hundreds of miles to see the country. The environmentalist then bought an environmentally-unfriendly old diesel van\u00a0 and used it to tour hundreds of miles around continental Europe with a girlfriend. After returning from his second extended holiday he saw no contradiction in joining protests stopping other people from travelling.", "text": "One of the leading climate protesters who has repeatedly helped bring Britain\u2019s roads to a standstill over the last month has himself enjoyed two epic carbon-generating international road trips in the previous two years.\\nExtinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain activist Cameron Ford was photographed on his 31st birthday being dragged away from blocking the M25 last month - one of several such protests he\u2019s joined, frustrating tens of thousands of drivers.\\nBut MailOnline can reveal that in the two years before his activism with breathtaking hypocrisy ringleader Ford has indulged himself not once but twice in lengthy trips abroad.\\nWhen approached about his travels today Ford admitted he was a hypocrite but was unrepentant about his protests.\\nHe went on a 10,000 mile four month trip across the Atlantic and around Canada - then just months later on a 2,000 mile plus jaunt across much of Europe in an old diesel van.\\nThe fossil fuels burned and the resulting carbon emissions generated by Ford\u2019s two trips would have been more than double the entire annual carbon footprint a single person in many countries produces in an entire year.\\nYet no sooner had he returned from the second trip than he was lecturing others.\\nHis incredible carbon-busting holiday marathon began in the autumn of 2019 as Ford embarked on a four month jaunt across Canada which involved a round trip of 8,500 miles in flights alone.\\nHe then travelled extensively around Canada for 120 days, posting occasional updates of him having fun in Edmonton, ice swimming in a lake in Alberta, and later sledging in British Columbia. These are just the locations he posted about but they alone mean he must have travelled at least 1,500 miles within Canada too on top of his flights - taking the entire distance travelled over 10,000 miles.\\nAnd regularly while he was enjoying this trip of a lifetime, despite its negative effects on the environment, Ford - apparently oblivious to the contradiction - was also regularly posting content promoting Extinction Rebellion and its twin pressure group Insulate Britain.\\nHe took this trip despite research published just weeks before he embarked showing that just a single long-haul flight generates more carbon emissions than an average person in many poorer countries consumes in a whole year.\\nHe finally returned to the UK in January 2020 but had only been back a matter of days when he began planning his next international trip - again apparently oblivious to the personal contributions to global warming this would inevitably cause.\\nOn January 15 he was asking advice about what van to buy for his next trip. It\u2019s not clear what he went on to spend but by August he had clearly not only bought a van but driven it many thousands of miles around continental Europe.\\nIn an album he entitled \u2018From Whittlesford to Warsaw\u2019 on August 29 he posted 25 pictures showing himself and a female companion cavorting around a series of exotic locations during the previous weeks visibly enjoying themselves at each.\\nThe direct trip between the two places would involve a round trip of well over 1,500 miles driving - and it\u2019s plain that Ford took many pleasure-driven deviations. This means he would have generated at least 380kilos of carbon.\\nPerhaps he used a modern low-emission vehicle? No - quite the contrary. The same \u201clovely little van\u201d he used for the trip, a diesel-powered Citroen, he then offered for sale in January this year by which - no doubt boosted by Ford\u2019s penchant for globe-trotting - it had an astonishing 145,000 miles on the clock.\\nOnce back in England Ford then saw no contradiction in stopping other motorists - most of whom would have been driving much shorter distances with more compelling reasons than he just had - being able to move around.\\nFord has been involved repeatedly in these blockades in recent weeks despite the danger to the lives of sick people stuck in jams, of crashes resulting from protesters rushing into moving traffic as well as the fumes the resulting traffic generate.\\nContacted today by MailOnline, Ford accepted the hypocrisy of his globe-trotting, but claimed he'd recently seen the light and cut down on his air miles.\\nHe said: 'We're all hypocrites. As soon as I found out about the environmental crisis I ramped that right down.'\\nHowever this is inconsistent with his own Facebook output which shows that he posted repeatedly about Extinction Rebellion and global warming before, during and after both trips.\\nFord then attacked media scrutiny of his travels, saying:\u00a0\u00a0'Let's report on the climate crisis. We're 95 per cent likely to miss the 2 Celsius global warming target - that's what journalists need to focus on, not trying to demonise us people who are trying to save that eventuality.'\\nFord, a carpenter and Buddhist from Whittlesford in Cambridgeshire, was identified by The Times last month as one of the XR movement\u2019s most persistent activists\\nHe was interviewed by a local paper last month about his activities when he told The Cambridge Independent: \u2018I don't feel very comfortable [blocking roads].\\n\u2018This is really unsettling. I've never blocked a road before. People are trying to get on with their everyday lives and I understand that's the case.\\n\u2018This is hugely disruptive and no one wants their lives disrupted.

These include plastic additives, flame retardants and the non-stick/stain chemicals from frying pans and fabrics.\\n'We often think of sewage as faeces but it's also all our washing liquids, powders, shampoos and shower gels and the pharmaceuticals we excrete.\\n'We have studied sperm counts in Langstone Harbour where the drone footage was taken and discovered that the crustaceans have low sperm counts.\\n'Previous studies in the Tyne and Tees, which are quite industrialised, had flounder (a type of flatfish) which were intersex (displaying testes and ovaries) throughout due to oestrogenic pollutants, such as the contraceptive pill, and chemicals which can act like oestrogens from our household products.'\\nScientists have previously blamed seismic surveys of the sea floor for the deaths of whales and other marine life.\\nThe noises these tests make are so loud they penetrate through the ocean and miles into the seafloor, then bounce back, bringing information to the surface about the location of buried oil and gas deposits.\\nCampaigners say in some cases they are known to occur on a recurring basis, sometimes going off every ten seconds, for 24 hours a day, often for weeks on end.\\nThese noises can harm whales, dolphins and fish, either by causing\u00a0temporary and permanent hearing loss, abandonment of habitat, disruption of mating and feeding, beach strandings, and even death.\\nWind turbines are currently being planted in the sea not far from the mouth of the Tees in the North East of England, and ships have been carrying out these seismic tests recently.\\nHowever, most experts think this is unlikely to be to blame for the deaths of thousands of crabs and lobsters in the North East.\\n'It's the first I have heard of this theory,' said\u00a0Alex Ford, professor at the Institute of marine science at the University of Portsmouth.\\n'There is a lot of testing in Newcastle and along the North Sea and noise is also created during pile driving but I am not aware of any study before that would link this to mass death.\\n'Whilst seismic testing is known to impact the behaviour and physiology (e.g. hearing) of whales and dolphins due to their sensitive hearing and we know invertebrates are sensitive to noise, I'm not aware of any seismic testing resulting in just large numbers of dead crustaceans being washed up on the shore.'\\nHowever, he said it was still possible this could be the cause, adding that he would be 'intrigued' if it was.\\nThe\u00a0Marine Management Organisation \u2014 an arm of the Government \u2014 has not said whether seismic testing could be the cause of the deaths.\\nNor has the Environment Agency, but it is carrying out tests to see whether pollution has led to so many crustaceans washing up dead.\\nGreenpeace told MailOnline that it wasn't aware of crustacean die-off, or any marine life die-off, from offshore wind farm construction\\nIn April, Professor Ford and a team of experts at the University of Portsmouth conducted a study investigating the sperm quality in marine life at Langstone Harbour.\\nThey found that creatures in the area had 70 per cent less sperm than those in less polluted locations.\\nSpeaking on the long term impact of the dead crustaceans appearing on beaches Mr Ford\u00a0added:\u00a0'If this is a disease this could affect the sea creatures in the area that feed off them and it means a proportion of their food will be taken away.\\n'It could also affect local fisheries and could see them decline.'\\nWind turbines are currently being planted in the sea not far from the mouth of the Tees in the North East of England, and ships have been carrying out these seismic tests recently.\\nHowever, most experts think this is unlikely to be to blame for the deaths of thousands of crabs and lobsters in the North East.\\nMr Ford said: 'They conduct pile driving when constructing the wind farms which creates noise and vibrations but I would put this in a similar category to the seismic surveys for oil and gas.\\n'It's less likely until the natural storms, algal blooms, disease or chemical pollution have been ruled out. '\\nMeanwhile a spokesperson at Greenpeace told MailOnline: 'I'm not aware of any examples of crustacean die-off, or any marine life die off, from offshore wind farm construction.\\n'In general terms, my understanding is that marine life tends to move away from offshore wind farms during construction, and then returns in greater numbers after completion (due to the reef effect).'\\nThis week\u00a0Marske resident Sharon Bell, who walks the stretch of beach near her home every day, said the numbers of creatures have steadily increased over the past two weeks.\\nShe was out early on Monday morning photographing the sunrise with her husband Christopher when the pair arrived at the beach and were horrified to find huge piles of dead and alive crabs and lobsters littered across it.\\nMrs Bell, 48, who has lived in the area for 21 years, said: 'They spent the next four hours trying to return any live ones they could find back into the water.\\n'I have been along my usual walk from Marske to Saltburn and was utterly shocked and saddened to see in some parts, waist deep seaweed full of thousands of dead and alive crabs and lobsters, all kinds and species.\\n'I have never seen anything like this.\\n'My husband and I have spent hours putting as many live ones as we could back in the sea, something is very, very wrong here.

This means the justice system could be plunged into chaos by the sheer number of people arrested at the event.\\nAmerican President Joe Biden is among more than 100 world leaders expected to attend the event.\\nThe summit will also feature a climate rally in Glasgow that could be attended by more than 150,000 people.\\nTens of thousands of delegates from 193 member states and four observer states will attend the summit, with the SEC conference venue designated a 'blue zone' \u2013 meaning it will be policed by the UN, with Scottish police only allowed to enter if there is a threat to life.\\nThe marches come the day before world leaders are to meet in Glasgow for the crucial climate conference where countries are under pressure to discuss and increase their ambition to tackle the climate crisis.\\nOn Friday, Ocean Rebellion activists poured 'oil' in front of Glasgow's Cop26 venue in protest ahead of the event.\\nAnother four XR protesters locked themselves to the Memorial Gates at the University of Glasgow using bike locks to demand that the establishment adopt the Green New Deal - a climate strategy developed by students and staff at the university.\\nPolice Scotland Chief Constable Iain Livingstone, Scotland's most senior police officer, said his force will respond 'swiftly and robustly' to protesters who try to disrupt the summit.\\nHe said the force - together with 7,000 officers from other parts of the UK who have been deployed to Scotland to help police Cop26 - was 'ready for the challenges that lie ahead'.\\nSpeaking on Saturday, Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that Cop26 could be the 'world's moment of truth', as he urged leaders to use the Glasgow summit to bring about an end to climate change.\\nWith the United Nations summit due to get under way on Sunday, the Prime Minister pressed fellow world leaders to seize the moment and deliver on the target of preventing global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5C degrees above pre-industrial levels.\\nDowning Street said Cop26 will be one of the biggest events the UK has ever hosted, with 25,000 delegates expected from 196 countries and the European Union.\\nMinisters, climate negotiators, civil society and business leaders are set to take part in talks and debates over the course of the two-week conference.\\nMr Johnson, who is due to fly from the G20 in Rome to Glasgow on Sunday evening, said: 'Cop26 will be the world's moment of truth.\\n'The question everyone is asking is whether we seize this moment or let it slip away.\u00a0I hope world leaders will hear them and come to Glasgow ready to answer them with decisive action.\\n'Together, we can mark the beginning of the end of climate change - and end the uncertainty once and for all.'\\nThe Conservative Party leader has not struck an optimistic tone in the lead-up to the conference, repeating in interviews while in the Italian capital that he still rated the chances of success in Scotland as no more than six out of 10.\\nA group of US officials have enjoyed a tasting menu of Scottish cuisine, including Irn Bru and haggis, ahead of the Cop26 summit in Glasgow.\\nThe charge d'affaires at the US embassy in London, Philip Reeker, shared a video on Twitter of himself and fellow representatives whetting their appetites with an array of delicacies, including square sausage and Cranachan.\\n'That's not a bad soda,' said Mr Reeker as he sipped a glass of Glasgow-brewed Irn Bru.\\nOther delights enjoyed by the American team include cullen skink - a soup made from smoked haddock, potatoes and onions - which the testers said 'looks like an omelette' but tasted 'fabulous'.\\nHaggis was similarly well received, but when told it contains sheep's heart, lungs and liver, Mr Reeker responded: 'You probably shouldn't sell it with that.'\\nConfronted with a deep-fried Mars bar, the officials seemed bemused by an apparent similarity between American and Scottish tastes, with one proclaiming: 'Wait a minute... this is Scottish?'\\nOne official felt there was room for improvement for square sausage, suggesting it could be accompanied by cheese or avocado.\\nThe culinary adventure comes ahead of two weeks in Glasgow for the US officials and did not go unnoticed by Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.\\n'Enjoying the best of (Scotland Food and Drink) - thank you (Mr Reeker),' Ms Sturgeon tweeted.\\n'Wishing you a warm welcome to COP26 in Glasgow.'\\nThe Cop26 summit is aiming to urge countries to advance their net-zero commitments to the middle of the century and reduce emissions rapidly over the next decade through commitments on phasing out coal, switching to electric cars and planting trees.\\nDeveloped nations are also being urged to stump up the finance - 100 billion US dollars (\u00a373 billion) per annum - needed by poorer nations to deal with climate change.\\nNumber 10 said there is also a need to finalise the Paris Agreement at the event.\\nThe summit timetable will see the Prime Minister host an opening ceremony attended by dignitaries including the Prince of Wales, before giving a speech on Monday.\\nCharles and Sir David Attenborough, the Cop26 People's Advocate, will be among those to also address world leaders as British environmental advocates.\\nThe theme of the opening ceremony, due to take place at midday, is 'Earth to Cop', which Downing Street said would deliver a message from the people for leaders to heed warnings and advance progress to tackle climate change.\\nOn Monday evening, the Prime Minister will host a reception to welcome world leaders to Glasgow, alongside the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall.\\nThe Queen will address the delegates in a pre-recorded video after she was told by doctors to avoid the summit and rest following a hospital visit last week.\\nAt the reception, guests will be offered refreshments of traditional Scottish canapes, Ridgeview vintage English sparkling wine and Cop26 blended whisky supplied by the Scotch Whisky Association.\\nGuests will enjoy music from a string quartet and brass quintet from the Royal Scottish National Orchestra.\\nMeanwhile, a few dozen protesters demanding that government leaders take incisive action on climate change have been carried away by police from the main boulevard near the G-20 summit site in Rome.\\nHours before the leaders of the United States, Britain, France and other economic powerhouse nations arrived on Saturday for the start of the two-day gathering, the activists blocked the road, holding banners, including one that read, 'From Rome to Glasgow, your solutions are the problem.'\\nSome wore death masks and others played soccer with a ball symbolizing the planet's health on the first day of the summit where climate concerns are a top issue for many of the world leaders in attendance.\\nLet me at him, Trudeau!

and will meet one-on-one at the summit tomorrow.\\nAsked if there was a sense of 'de ja vu' after he and Mr Macron clashed over Brexit at the G7 summit earlier this year, Mr Johnson insisted he wasn't worried about the ongoing feud and said he's got 'bigger fish to fry'.\\nLeaders of the world's 20 biggest economies endorsed on Saturday a global minimum tax aimed at stopping big business from hiding profits in tax havens, and also agreed to get more COVID vaccines to poorer nations.\\nAttending their first in-person summit in two years, G20 leaders broadly backed calls to extend debt relief for impoverished countries and pledged to vaccinate 70% of the world's population against COVID-19 by mid-2022.\\nHowever, with a crucial U.N. climate conference due to start in just two days, the G20 appeared to be struggling to throw its weight behind the sort of strong new measures that scientists say are needed to avert calamitous global warming.\\nItaly, hosting the gathering in Rome, put health and the economy at the top of the agenda for the first day of the meeting, with the more difficult climate discussions set for Sunday.\\nUnderscoring the way the coronavirus crisis has up-ended the world, doctors in white coats and Red Cross workers joined the leaders for their traditional 'family' photograph -- a tribute to the sacrifices and efforts of medics across the globe.\\nAddressing the opening of the meeting, being held in a steel and glass convention centre, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said governments had to work together to face up to the formidable challenges facing their peoples.\\n'From the pandemic, to climate change, to fair and equitable taxation, going it alone is simply not an option,' Draghi said.\\nThe corporate tax deal was hailed as a evidence of renewed multilateral coordination, with major corporations facing a minimum 15% tax wherever they operate from 2023 to prevent them from shielding their profits in off-shore entities.\\n'This is more than just a tax deal \u00e2 it's diplomacy reshaping our global economy and delivering for our people,' U.S. President Joe Biden wrote on Twitter.\\nWith the world roiled by rising energy prices and stretched supply chains, Biden was expected to urge G20 energy producers with spare capacity to boost production, notably Russia and Saudi Arabia, to ensure a stronger global economic recovery, a senior U.S. administration official said.\\nDimmed Hopes\\nLike many of the other G20 leaders in Italy, Biden will fly straight to Glasgow on Sunday for the United Nations' climate summit, known as COP26, which is seen as crucial to addressing the threat of rising temperatures.\\nThe G20 bloc, which includes Brazil, China, India, Germany and the United States, accounts for an estimated 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but hopes the Rome meeting might pave the way to success in Scotland have dimmed considerably.\\nChinese President Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin both decided to follow events only via video link and diplomats looking to seal a meaningful accord said both countries, as well as India, were resisting ambitious new climate goals.\\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged the G20 and COP26 talks would be difficult, but warned that without courageous action, world civilisation could collapse as swiftly as the ancient Roman empire, ushering in a new Dark Age.\\n'It's going to be very, very tough to get the agreement we need,' he told reporters, standing next to the ruins of the Colosseum amphitheatre - a symbol of once mighty Rome.\\nClimate efforts\\nA draft communique seen by Reuters said G20 countries will step up their efforts to limit global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius - the level scientists have said is necessary to avoid disastrous new climate patterns.\\nThe document also acknowledges that current national plans on how to curb harmful emissions will have to be strengthened, but offered little detail on how this should be done.\\nAdditionally, the leaders are set to pledge to halt financing of overseas coal-fired power generation by the end of this year, and to 'do our utmost' to stop building new coal power plants before the end of the 2030s.\\nApparently relishing in-person diplomacy after months of relative isolation, the leaders held numerous meetings on the sidelines, including discussions between the United States, Britain, Germany and France on Iran's nuclear programme.\\n'It is great to see all of you here, after a difficult few years for the global community,' Draghi said, catching the largely upbeat mood amongst those present.\\nFar from the conference centre, known as 'The Cloud', several thousand protesters staged a loud, but peaceful demonstration in the city centre to demand action to stem climate change.\\n'We are holding this protest for environmental and social issues and against the G20, which continues undaunted on a path that has almost led us to social and ecological failure,' said protester Edoardo Mentrasti.\\nReporting by Reuters.", "image": [["Greta Thunberg has arrived in Glasgow ahead of the Cop26 summit, as world leaders prepare to discuss the climate crisis", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/30/18/49837667-10147937-image-a-28_1635616492244.jpg"], ["On Saturday evening, Ms Thunberg tweeted: 'Finally in Glasgow for the #COP26!

But the officer tells him to 'get back in your car'.\\nAnother driver on the A40 today removed the group's banners, shouting: 'Get out the road'. While being filmed by Greatest Hits Radio, he added: 'Who's going to help me move them, someone help me move them?'\\nAnd a BBC reporter at the scene said:\u00a0'Now the police are here, but have readily admitted they're too short-staffed to move them off the road, so this disruption will probably last for at least a few hours here.'\\nAs drivers faced two-mile tailbacks on the A40, the Metropolitan Police said 17 people were arrested including six who were glued onto the road.\\nA spokesman said: 'Officers have arrested 17 Insulate Britain activists for obstructing the highway at the A40 junction/Gypsy Lane, North Acton. Police worked quickly to get roads open again. Traffic is now flowing. Thanks to motorists for their patience.'\\nMeanwhile, protesters at Dartford were unhappy at how quickly the police turned up, with one of the activists telling the Guardian: 'We're here again, Insulate Britain, and we're attempting to block this road.\\nA retired Anglican vicar was once again back at the Insulate Britain protests today - marking at least the sixth time she has been arrested in as many weeks.\\nReverend Sue Parfitt, 79, from Bristol, who has also protested with Extinction Rebellion, was taken away from near the Dartford Crossing in Kent this morning after she blocked the road with other activists.\\nJust two days ago she was also arrested on\u00a0Bishopsgate in the Liverpool Street area for exactly the same offence.\\nShe has also already been arrested at other protests on the M25 on September 13, 21 and 29, and October 13.\\nParfitt was fined more than \u00a31,500 in July after she took part in two XR road blockades in Parliament Square and outside a Ministry of Defence site near Bristol.\\n'Police arrived very quickly, arresting us. I'm fine, it would have been good if we'd had a little longer, but we're here, and we're doing it, and we're still making the same statement whether it's for a long period or short.'\\nAnd one teenage demonstrator in Dartford was overheard saying on Sky News just before he was pulled off the road by a police officer: 'I'm 18, I'm terrified of all the war that will happen because of the climate.'\\nKent Police arrested six people in Dartford at a Hilton hotel car park before the protests even started. Protesters included Amy Pritchard and Tony Hill, who were also sat on Bishopsgate in London on Monday.\\nMiss Pritchard, who claimed to have been arrested 11 times since September 13, said: 'The plan is we are being searched and are about to be arrested. We were going to go on to the roundabout to obstruct it. We've been prevented from entering the roundabout. The police have not been charging us with anything or interviewing us.\\n'There's been a political decision not to deal with us and we don't want to be blocking roads, so it is fine.\u00a0And we will continue until our demands are met and we are prevented from doing this. The decarbonisation at the speed and scale that is necessary is more important than the legal consequences for us all individually.'\\nAnd Mr Hill, a\u00a0former police officer and soldier who is now a councillor, said: 'I'm here through anger, fear and determination. Forgive us this disruption but please understand the reasons why we are doing it, for the disruption today will be nothing compared to what we get in the future of climate catastrophe.'\\nKent Police also arrested 14 people on the A206 and another 14 by the nearby M25. A total of around 40 activists descended on Dartford, with some of them glueing their hands to the road or to each other to delay their removal.\\nBut Insulate Britain taunted the force in a statement saying: 'Insulate Britain would like to congratulate Kent Police for the swift and robust action they have taken today though it must be frustrating to have to devote resources to intelligence gathering on people from Insulate Britain, when we could have been in prison weeks ago.'\\nAnd the activists warned that the disruption will continue, with a spokesman for the group adding: 'Insulate Britain will return to the roads at the earliest opportunity to continue our campaign of nonviolent civil resistance until Boris Johnson gets on with the job of protecting the people of this country. Insulate Britain has a duty to continue our campaign and we will not be bystanders whilst the Government condemns this country to death.'\\nThe two protests comes one day after Insulate Britain urged drivers not to use the M25 as they threatened to bring chaos to the motorway again with a series of road blockades. The environmental campaigners also asked police to refuse to arrest them and had warned their 'non-violent civil resistance' would restart on the road from 7am today.\\nInsulate Britain, which is an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, added that if motorists do still choose to use the M25 this morning then their speed should be 'reduced to 20 mph to minimise the risk of accidents'.\\nToday's action - which started one hour later than planned - comes after the eco-zealots brought parts of Central London to a standstill once again on Monday, with several of them glueing their hands, feet or faces to roads.\\nFour court injunctions have been taken out in response to the protests. Most recently, National Highways secured a ban on activities which obstruct traffic on its 4,300-mile network of motorways and major A-roads in England.\\nThis came in the wake of an injunction granted to the Government-owned agency on Monday, which prohibits Insulate Britain activists from interfering with traffic on any part of the strategic road network in England.", "image": [["The man walked along a line of sitting protesters and squirted them in the face with a bottle of in", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/13/49698619-10136153-image-a-17_1635336549592.jpg"], ["Friends have hailed Mr Dutton a 'hero' for taking a stand against the eco mob as they caused yet more mayhem on London's roads \u00bf despite court injunctions banning them from staging the sit-down protests", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/13/49698635-10136153-image-a-19_1635336567746.jpg"], ["One man on the A40 in West London threw ink over one of the protesters today - a 77-year-old retired doctor called Christian", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/13/49691067-10136153-Drivers_on_the_A40_in_West_London_threw_ink_over_one_of_the_prot-a-28_1635337292599.jpg"], ["Retired doctor Christian, 77, is an Insulate Britain protester who had ink thrown at him by angry drivers\u00a0 on the A40 on Wednesday", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/13/49692919-10136153-image-a-30_1635337316664.jpg"], ["Reverend Sue Parfitt is arrested again today in Dartford, Kent", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/13/49693281-10136153-Reverend_Sue_Parfitt_is_arrested_again_today_in_Dartford_Kent-a-44_1635337334477.jpg"], ["Police arrest Sue Parfitt on Bishopsgate in London on Monday", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/13/49604717-10136153-Police_arrest_Sue_Parfitt_on_Bishopsgate_in_London_on_Monday-a-34_1635337326189.jpg"], ["September 13", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/13/48235513-10136153-September_13-a-36_1635337326217.jpg"], ["September 21", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/13/48235515-10136153-September_21-a-38_1635337326247.jpg"], ["September 29", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/13/48537341-10136153-September_29-a-39_1635337326270.jpg"], ["October 13", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/13/49113025-10136153-October_13-a-41_1635337326329.jpg"]], "author": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "date": "2021-10-27"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10082371/Insulate-Britain-protester-arrested-blockading-M25-married-170-000-year-TfL-boss.html": {"title": "Revealed: Motorway-blocking Insulate Britain protester arrested multiple times for causing travel chaos is married to \u00a3170,000-a-year TfL boss in charge of keeping public transport moving", "subtitle": "Cathy Eastburn is an Insulate Britain protester planning to 'unleash hell' on roads.

If I had the courage of my convictions I'd be joining them. There is a climate emergency that will result in untold suffering if unchecked.'\\nIt comes after a tearful woman was seen yesterday trying to get to her unwell 81-year-old mother in a Canterbury hospital slammed 'selfish' eco-morons who had blocked the\u00a0Blackwall Tunnel, Hanger Lane and Wandsworth Bridge between 8am and 12pm.\\nTensions flared as a paramedic crew joined furious drivers and pulled enviro-idiots - some of whom are repeat offenders who have been arrested and released by police during past demos - off the road at Wandsworth Bridge, while a woman at Blackwall Tunnel trying to get to her mother in hospital lashed out at the mob: 'How can you be so selfish?'\\nMarried father-of-one Bill Wilson, 55, who has serious health problems after spending weeks in a coma after testing positive for Covid, was even forced to cancel three important hi-tech scans at Royal Brompton Hospital due to Insulate Britain's stunt.\\nThe eco-mob's protest - the eleventh in the past month - caused huge tailbacks and inflicted misery on millions of people trying to get into the capital, including workers trying to help kickstart London's wounded economy after 18 months of Covid restrictions.\\nBut attempt to justify his stance,\u00a0Hallam told\u00a0Unbreak the Planet:\u00a0'What we're talking about is the loss of people's pensions in the next ten years, the loss of people's incomes, the mass migration of hundreds of millions of people, the indescribable injustice to people of colour in the global south because of the collective selfishness of people in the north.\\n'We're talking about the biggest crime in human history imposed by the rich against the global poor.'\\nFarmer Roger Hallam, 55, who helped found Extinction Rebellion,\u00a0before leaving to joining protest organiser Insulate Britain, wants to 'bring down all the regimes in the world', starting with Britain, and believes those running society 'should have a bullet through their heads'.\\nThere have been allegations of a 'cult-like' following for the Welshman who compares his tactics to those of heroic activists Gandhi and Martin Luther King. He is said to have been inspired to take up climate activism after his farm in Wales went bust due to bad weather.\\nIronically, Mr Hallam owns a farmhouse which was described as 'poorly insulated' in an official energy performance certificate. His 2,000 sq ft farmhouse in Carmarthen, South Wales, was given the lowest possible energy rating on the certificate. It is unclear if Mr Hallam has taken steps to improve the rating since it was issued six years ago.\\nAsked about the certificate, a spokesman for the group said: 'This is the point - UK homes are the leakiest in Europe, with many millions of families being unable to afford the advice and help needed to insulate the building they live in.'\\nJoining Mr Hallam was David McKenny, 38, from Cambridge, who was one of six XR protesters who 'doorstepped' TV wildlife expert Sir David Attenborough, 95, at the height of pandemic after he criticised their tactics. The group posted a letter through Sir David's door as he isolated due to his age last year.\\nHallam has also compared the murder of six million Jewish people at the hands of the Nazis to other historical massacres and claimed that memory of the Holocaust was holding Germany back.\\nThe\u00a0former organic farmer was quickly condemned by\u00a0Extinction Rebellion groups in Germany after his comments with a newspaper in the country.\\nIn an English-language interview he told Die Zeit: 'The extremity of a trauma...can create a paralysis in actually learning the lessons from it. The fact of the matter is, millions of people have been killed in vicious circumstances on a regular basis throughout history.'\\nHe cited the Belgian colonialists who 'went to the Congo in the late 19th century and decimated it'.\\nHallam also\u00a0wants those responsible for climate change\u00a0\u00a0to face Nuremberg-style trials. Asked how those responsible for climate change should be dealt with, he told The Times: 'The question will be who's culpable, in the same way [as] with the Nazis.\\n'Was it just the top Nazis or was it the small guys?'\u00a0He added that 'maybe [we] should put a bullet in the head' as punishment.\\n\\n\\nHallam,\u00a0an organic farmer who lost his business because of severe weather, set up his splinter group when he caused a rift within XR by telling a German newspaper the Holocaust was 'just another f***ery in human history'. He later said his remark was taken out of context.\\nThe climate zealot has also called for those 'responsible' for climate change to face Nuremberg-style trials and even suggested they should receive a 'a bullet in the head' as punishment. He told the Times:\u00a0'The question will be who's culpable, in the same way [as] with the Nazis.\\n'Was it just the top Nazis or was it the small guys?'\\nInsulate Britain,\u00a0which is demanding that the Government insulate the UK's 29 million homes by 2030, brazenly defied another injunction\u00a0meant to stop them from causing traffic chaos while Met Police officers appeared to stand idly by. The force eventually tweeted the roads were clear of protesters at 12.20pm - more than four hours after the demo began.\\nThe group have\u00a0targeted major commuter routes into the capital as millions of workers are encouraged to get back into offices to help kickstart London's wounded economy after 18 months of various Covid restrictions including national lockdowns.\\nThe latest stunt also comes amid a fuel crisis in London and the South East which is so severe that Army tanker drivers\u00a0are taking to the roads yesterday to deliver supplies to beleaguered petrol stations as panic-buyers leave forecourts dry.\\nThirty-eight arrests have been made after police came under intense public criticism for\u00a0failing to move protesters off the roads quickly in the past. Officers previously complained that they lack powers to stop them from bringing\u00a0the M25, M1 and M4 to a standstill.\\nAn Insulate Britain spokeswoman said:\u00a0'We're more scared of what will happen when the climate crisis causes the breakdown of law and order, than we are of injunctions and prison. The Government is focussing on us rather than what's coming down the road. They need to face up to reality.\u00a0If our Government really wants to do something for hard-working families it should act decisively to insulate Britain's homes. It will help people with rising energy bills, prevent 8,500 fuel poverty deaths this winter and cut carbon emissions in the most cost-effective way possible.'\\nYesterday's rush hour demo comes just 24 hours after Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to lock up activists who cause gridlocks on vital transport arteries for six months or impose unlimited fines in a bid to get tough as the Tory Party conference opens in Manchester.\\nIt is also likely to heap further pressure on under-fire Scotland Yard chief Cressida Dick, who has been batting away growing calls to resign after presiding over a litany of failures including the rape and murder of Sarah Everard by Met officer Wayne Couzens.\\nHallam co-founded XR three years ago with Gail Bradbrook and Simon Bramwell.\\nExplaining the fallout, Bramwell said: 'Roger is a very controversial figure and he can be difficult to get on with. But at the end of the day we both want the same thing and I have to admit that he is someone who gets things done.'\\nIn his interview with the Mail, Hallam said: 'Insulation isn't the sexiest thing in the world. But it's what most ordinary people care about.'\\n'Everyone knows someone in fuel poverty, and lots of old people are in houses which are damp and cold in the winter and it kills thousands of people a year, prematurely.'\\nHe has also said he wants to 'bring down all the regimes in the world', starting with Britain, and believes those running society 'should have a bullet through their heads'.\\nThere have been allegations that he has 'cult-like' followers who liken him to Martin Luther King.\\nAccording to The Times, Insulate Britain's protest strategy revolves around the mass imprisonment of its activists, making it even more extreme than Extinction Rebellion.\\nAt a meeting earlier this year, Hallam said: 'We have an absolute responsibility to go further. Five hundred people in prison will produce legislative change.\\n'Going to a bank and smashing windows [as XR have done] is not material resistance. It's symbolic and it's not going to change anything. What will change things is if fuel supplies stop, or people can't get to work in the mornings.'\\nHallam believes that calls for more insulation are 'achievable and winnable', in comparison to more 'grand-scale demands'.\\nA Metropolitan Police spokesman tweeted: 'Officers are dealing with protestors who have blocked parts of the A2, A3, A12 and A40. While the roads remain open, there is heavy disruption at all four locations with slow moving traffic while work is underway to remove those who have glued themselves onto the road.\\n'So far, 38 arrests have been made for disruption of the highway and conspiracy to cause public nuisance.\\n'At approximately 0800hrs, protestors blocked the southern approach of Blackwall Tunnel. By 0809hrs police were on scene.\u00a0At 0820hrs, protestors moved onto the North Circular Road near Hanger Lane and blocked the road. Officers were on scene by 0828hrs.\\n'At 0845hrs, protestors obstructed the road at the junction at Lochnagar Street at northern approach of the Blackwall tunnel. Officers were on scene within minutes. At 0846hrs, a number of protestors moved onto Wandsworth Bridge. Officers are on scene by 0900hrs.\\n'We consider protests of this nature unreasonable and are acting as quickly as possible to minimise disruption caused to members of the public using the roads.'\\nHome Secretary Priti Patel will this week unveil the crackdown on motorway protests, with tougher sentences introduced by amending the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill.\\nWhile National Highways has been granted injunctions to prevent people from obstructing roads, officers cannot arrest people for flouting the court orders because it is a civil not a criminal matter.\\nThe new laws are expected to be on the statute book by the turn of the year.\u00a0However, Whitehall sources remain wary that the government can only go so far in terms of restricting disruption.\\nAn offence of 'obstructing a highway' already exists, but carries only a maximum fine of \u00a31,000. The proposed increased penalties will mean police can remand protesters in custody after charging them, and create a criminal record for them.\\nInsulate Britain - which is demanding the Government pay for all homes in the country to be insulated by 2030 - has brought major roads to a standstill with eleven protests in less than three weeks. Around 450 arrests have been made so far.\\nMr Johnson said: 'This Government will always stand on the side of the law-abiding majority and ensure the toughest penalties possible for criminals who deliberately bring major roads to a standstill.\\n'We will give the police the powers they need to stop their reckless and selfish behaviour. The right to protest is sacrosanct, but there is no right to inflict chaos and misery on people trying to go about their lives.'\\nThe Prime Minister outlined his hardline stance against the backdrop of the separate road chaos caused by the 'absolutely horrendous' fuel crisis, which has led to a critical shortage of petrol on forecourts across London and the South East of England.\\nThe Government obtained an injunction meaning anyone blocking the M25 could be found to be in contempt of court, which carries a maximum penalty of two years in prison or an unlimited fine.\\nEmail tips@dailymail.com or jack.wright@mailonline.co.uk\\nSo far the first injunction, taken out on September 21, has had little to no effect on the protests - and appears to have made the campaigners even more focused on causing as much disruption as possible around the capital.\\nThe injunctions do not give the police extra powers, and instead give National Highways the ability to apply to a court to find someone in contempt of court. But this makes no immediate difference and can take months to sort.\\nA senior Government source last night said: 'We can't have Labour councillors and crusties making life hell for mothers on the school run and van drivers making vital deliveries. The law does not currently reflect the serious disruption caused by these dangerous actions.'\\nMiss Patel said: 'The right to protest is a fundamental principle of our democracy but we will not tolerate guerrilla tactics that obstruct people going about their day-to-day business.\\n'That is why we will increase the maximum penalty for disrupting a motorway to an unlimited fine or up to six months in prison - or both.\\n'While the Labour Party stand on the side of these so-called 'activists', the Conservative Party will always back the law-abiding, hard-working majority in this country.'\\nAmid reports of conflict between the Home Office and the DfT, sources said Miss Patel was aghast at the length of time being taken to deal with the crisis by the DfT's highways agency.\\n'The real problem is with National Highways,' one source said. 'Priti is concerned that it has been very slow in responding. It has just not been quick enough.'\\n\\nSeptember 13 - 78 Insulate Britain protesters are arrested after blocking junctions 3, 6, 14, 20 and 31 of the M25\\nSeptember 15 - More than 50 protesters are arrested after targeting junctions 1, 8, 9 and 23 of the M25.\\nSeptember 17 - 48 protesters are arrested after targeting junctions 3, 9 and 28 of the M25, as well as the M3\\nSeptember 20 - 29 protesters are arrested after blocking the M25 at junctions 4 and 18, as well as the A1\\nSeptember 21 - Protesters risk death by running into moving traffic to block the main carriageway near Junction 10. Some 38 arrests are made. National Highways obtains an injunction against further protests on the M25\\nSeptember 22 - Protesters burn copies of the injunction outside the Home Office, blocking the road outside the ministry. No arrests are made\\nSeptember 24 - 39 protesters are arrested after blocking roads at three locations in Dover. They are all released under investigation. National Highways obtains a second injunction covering Dover\\nSeptember 27 - 53 protesters are arrested for blocking a slip road at Junction 14 of the M25. They are all released under investigation.\\nSeptember 28 - National Highways says it is taking 'legal advice' over how to enforce its injunction\\nSeptember 29\u00a0- 27 protesters are arrested for blocking a roundabout at Junction 3 of the M25 on two separate occasions\\nSeptember 30\u00a0- Protesters return to junction 30 at Thurrock in Essex, and nine are arrested\\nOctober 1:\u00a0The group block the M4 at junction 3, the M1 at junction 1 and M25 at junction 25. Some 39 arrests\\nOctober 4: Around 50 protesters block four major roads in London - the Blackwall Tunnel, Wandsworth Bridge,\u00a0Hanger Lane and Arnos Grove\\nThe proposal for a contra mundum injunction - Latin for 'against the world' - is believed to have come from former Solicitor General Michael Ellis QC, who was appointed Paymaster General in Boris Johnson's reshuffle last month. Proposals for the measure are being drawn up and will be put to a High Court judge within days, the Mail understands.\\nDeputy Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Stephen House described the protests as 'lunacy' and said he feared officers' lives are at risk dealing with the demonstrations.\\n'The most recent one I saw had officers running between articulated lorries that were moving on the main carriageway of the M25,' he told the London Assembly.\\nPolice forces have improved in their response to the protests, sometimes managing to reopen carriageways within an hour.\\nNational Highways - previously Highways England - and its bosses at the DfT, however, have failed to respond convincingly to a crisis about to enter its fourth week.\\nWhen first asked about how they would enforce the injunction after it was flouted on Monday, National Highways wrongly said that this was an 'enforcement matter' for the police. However, a day later the agency said it was 'taking legal advice' after realising it was up to them to haul the protesters to the High Court for potential imprisonment or a fine.\\nOn Wednesday the injunction was breached twice more, when protesters blocked junction 3 of the M25 on two occasions.\\nNational Highways said it was 'working with the police to establish names of the protesters and if they have been previously arrested', despite their identities being widely reported.\\nSimultaneously, the DfT claimed it could not 'comment on the specifics around ongoing legal matters', despite contempt of court proceedings being public.\\nBy Wednesday evening, however, the DfT said it was 'already knocking on doors and serving papers to offenders who will be sent to court and could face fines or prison'.\\nTory activists jeered the mention of Insulate Britain during a Cabinet minister's speech, as one attendee called for the protesting environmentalists to be 'locked up'.\\nA reference by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps to 'Insulate Britain or whatever they are calling themselves these days' was met with boos at a fringe Maritime UK drinks reception at the Conservative Party conference on Sunday evening.\\nOne attendee at the Manchester reception could be heard saying 'lock them up' after Mr Shapps mentioned Insulate Britain, which is an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion.\\nThe reaction came as the Transport Secretary was giving a speech about the need to build carbon emission-free ships, which he said could be used for 'booze cruises'.\\nHe said: 'Here is a dirty little secret about this sector that you all know, but don't tell those folks from Insulate Britain or whatever they are calling themselves these days - transport and aviation are often targeted because of their greenhouse gases as they are two very visible forms of transport, but actually when it comes to shipping, they (environmental groups) largely ignore it, thank goodness for that.\\n'But actually UK shipping is a producer of greenhouse gases - we need to sort that out.\\n'We know that we expect trade to double over the next few decades, so to get permission for maritime to continue, we need to sort it out as well.'\\nMr Shapps said Britain could 'lead zero carbon in shipping by 2050' through technological innovation in ship building.\\nThe former Tory party chairman added: 'We can go on booze cruises together - but those cruises are going to be completely green, we're going to remove all the carbon, it is going to be an eco-friendly ship that we are all going to be travelling on, and we're going to build that ship in Britain.'\\nEmail tips@dailymail.com or jack.wright@mailonline.co.uk", "image": [["Speaking to the Unbreak the Planet podcast, Insulate Britain mastermind Roger Hallam told presenter Mike Galsworthy that he would also have refused to move for a crying woman who was trying to get to her unwell 81-year-old mother in hospital", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/04/15/48744685-10056407-image-a-173_1633356888821.jpg"], ["This is the moment a van driver attempted to get round Insulate Britain protesters as they started to block the A12 at the Blackwall Tunnel", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/04/09/48733967-10056407-image-a-32_1633334590667.jpg"], ["Activists from Insulate Britain climate change protest group block the Hanger Lane gyratory on the A40 junction", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/04/09/48733883-10056407-image-a-17_1633334454388.jpg"], ["Enviro-idiots have sparked traffic chaos yet again by blocking Blackwall Tunnel", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/04/09/48733973-10056407-image-m-36_1633334621498.jpg"], ["Britons also took to Twitter to share their frustration at the eco-zealots and group mastermind Hallam. , with one user, Lucy Lynton, saying: 'People like Roger Hallam of InsulateBritain make me feel disgust and fury.

Some 17 people were arrested by the Metropolitan Police in London, while Kent Police detained 32 - but Insulate Britain said the total number arrested was 55.\\nThe demonstrations lasted about two hours - having both began at about 8am. The A40 was reopened by 10am, while one lane in Dartford was open by 10.30am.\\nThe protesters have brought chaos to motorways and A roads in the capital since mid-September with 146 people taking part in the campaign and 739 arrests made so far - but no one has yet been charged.\u00a0The activists were effectively banned from all major roads in England on Monday after a landmark High Court ruling.\\nIn Dartford this morning, police held some of the drivers back and warned they could be arrested for assault if they touched the activists. One irate motorist was heard on Sky News telling an officer: 'I'll get the lorry down here and I'll run over them, I promise you, just saying. Drag them out the f***ing way mate, will you?'\\nMeanwhile another driver got out a set of bagpipes and played them in the faces of protesters until police stopped him.\u00a0The man, who had a Scottish accent, said: 'They are holding up ambulances, fire trucks. Disgraceful. You're damaging your cause. What I was doing, obnoxiously, bagpiping in your face, is what you're doing to all this traffic - you're obnoxiously holding up people's lives. You're damaging your cause guys, you're actually damaging your cause.'\\nAs a further motorist tried to pick up the protesters, an officer told him: 'No, don't even think about it.' That driver was then heard saying: 'Get out of the road, we've got work to do. We're trying to earn money here. We've got people trying to get to school, we've got people going to school, get out the f***ing road.' He then tells the officer: 'Get them out the road, why ain't you nicking them?' But the officer tells him to 'get back in your car'.\\nMotorists stuck in North Acton shortly after 8am this morning were so angry at the protesters sitting in front of them that one man squirted blue ink over them - covering a 77-year-old retired doctor called Christian.\\nChristian said: 'It wasn't painful, it didn't hurt - it was unpleasant, but just sad, the whole thing's sad, it's sad that we have to do this. I hate doing it, I'm a retired doctor, I've spent my whole life trying to help people, and I'm reduced to having to do this because the Government won't address the problem adequately, basically. Terribly worried.'\\nAnother driver on the A40 today removed the group's banners, shouting: 'Get out the road'. While being filmed by Greatest Hits Radio, he added: 'Who's going to help me move them, someone help me move them?'\\nAnd a BBC reporter at the scene said:\u00a0'Now the police are here, but have readily admitted they're too short-staffed to move them off the road, so this disruption will probably last for at least a few hours here.'\\nAs drivers faced two-mile tailbacks on the A40, the Metropolitan Police said 17 people were arrested including six who were glued onto the road.\\nA spokesman said: 'Officers have arrested 17 Insulate Britain activists for obstructing the highway at the A40 junction/Gypsy Lane, North Acton. Police worked quickly to get roads open again. Traffic is now flowing. Thanks to motorists for their patience.'\\nMeanwhile, protesters at Dartford were unhappy at how quickly the police turned up, with one of the activists telling the Guardian: 'We're here again, Insulate Britain, and we're attempting to block this road.\\n'Police arrived very quickly, arresting us. I'm fine, it would have been good if we'd had a little longer, but we're here, and we're doing it, and we're still making the same statement whether it's for a long period or short.'\\nAnd one teenage demonstrator in Dartford was overheard saying on Sky News just before he was pulled off the road by a police officer: 'I'm 18, I'm terrified of all the war that will happen because of the climate.'\\nKent Police arrested six people in Dartford at a Hilton hotel car park before the protests even started. Protesters included Amy Pritchard and Tony Hill, who were also sat on Bishopsgate in London on Monday.\\nMiss Pritchard, who claimed to have been arrested 11 times since September 13, said: 'The plan is we are being searched and are about to be arrested. We were going to go on to the roundabout to obstruct it. We've been prevented from entering the roundabout. The police have not been charging us with anything or interviewing us.\\n'There's been a political decision not to deal with us and we don't want to be blocking roads, so it is fine.\u00a0And we will continue until our demands are met and we are prevented from doing this. The decarbonisation at the speed and scale that is necessary is more important than the legal consequences for us all individually.'\\nAnd Mr Hill, a\u00a0former police officer and soldier who is now a councillor, said: 'I'm here through anger, fear and determination. Forgive us this disruption but please understand the reasons why we are doing it, for the disruption today will be nothing compared to what we get in the future of climate catastrophe.'\\nKent Police also arrested 14 people on the A206 and another 14 by the nearby M25. A total of around 40 activists descended on Dartford, with some of them glueing their hands to the road or to each other to delay their removal.\\nBut Insulate Britain taunted the force in a statement saying: 'Insulate Britain would like to congratulate Kent Police for the swift and robust action they have taken today though it must be frustrating to have to devote resources to intelligence gathering on people from Insulate Britain, when we could have been in prison weeks ago.'\\nAnd the activists warned that the disruption will continue, with a spokesman for the group adding: 'Insulate Britain will return to the roads at the earliest opportunity to continue our campaign of nonviolent civil resistance until Boris Johnson gets on with the job of protecting the people of this country. Insulate Britain has a duty to continue our campaign and we will not be bystanders whilst the Government condemns this country to death.'\\nThe two protests comes one day after Insulate Britain urged drivers not to use the M25 as they threatened to bring chaos to the motorway again with a series of road blockades. The environmental campaigners also asked police to refuse to arrest them and had warned their 'non-violent civil resistance' would restart on the road from 7am today.\\nInsulate Britain, which is an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, added that if motorists do still choose to use the M25 this morning then their speed should be 'reduced to 20 mph to minimise the risk of accidents'.\\nToday's action - which started one hour later than planned - comes after the eco-zealots brought parts of Central London to a standstill once again on Monday, with several of them glueing their hands, feet or faces to roads.\\nFour court injunctions have been taken out in response to the protests. Most recently, National Highways secured a ban on activities which obstruct traffic on its 4,300-mile network of motorways and major A-roads in England.\\nThis came in the wake of a super injunction granted to the Government-owned agency on Monday, which prohibits Insulate Britain activists from interfering with traffic on any part of the strategic road network in England.\\nA\u00a0spokesman for Kent Police said: 'At 8.05am on Wednesday 27 October 2021, Kent Police received a report that a group of protesters had gathered at the A206 Crossways Boulevard and some of those involved had glued themselves to the road surface, or each other.\\n'Officers attended within minutes and by 8.30am traffic was flowing in both directions. Fourteen people were arrested.\\n\\nSeptember 13 - 78 Insulate Britain protesters arrested after blocking junctions 3, 6, 14, 20 and 31 of the M25\\nSeptember 15 - More than 50 protesters arrested after targeting junctions 1, 8, 9 and 23 of the M25\\nSeptember 17 - 48 protesters arrested after targeting junctions 3, 9 and 28 of the M25, as well as the M3\\nSeptember 20 - 29 protesters are arrested after blocking the M25 at junctions 4 and 18, as well as the A1\\nSeptember 21 - Protesters risk death by running into moving traffic to block the carriageway near Junction 10. Some 38 arrests are made. National Highways obtains an injunction against further protests on the M25\\nSeptember 22 - Protesters burn copies of the injunction outside the Home Office, blocking the road outside the ministry. No arrests are made\\nSeptember 24 - 39 protesters arrested after blocking roads at three locations in Dover. They are all released under investigation. National Highways obtains a second injunction covering Dover.\\nSeptember 27 - 53 protesters are arrested for blocking a slip road at Junction 14 of the M25. They are all released under investigation.\\nSeptember 28 - National Highways says it is taking 'legal advice' over how to enforce its injunction\\nSeptember 29\u00a0- 27 protesters are arrested for blocking a roundabout at Junction 3 of the M25 on two occasions\\nSeptember 30\u00a0- Protesters return to junction 30 at Thurrock in Essex, and nine are arrested\\nOctober 1:\u00a0The group block the M4 at junction 3, the M1 at junction 1 and M25 at junction 25.

Transport for London gets a High Court injunction to ban them from obstructing traffic in 14 locations in London.\\nOctober 13: Protesters return to the M25 at junction 31 and a nearby industrial estate, with 35 people arrested.\\nOctober 25: Activists target areas around Southwark Bridge, Canary Wharf and Liverpool Street station. Some 53 are arrested.\\nOctober 27: Protesters blockade the A40 in North Acton, West London, and a major roundabout next to the Dartford Crossing in Kent. Kent Police arrested 32 protesters, while the Metropolitan Police detained 17.\\n'Following the arrests in Crossways Boulevard, officers became aware of an additional four people who were suspected to be involved in the wider planning of the disruption. They were detained in a nearby car park.\\n'At around 9.05am, a further report of traffic being obstructed on a slip road for junction 1a of the M25, anti-clockwise, was received. Officers attended and detained a further 14 people, some of whom had glued themselves to the road surface. One lane is now flowing and officers are continuing to engage with several protesters at the scene.\\n'All of those detained were arrested on suspicion of obstructing a highway and/or conspiring to cause a public nuisance. They remain in custody as inquiries continue.'\\nAmong those involved in the protests today was Suzie, 47, from Cambridge, who works in childcare. She said: 'If going to prison and losing my home is what it takes to get the government to do the right thing and cut our carbon emissions then it's a price worth paying. I can't be a bystander while this government betrays the public, our children and future generations by failing to defend our country from the climate crisis.\\n'Insulating Britain's leaky homes has to come first. It will cut out a huge chunk of our carbon emissions, help families struggling with their energy bills and end fuel poverty. It's such a basic first step that you have to wonder why the government refuses to act. Don't they care?'\\nAnd Ben, 36, a geologist from Somerset said: 'Faced with 8,500 people dying from cold homes this winter and gaping holes in government carbon plans, I'm joining others and returning to the motorways.\\n'We cannot wait until the next election, this is not a party political issue. We need to insulate and retrofit homes now to cut our carbon emissions or we will jeopardize the future of the country and the entire world.\\n'There is widespread agreement that insulating our homes is urgent and necessary and that government plans are inadequate. The only question remaining is: will you join us on the motorway to demand action now?'\\nMeanwhile a spokesman for Insulate Britain said today: 'Insulate Britain has blocked part of the A40 in West London and a roundabout in Dartford this morning after declaring the M25 a site of nonviolent civil resistance yesterday.\\n'We are demanding that the government gets on with the job of insulating Britain's homes, starting with the homes of the poorest people in the country.\\n'The action comes in the wake of a super injunction granted to National Highways on Monday, which prohibits people from Insulate Britain from interfering with traffic on any part of the strategic road network in England.\\n'This is one of four temporary injunctions granted to National Highways and Transport for London in recent weeks.'\\nIt comes after a spokesman said yesterday: 'In light of a national injunction covering England's highways, Insulate Britain has declared the M25 a site of nonviolent civil resistance and called for motorway traffic to be slowed.\\n'You can't imprison a flood, there are no unlimited fines against a famine, you can't bankrupt a fire. You can imprison the ordinary people of Britain, yet the lives of our children and those of all future generations hang in the balance.\\n'By refusing to insulate Britain's homes, our government is also condemning thousands to death through fuel poverty this winter, while countless families will once again be cold and hungry.\\n'We are not concerned with endless injunctions. We are not concerned with our fears. We are concerned with fulfilling our duties and responsibilities at this 'period of consequence'.'\\nThe group added that the M25 will 'become a place of nonviolent civil resistance to stop our government committing crimes against humanity' from 7am today.\\nAn Insulate Britain activist who is married to a former BBC technology chief and lives in a \u00a3900,000 home was today back out protesting in Kent just two days after being arrested in London.\\nLouise Lancaster, 54, who left her job as a teacher to spend more time on climate activism, was seen glued to the road at a roundabout near the M25 Dartford Crossing this morning.\\nMrs Lancaster, of Grantchester, Cambridgeshire, has been a familiar figure at Insulate Britain protests in recent weeks and has repeatedly held up traffic while facing the ire of angry motorists.\\nHer husband Tim Lancaster, 54, who is a current director of a climate change research group due to take part in Cop26, has also been seen at the protests in recent weeks.\\nHe once worked on a 'green' initiative with a state-owned business in China while he had a high-flying post with the Carbon Trust, which fights climate change.\\nHe head of technology for BBC Worldwide for nine years before joining the Carbon Trust in 2005.\\nHe spent eight years at the taxpayer-funded organisation, initially as Operations Director before becoming its director in China working more than 5,000 miles away in Beijing.\\nMr Lancaster spent nearly three years in his role in China between 2008 and 2011, at a time when the one-party state was investing heavily in CO2-belching coal fired power stations to fuel its economic growth, and becoming notorious for human rights abuses.\\nHe was responsible for setting up the organisation's first office in China and 'developed a joint venture with a Chinese state-owned company to invest in low carbon technologies', according to an online biography.\\nMr Lancaster reveals his work in China for the Carbon Trust in his LinkedIn profile, saying he 'negotiated, setup and steered a venture capital company involving the Chinese and UK governments'.\\nThe Insulate Britain spokesman continued: 'This government, our government, is actively pursuing policies that will lead to the destruction of our country due to climate catastrophe.\\n'In a free society, citizens have the right and a duty to rebel against plans which will knowingly result in the deaths of millions.\\n'Insulate Britain acknowledges the inconvenience and irritation we are causing to the public in our campaign, we ask that you understand that the days of disruption are necessary to force a government to fulfil its most basic of duties to protect and defend its people.\\n'Insulate Britain considers the UK Government to be in treasonous betrayal of this country.'\\nThe group has set out three demands \u2013 the first being that people 'do not use the M25, or if they do, speeds are reduced to 20 mph to minimise the risk of accidents'.\\nThe second is that National Highways 'acts on its responsibilities to keep the public safe by enforcing this speed limit'.\\nAnd the third is that the 'police refuse to arrest us, as we are upholding the British constitution and they have a duty to refuse to obey any government that fails to uphold its first and most important responsibility: the protection of people in Britain.'\\nThe group also insisted: 'We will ensure that emergency 'blue light' access is maintained.'\\nOn Monday, Insulate Britain activists were effectively banned from all major roads in England following a major High Court ruling.\\nJudges approved the application of an injunction against protesting on 4,300 miles of motorways and major A-roads, also known as the Strategic Road Network.\\nAnyone breaking it faces unlimited fines or jail for contempt of court.\\nIt had originally been thought that the application, made by the country's roads agency National Highways, would not be granted as it is so wide-ranging and unprecedented.\\nIt came as Insulate Britain brought central London to a standstill once again on Monday, blocking hundreds of motorists - including one driving his father to hospital for cancer treatment.\\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed the expanded injunction had been granted on Monday night.\\nHe tweeted: 'Insulate Britain are back, risking lives & ruining journeys. 3 specific injunctions are already in place, but today I instructed @NationalHways to apply for an injunction covering the entire strategic road network - tonight this has been granted on a temp basis by the High Court.\\n'The long term solution lies in changes to the Police, Crime, Sentencing & Courts Bill, giving additional powers against disruptive protests which target critical national infrastructure.\\n'This includes unlimited fines & prison sentences of up to 6 months for obstructing highways.'\\nIt is understood the new injunction will last until Thursday, when another High Court hearing will take place to decide if it should be extended.\\nThe original injunctions only applied to the M25, feeder roads onto the M25 and the Port of Dover.\\nMembers of the group have repeatedly blocked major roads, including the M25 and the M4, since September 13.\\nTransport for London also has an injunction effectively banning protests.\\nLast week it emerged nine activists will become the first to be taken to court for allegedly breaking the original National Highways injunction, with a hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice on November 16.\\nFollowing Monday's protests, the Metropolitan Police said 53 people were arrested after obstructing four busy streets across central and east London during the morning rush hour.\\nThe blockades - the first since a temporary pause for ten days by the group - triggered fury from Londoners, with many being filmed trying to drag the eco-warriors off the carriageway.\\nIn one heated exchange, a man said he was trying to get his father to hospital for cancer treatment.\\nHe said: 'Do you know what it's like someone trying to get treatment for cancer and you're standing like this? People are trying to get to hospital, of all places.'\\nThe protests were the organisation's first since temporarily halting activities for 10 days from October 14.\\nMany of the activists superglued themselves to the road surface, with one even affixing his head to the tarmac.\\nIn a new tactic, they also handed out leaflets to drivers, in an apparent bid to discourage violence against them, after a woman rammed a protestor with her Range Rover earlier this month.\\nInsulate Britain issued three requests ahead of its M25 protests restarting this morning. They were:\\n\\nThe message read: 'Dear driver, we are peaceful and non-violent.\\n'We are sorry to delay your journey. For your safety please stay in your vehicle and do not drive on the hard shoulder, this is for emergency vehicles.\\n'The police are on their way. They will arrest us and you will be able to continue your journey.'\\nProtestor Tony Hill, 71, said he had travelled from near Kendal in Cumbria to the capital to take part.\\nHe said: 'I'm here today out of anger, fear and determination. The anger that my Government is failing the people of our country.\\n'The governments of the world are failing everyone. Everyone says we're at the 11th hour but we're at midnight and nothing substantial is being done by our Government and the governments across the world.\\n'We're saying insulate as many buildings as we can. It's a no brainer. It's something we can all do, it's a solution.\\n'We've got the money; all we need is the will power from our Government to do it. It will save money, create jobs, save lives and save the planet. Why aren't they doing it?'\\nBy midday, the last of the protesters at Bishopsgate and Camomile Street had been removed from the scene, letting the traffic flow freely once more.\\nThe campaign continues despite facing repeated threats of imprisonment or unlimited fine for breaking various injunctions.\\nYet Highways England is currently only applying for contempt of court proceedings to go ahead against nine protestors - with a court date yet to be scheduled.", "image": [["Reverend Sue Parfitt is arrested again today in Dartford, Kent", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/10/49693281-10135305-Reverend_Sue_Parfitt_is_arrested_again_today_in_Dartford_Kent-m-147_1635327851411.jpg"], ["Police arrest Sue Parfitt on Bishopsgate in London on Monday", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/10/49604717-10135305-Police_arrest_Sue_Parfitt_on_Bishopsgate_in_London_on_Monday-m-148_1635327887314.jpg"], ["September 13", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/25/10/48235513-10127473-Reverend_Sue_Parfitt_returned_to_the_protests_yesterday_after_be-m-231_1635153900379.jpg"], ["September 21", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/25/10/48235515-10127473-Reverend_Sue_Parfitt_returned_to_the_protests_on_Tuesday_after_b-m-229_1635153893518.jpg"], ["September 29", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/25/10/48537341-10127473-September_29-m-237_1635154006026.jpg"], ["October 13", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/25/10/49113025-10127473-October_13-m-239_1635154013667.jpg"], ["A man plays the bagpipes in the faces of Insulate Britain protesters sat on the road near the M25 Dartford Crossing today", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/10/49693291-10135305-image-a-141_1635327679469.jpg"], ["A man plays the bagpipes in the faces of Insulate Britain protesters sat on the road near the M25 Dartford Crossing today", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/10/49693285-10135305-A_man_plays_the_bagpipes_in_the_faces_of_Insulate_Britain_protes-a-129_1635327280057.jpg"], ["A motorist plays the bagpipes in Kent today", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/10/49693289-10135305-A_motorist_plays_the_bagpipes_in_Kent_today-m-128_1635327269130.jpg"], ["A motorist plays the bagpipes in front of protesters sat on the road in Kent", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/10/49693287-10135305-A_motorist_plays_the_bagpipes_in_front_of_protesters_sat_on_the_-m-126_1635327248336.jpg"], ["During the Insulate Britain protest in Dartford today, police had to hold some of the drivers back and warned them they could be arrested for assault if they touched the activists.

They weren't listening to me. When I was nice they ignored me. I thought I would get in the car and rev it a little bit.\\n'All of that \"ow ow\" was dramatic and fake. There's no way it hurt them.

Because I haven't got an axe to grind I'm only keen to get the damn thing sorted.'\\n\\nPrince Charles is being mocked on Twitter after revealing his Aston Martin is powered by cheese and wine during a\u00a0wide-ranging interview on the environment in which he also expressed his sympathies for Greta Thunberg and eco-idiots such as Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain.\\nSpeaking to the BBC in Prince George's Wood, an arboretum Charles created in the gardens of his house on the Balmoral estate, the senior royal explained how he had his classic blue 1970 Aston Martin -\u00a0gifted to him by the Queen for his 21st birthday in 1969 - converted so it runs on 'surplus English white wine' and whey from cheese production.\\nThe car now runs on a fuel called E85, which is made up of\u00a085 per cent bioethanol and 15 per cent unleaded petrol. By blending petrol with ethanol, motorists don't\u00a0need as much fossil fuel, which reduces carbon emissions and allows the vehicle to run 'cleaner'.\\nHowever, Twitter users were quick to mock the Prince of Wales' revelation - with many people pointing out that they 'also run on cheese and wine' while others asked if this means Charles is 'technically drink-driving'. Some questioned the meaning of 'surplus wine' while others checked if it was an April Fool's gag, posted: 'Did I hear that right? Prince Charles has converted his Aston Martin to run on white wine and cheese?? Is it April 1...?'\\nMost chose to completely ignore most of the rest of the Duke of Cornwall's astonishing interview with the Corporation, in which he expressed his sympathies for the eco-zealots who have been blocking Britain's busiest roads for the past month to pressure the Government to make homes 'environmentally-friendly' - but suggested 'it isn't helpful to do it in a way that alienates people'.\\nCharles, a longstanding environmental campaigner, also said he is 'deeply worried' about the future of the planet, accused humans of 'over exploiting' and damaging nature, and admitted he understands the frustrations of young people and climate activists such as Thunberg because they feel like 'nobody listens'.\u00a0He also revealed how he doesn't eat meat and fish on two days a week and dairy on one day.\\nThe Prince of Wales even took aim at electric cars in his interview, warning that they are too expensive and sharing his worries about materials for their batteries. He also called for hydrogen to be used more.\u00a0However, scientists have previously noted that hydrogen cars are less efficient than electric cars, partially because of the energy needed in breaking down the gas.\\nCharles also revealed his frustration at criticism he has received for his comments on nature in the past. Writing for the Mail in August this year, the prince urged business leaders to go green or the planet is 'done for', adding: 'We now have no alternative - we have to do all we possibly can in the short time left to us to avoid the enormous climate catastrophe that has already begun to show its face in the most terrifying ways.'\\nIn September last year, Charles called for a military-style response to the threat of climate change reminiscent of the US Marshall Plan to rebuild post-war Europe, saying the world was facing a catastrophe.\u00a0And during a 1986 interview, Charles infamously remarked that he talks to trees to help them grow, saying:\u00a0'I just come and talk to the plants, really - very important to talk to them. They respond.'\\nThe prince told the BBC: 'I don't know where it came from but it's what I really minded about. I mind about balance and harmony because if you push things too far, you will always create an equal and opposite reaction, which is exactly what's happening.\u00a0But in the meantime, if you're the idiot who suggests all this, you're accused of being an idiot.\\n'I was accused of being anti-science.\u00a0It wasn't much fun, as you can imagine, and then because I suggested there were better ways of doing things, I was accused of interfering and meddling.\\n'Having been ridiculed for so long, they suddenly all want me to help convene them. Because I haven't got an axe to grind I'm only keen to get the damn thing sorted.'\\nSpeaking about Thunberg and other climate activists, Charles said: 'All these young people feel nothing is ever happening so of course they're going to get frustrated. I totally understand because nobody would listen and they see their future being totally destroyed.'\\nDiscussing recent protests, he also added: 'I understand why they go out but it isn't helpful to do it in a way that alienates people. I totally understand the frustration. The difficulty is how do you direct that frustration in a way that is more constructive than destructive.'\\nIn 2008 Prince Charles asked Aston Martin if it would be possible to convert his Aston Martin DB6 to run on a more environmentally friendly fuel source.\\nThey turned to a firm called Green Fuels, based on Gloucester, who set about sourcing local produce and food by-products to make bioethanol.\\nThe team created a new version of a long-standing fuel called E85, that is made up of 85 per cent bioethanol and 15 per cent unleaded petrol. The source material for the bioethanol is where the wine and cheese come in.\\nGreen Fuels turned to a local vineyard and purchased 8,000 litres of surplus white wine - paying just 1p per litre for the unsold tipple in 2008. They ran it through their distillery and boiled off the 11 per cent alcohol, condensed it and removed any remaining water from the fluid.\\nThis left them with hundreds of litres of pure ethanol, topped up by alcohol taken from fermented whey - this was collected as a by-product of local cheesemaking, keeping to the local sourcing of raw materials.\\nThey then handed the fuel back to Aston Martin, who were able to tune the vehicle to accept the fuel - the final version of which is mixed with petrol.\\nOf the car, which Prince Charles had owned since the 1970s, he felt that if he wanted to keep it on the road he had an 'environmental and moral' obligation to modernise the engine to become less gas-guzzling.\\nThe final fuel, E85, is similar to the E10 petrol currently rolling out to UK forecourts, but instead of a majority petrol (E10 is 10% ethanol, 90% petrol), E85 is mostly ethanol.\\nBy blending petrol with ethanol you need less fossil fuel, which in turn reduces carbon emissions and allows the vehicle to run cleaner.\\nPrince Charles on Greta Thunberg and activists like XR\\nPrince Charles said he understands the frustrations of young people and climate activists because they feel like 'nobody listens'.\\n'All these young people feel nothing is ever happening so of course they're going to get frustrated. I totally understand because nobody would listen and they see their future being totally destroyed.\\n'The point is, people should really notice how despairing so many young are.'\\nDiscussing recent protests, he added:\u00a0'I understand why they go out but it isn't helpful to do it in a way that alienates people.\\n'I totally understand the frustration. The difficulty is how do you direct that frustration in a way that is more constructive than destructive.'\\nRecalling his own encounter with his Extinction Rebellion, the royal recalled how the group staged a sit-in at his Highgrove estate before leaving a letter praising him for his past comments on the climate.\\nPrince Charles on his green efforts\\nIn the interview, Charles revealed how he doesn't eat meat and fish on two days a week and dairy on one day.\\nMost remarkably, he explained how he had his Aston Martin converted so it runs on surplus English wine and whey from cheese production. The car, which he has had for 51 years, now runs on a fuel called E85 - made up of 85% bioethanol and 15% unleaded petrol.\\nDescribing his diet, he added: 'That's one way to do it. If more people did that it would reduce a lot of the pressure on the environment.'\\nCharles went on to list several other green measures he'd taken in recent years as he called on governments to take action.\\nHe said he had switched the heating of Birkhall to biomass boilers, using wood chips from trees felled in the estate's forest.\\nThe Prince has also installed solar panels at Clarence House, his London residence, and on the farm buildings of Highgrove.\\nThere are also heat pumps at some of his properties and a hydroelectric turbine in the river that runs beside Birkhall.\\nPrince Charles on being called an 'idiot' for speaking on green issues\\n'I don't know where it came from but it's what I really minded about. I mind about balance and harmony because if you push things too far, you will always create an equal and opposite reaction, which is exactly what's happening.\\n'But in the meantime, if you're the idiot who suggests all this, you're accused of being an idiot. I was accused of being anti-science.\\n'It wasn't much fun, as you can imagine, and then because I suggested there were better ways of doing things, I was accused of interfering and meddling.\\n'Having been ridiculed for so long, they suddenly all want me to help convene them. Because I haven't got an axe to grind I'm only keen to get the damn thing sorted.'\\nPrince Charles on world leaders and the Cop26 climate summit\\nHe criticised world leaders ahead of the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow, branding their efforts as 'just talk', adding: 'The problem is trying to get action on the ground which I've been trying to do for the last 40 years.'\\nThe prince added that the conference was 'a last chance saloon' and said it would be 'a disaster' if the world did not come together to tackle climate change.\\nHe said:\u00a0'I mean it'll be catastrophic. It is already beginning to be catastrophic because nothing in nature can survive the stress that is created by these extremes of weather.'\\nAsked if the UK Government, as the host of Cop26, was doing enough to fight climate change, Charles replied: 'I couldn't possibly comment.'\\nHe also expressed his frustration at how business executives still don't give environmental issues enough priority and said not enough young people have 'got to the top' to make a difference.\\nCharles added: 'We still have in place endless perverse subsidy regimes. We still have subsidies for insane agri-industrial approaches to farming which cause huge damage and contribute enormously to emissions. And we still have perverse subsidies for fishing in the oceans causing again mammoth damage, trawling up the bottom, deep trawling. It's crazy.'\\nCharles is due to attend a series of events at Cop26, alongside the Queen, the Duchess of Cornwall, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.\\nPrince Charles on nature\\nDiscussing nature, he explained:\u00a0'We are damaging nature by not understanding how much we depend on everything that nature provides. And also not understanding, or having been somehow trained to believe, that nature is a separate thing from us that we can exploit.\\n'I tried to say in other areas, years ago, that there is a sense of the sacred. Because when you think about Earth, the miracle of this sitting in the middle of the vastness of space. Yet somehow, everything works.\\n'How is that possible? It can't just be random chance. If you look into the way nature operates, the universal principles, which Islam understood so well from the Greeks and Egyptians, is that underlying everything are fundamental patterns. It's the most extraordinary thing the way the planets revolve.\\n'What we're doing with our own economy is to disrupt nature's economy.'\\nHis interview triggered intense debate online, with many taking to social media to express their shock at his comments.\\nOne person joked: 'I think Prince Charles is confusing his beloved Aston Martin with my dad.'\\nA supporter said: 'Prince Charles has been talking about this for years. Way ahead of his time.'\\nHowever, another person, pointing out flights taken by the prince, wrote: 'I'm not being lectured on Climate Change by Prince Charles.'\\nCharles has long been a proponent for tackling environmental issues - though his attempts have garnered controversy.\u00a0 In 2019, he was accused of promoting disproven and dangerous medical treatments in his new position as patron of the Faculty of Homeopathy.\\nThe Prince of Wales is a long-time supporter of homeopathy and has used his royal position to try to get it widely accepted. This is despite some homeopaths operating in the UK claiming to cure autism and offering alternatives to traditional vaccinations.\\nHomeopathy is a branch of medicine that treats ailments using extremely diluted doses of natural substances. It is known as a complementary or alternative approach because it is different from traditional Western medicine.\\nCharles has previously lobbied ministers to use more alternative medicine such as homeopathy on the NHS because he 'couldn't bear people suffering unnecessarily'. In a letter to then Health Secretary Alan Johnson in September 2007, he said an 'anti-homeopathy campaign' was damaging the health service.\\nIn the letter, he said he 'couldn't bear to see people suffering... when a complementary approach could make the difference', with a focus on depression, back pain, eczema and irritable bowel syndrome.\\nThe prince has said he will not campaign on issues such as homeopathy when king.\\n'I'm not that stupid,' he told the BBC. 'I do realise it is a separate exercise being sovereign.\u00a0I understand entirely how that should operate. I've tried to make sure whatever I've done has been non-party political, but it's vital to remember there's only room for one sovereign at a time, not two.'\\nIn 1986, he was also widely ridiculed after he revealed that he talked to his plants, claiming that they 'respond'.\u00a0In 1970, he warned about the problems of plastic waste, chemicals being discharged into rivers and air pollution caused by factories, cars and planes.\\nSince his speech on February 19, 1970, to the Countryside Steering Committee for Wales, Charles has worked to develop solutions to climate change and highlighted issues like overfishing and the threat to the world's rainforests.\\nCharles is due to attend a series of events at Cop26, alongside the Queen, the Duchess of Cornwall, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.\u00a0The 12-day summit aims to secure more ambitious commitments to limit global warming to well below 2C with a goal of keeping it to 1.5C compared with pre-industrial levels. The conference has been billed as crucial to delivering the goals of the Paris Accord which, when it was agreed in 2015, recognised countries needed to significantly increase action to cut greenhouse gases.\\nHis comments come after weeks of chaos caused by Insulate Britain blocking motorways and other busy roads across the country.\\nThe group is threatening a fresh wave of mayhem if the Government does not agree to its demands. It plans to cause more misery by yet again blocking major roads in a series of sit-down protests on Wednesday.\\nActivists will warn Boris Johnson that he has ten days to commit to their ultimatum on home insulation before they 'unleash hell' on innocent drivers simply trying to get to work or see loved ones.\\nThe Prime Minister plans to hit the activists with huge fines and up to six months in jail with new powers dubbed 'Asbos for crusties'. But they remain undeterred and have pledged to 'create a whirlwind' in their bid to force the Government to insulate all social housing by 2025.\\nThey want to cause as much chaos as possible in the run-up to the COP26 summit in Glasgow next month, with one ringleader saying it would be the 'icing on the cake' if protesters were sent to prison on remand.", "image": [["Prince Charles expressed his sympathy for groups like XR and activists like Greta Thunberg in a wide-ranging BBC interview", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/13/49012849-10080211-Speaking_about_Greta_Thunberg_and_other_climate_activists_Charle-m-84_1633956952783.jpg"], ["Charles\u00a0explained how he had his Aston Martin converted so it runs on English wine and whey from cheese production", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/08/49013071-10079315-Charles_explained_how_he_had_his_Aston_Martin_converted_so_it_ru-a-2_1633938389964.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/13/49024631-10080211-image-a-138_1633957145329.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/13/49024641-10080211-image-m-137_1633957140803.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/13/49024649-10080211-image-m-115_1633957059805.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/13/49024673-10080211-image-a-116_1633957065438.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/13/49024665-10080211-image-m-117_1633957069362.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/13/49024659-10080211-image-m-119_1633957076748.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/13/49024653-10080211-image-m-120_1633957080467.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/13/49024651-10080211-image-m-122_1633957086387.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/13/49024655-10080211-image-m-127_1633957104770.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/13/49024669-10080211-image-m-125_1633957098119.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/13/49024675-10080211-image-a-131_1633957119280.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/13/49024671-10080211-image-m-130_1633957114651.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/13/49024645-10080211-image-m-132_1633957121945.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/13/49024643-10080211-image-m-134_1633957128540.jpg"], ["A highly amused expression on the face of the Prince of Wales at the wheel of his Aston Martin in the 1960s", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/11/14/49025909-10080211-image-a-142_1633957403421.jpg"], ["Pictured: Prince Charles seen driving his Aston Martin back in 2000.

Insulate Britain said 14 protesters were involved in the action, so it is not clear what happened to the other four.\\nAmong these being arrested this morning was\u00a0retired Anglican vicar Reverend Sue Parfitt from Bristol, who was detained for the tenth time in less than seven weeks. It was her third arrest just this week, with the 79-year-old having also\u00a0been detained near Dartford in Kent on Wednesday, and on Bishopsgate in London on Monday.\\nInsulate Britain have brought chaos to motorways and A roads across the capital since mid-September with 146 people taking part in the campaign and 749 arrests made so far - but no one has yet been charged.\\nThe activists were effectively banned from all major roads in England on Monday after a major High Court ruling, and a hearing yesterday was told just three days of their protests had an 'economic cost' of almost \u00a3900,000.\\n\\nToday, an Essex Police spokesman said: 'We have acted quickly to make arrests and minimise disruption on the M25 this morning, Friday 29 October. We were called around 8am this morning with reports that a number of people had been seen walking into the traffic to block both carriageways between junctions 28 and 29.\\n'Officers responded swiftly to remove people from the road and both carriageways were reopened within 30 minutes. We have made a total of ten arrests.'\\n\\nSeptember 13 - 78 Insulate Britain protesters arrested after blocking junctions 3, 6, 14, 20 and 31 of the M25\\nSeptember 15 - More than 50 protesters arrested after targeting junctions 1, 8, 9 and 23 of the M25\\nSeptember 17 - 48 protesters arrested after targeting junctions 3, 9 and 28 of the M25, as well as the M3\\nSeptember 20 - 29 protesters are arrested after blocking the M25 at junctions 4 and 18, as well as the A1\\nSeptember 21 - Protesters risk death by running into moving traffic to block the carriageway near Junction 10. Some 38 arrests are made. National Highways obtains an injunction against further protests on the M25\\nSeptember 22 - Protesters burn copies of the injunction outside the Home Office, blocking the road outside the ministry. No arrests are made\\nSeptember 24 - 39 protesters arrested after blocking roads at three locations in Dover. They are all released under investigation. National Highways obtains a second injunction covering Dover.\\nSeptember 27 - 53 protesters are arrested for blocking a slip road at Junction 14 of the M25. They are all released under investigation.\\nSeptember 28 - National Highways says it is taking 'legal advice' over how to enforce its injunction\\nSeptember 29\u00a0- 27 protesters are arrested for blocking a roundabout at Junction 3 of the M25 on two occasions\\nSeptember 30\u00a0- Protesters return to junction 30 at Thurrock in Essex, and nine are arrested\\nOctober 1:\u00a0The group block the M4 at junction 3, the M1 at junction 1 and M25 at junction 25.

Transport for London gets a High Court injunction to ban them from obstructing traffic in 14 locations in London.\\nOctober 13: Protesters return to the M25 at junction 31 and a nearby industrial estate, with 35 people arrested.\\nOctober 25: Activists target areas around Southwark Bridge, Canary Wharf and Liverpool Street station. Some 53 are arrested.\\nOctober 27: Protesters blockade the A40 in North Acton, West London, and a major roundabout next to the Dartford Crossing in Kent. Kent Police arrested 32 protesters, while the Metropolitan Police detained 17.\\nOctober 29: 14 activists from Insulate Britain walk onto the M25 between junctions 28 and 29 in Essex\\nEssex Police Chief Inspector Lee Devall added: 'Not only will incidents of this nature be frustrating for road users trying to reach their destination, walking into fast moving traffic is extremely dangerous.\\n'I'd like to thank road users today for their patience and understanding. You've helped us to clear the area quickly, to keep people safe, minimise disruption, and keep Essex moving.\\n'Our teams are experienced at dealing with incidents which cause significant disruption and are well prepared for them. We will continue to deal with these incidents robustly.'\\nInsulate Britain spokesman Liam Norton said: 'In a couple of days Cop26 will start in Glasgow and the eyes of the world will be on this country. Britain should be leading the world with radical plans to decarbonise our society.\\n'What we have instead is a budget that is yet another act of treason by this government upon its own people. It is a plan that facilitates mass murder. The citizens of this country should be in open revolt. We need change and we need it quickly.\\n'It is clear that this government has no intention of getting on with the job that they were elected to do. No intention of protecting the country from climate collapse. Our children's futures have been trashed.\\n'Our country sold out. We have been betrayed by the traitors now in power. We ask all decent ordinary people to join us, to rise up and take part in nonviolent civil resistance against tyranny.'\\nThe group, which is an offshot of Extinction Rebellion, has demanded that Boris Johnson 'gets on with the job of insulating Britain's homes which is the best first step to cutting our carbon emissions'.\\nThey claim this will avoid 8,500 deaths due to fuel poverty and help struggling families pay their energy bills this winter.\\nAnother spokesman for the group,\u00a0Tracey Malligan, said: 'I wish I didn't have to cause disruption, but nonviolent civil resistance is the only thing that will get the job done, it is the only thing that has a hope of working within the short time that we have. Within a few years, we will face rising levels of disruption, chaos and tragedy.\\n'Extreme weather, floods and crop failure are just the start. Do you have any idea what happens to society and law and order when the food runs out? It's going to get ugly. Vulnerable elderly folk, families with kids and the disabled will be the first to die.\\n'It's time to stop passively expecting your government to take care of this. They do not have your best interests at heart. It's time to get off the sidelines and join us. It's black and white - we either resist this criminality or we are complicit in it.'\\nIt comes after the High Court was told yesterday that three days of Insulate Britain protests had an 'economic cost' of almost \u00a3900,000. Activists from group have blocked major roads on 16 days since September 13.\\nDemonstrations which took place in different junctions on the M25 and A20 on September 13, 15 and 24, were 'incredibly dangerous' and 'unpredictable', according to National Highways.\\nThe protests, one of which lasted for over seven hours, had an estimated cost of \u00a3883,962, court documents reveal.\\nIt came as part of a written submission by the agency's barrister, who was seeking continuation of an interim injunction at a hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in London yesterday.\\nThe injunction bans the group from obstructing traffic and prevents access to 4,300 miles of motorways and major A-roads.\\nSaira Kabir Sheikh QC argued: 'The estimated, lower bound, costs of these protests on drivers are substantial, with the lowest still causing \u00a320,124 in loss and the most impactful, so far, costing an estimated \u00a3324,107.\\n'This does not account for any costs associated with missed appointments, disruption to manufacturing or retail, missed transportation slots at airports or ports, or the direct cost to police or National Highways of managing the incidents.'\\nMs Sheikh said Duncan Smith, the acting executive director of operations of National Highways, warned in a witness statement it is 'only a matter of time' before a 'serious incident' occurs as the result of the road blockades.\\nA retired Anglican vicar was once again back at the Insulate Britain protests today - marking the tenth time she has been arrested in less than seven weeks.\\nReverend Sue Parfitt, 79, from Bristol, who is also involved with Extinction Rebellion, was taken away from between junctions 28 and 29 of the M25 in Essex today.\\nIt was the third time she has been arrested this week - having also been detained near Dartford in Kent on Wednesday, and\u00a0on\u00a0Bishopsgate in London on Monday.\\nShe has also already been arrested at other protests on the M25 on September 13, 21 and 29, and October 13.\\nInsulate Britain said on Wednesday that Parfitt had been arrested nine times while protesting with the group - making today the tenth time she has been detained.\\nParfitt was fined more than \u00a31,500 in July after she took part in two XR road blockades in Parliament Square and outside a Ministry of Defence site near Bristol.\\nShe went on to say 'there is a real and imminent risk' of larger scale and wider ranging protests from the group which will 'cause significantly more disruption'.\\nMs Sheikh added: 'Further, it is stated that the unpredictable nature of the location of the protests and lack of advance warning together with the increasing public safety risk is preventing NHL (National Highways) from carrying out its statutory duty as the highway authority for the SRN (strategic road network) - particularly in regard to the safety of the travelling public.'\\nAt the end of yesterday's hearing, Mr Justice Lavender adjourned the decision on whether to grant a continuation to the injunction, after Insulate Britain activists argued they were not given enough time to gain legal representation.\\nDr Diana Warner, a member of the group, told the court: 'We are talking about an existential emergency, not about people being late to their jobs or losing a bit of money, we need to change what we're doing for everybody's future.\\n'This is an example of bullying, no other groups are being singled out for doing worse, it's bullying and I hope this court doesn't sanction it.'\\nActivist Mr Norton argued that more time should have been given to the group ahead of the hearing for activists to gain legal representation.\\nAnother member of the group declared: 'This is unfair, it is bullying and a questionable politicisation of the legal system.'\\nMr Justice Lavender told the court: 'What I'm minded to do is adjourn my consideration to a later date to give the defendants a bit more time to gain legal representation.'\\nIt means the order remains in place until a hearing on November 11.\\nMembers of Insulate Britain have also been made subject to three other injunctions granted to National Highways, banning demonstrations on the M25, around the Port of Dover and on major roads around London.\\nMeanwhile, an Insulate Britain crowdfunding page that received more than \u00a360,000 of donations has been removed following accusations of it 'funding criminal activity'.\\nThe fundraising page on Crowdfunder raised a total of \u00a361,970 from 632 contributions in the 29 days since it was created.\\nThe page claims the donations are to assist with 'movement building, non-violent direct action training, back office costs and campaign materials and equipment'.\\nHowever, Crowdfunder has now prevented any further money from being donated to the campaign group.\\nIn a tweet, Insulate Britain claimed the fundraiser was to end at 5pm yesterday 'due to pressure from the media'.\\nHowever, the move follows concerns over the legality of the donations, which appear to be in direct rules for fundraising by funding criminal activity.\\nTom Barr, a Surrey resident delayed by Insulate Britain and who raised concerns about Insulate Britain's funding page to Crowdfunder, said it was 'obviously the funding of crime'.\\nHe added: 'Crowdfunder and the Fundraising Regulator are to be commended for taking prompt action on preventing what was obviously the funding of crime.\\n'But it should not be for ordinary people to make this happen; the taxpayer supports generous salaries for the senior figures in authority that should be acting imaginatively, proactively and robustly to protect the public.'\\nA spokesperson for the Fundraising Regulator said Crowdfunder had not referred the page, but the watchdog did confirm that it is 'in discussion with the platform about the general legal questions that have been raised'.\\nA statement continued: 'Insulate Britain is a campaigning group made up of likeminded individuals and not a registered charity within the legal scope of the Charity Commission, nor does it fall within the Fundraising Regulator's regulatory remit, as it is not a charitable fundraising organisation.\\n'We work with 20 online fundraising platforms registered with us to develop standards and guidance, reflected in the Code of Fundraising Practice.\\n'The Code makes clear the responsibilities of online platforms to ensure that fundraising activity carried out using their sites is lawful, and where it is charitable, complies with the Code of Fundraising Practice.\\n'Crowdfunder has not referred this matter to us as we do not regulate the activity of Insulate Britain and individuals raising money for personal projects, however, we are in discussion with the platform about the general legal questions that have been raised.'", "image": [["Insulate Britain boasted of causing 'major disruption on the M25 in several locations' and are on the M25 in
