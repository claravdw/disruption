Harry and Meghan were said to have hosted a 'relaxed' garden party for Lilibet which her cousins attended. The Lilibet picture was taken by photographer and friend of couple Misan Harriman, who attended the picnic. While the Sussexes were back in the UK for the Platinum Jubilee, the Queen also reportedly met her namesake.", "text": "Harry showed 'incredible cheek' if he asked his grandmother to pose for an official photo with Lilibet in the midst of her four-day Platinum Jubilee and continuing problems with her health, a royal expert told MailOnline today.\\nThe Sussexes\u00a0reportedly wanted their own photographer to capture the Monarch meeting her great-granddaughter Lilibet at Windsor for the first time, but a source claimed they were told 'no chance' because it was a private moment.\\nThe photographer has not been named - but it may be their friend Misan Harriman, who has regularly photographed the Sussexes and even credits himself with getting them together in 2016. He also took the picture of their young daughter on the lawn at Frogmore Cottage as she turned one on Saturday.\\nAngela Levin, Prince Harry\u2019s biographer, told MailOnline: \u2018It is an incredible cheek. It is too incredible for words to have put pressure on his grandmother when she\u2019s struggling to move during four days of celebrations where huge demands are being put on her. It\u2019s even more of a strain when you are 96-years-old. The Jubilee is her last efforts as monarch, and yet Harry asks for time with her when she can\u2019t say no'.\\nHarry and Meghan did not spend any private time with Prince William, Kate, George, Charlotte and Louis during the Jubilee, according to Page Six, and William's family is unlikely to have met Lilibet at all. An insider said the relationship between the brothers remains 'fraught' after the Sussexes' transatlantic 'truth bombs' about the Royal Family on Oprah and friendly podcasts in the US.\\nHowever, Lilibet met Her Majesty 'on more than one occasion' and Prince Charles and Camilla also spent some time with the couple before they returned to California on Sunday, according to Harry and Meghan's friend Omid Scobie.\\nMs Levin said: \u2018They should have stayed for a few days afterwards, spent time with the Queen after her duties had finished, tried to make things right with William. They would have had the time - but they chose to rush in and rush out'. She also suggested that Harry appeared to have 'lost all respect for anybody now', adding: \u2018All his impatience and self destruction is visible. He can\u2019t hide it\u2019.\\nThe pictures of Lilibet and her party were shot by their long-time friend and photographer Misan Harriman, who has shot to fame for his pictures of Black Lives Matter protests in London.\\nHe also takes some credit for helping Harry and Meghan meet, saying: 'Meg reminded me that had I not introduced her to a mutual friend then she wouldn't have met Harry. I'm grateful for whatever small part I played.'\\nThe 45-year-old, who lives in Surrey, met Meghan years ago at a charity event and attended her wedding to Prince Harry at Windsor Castle in May 2018.\\nHe has previously taken photos of other royals, capturing Princess Beatrice's official engagement photo with her then-fianc\u00e9 Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.\\nHe was the first black male photographer to shoot a British Vogue cover and the first to shoot its September issue in its 105-year history.\\nThe activist-themed cover in 2020 featured England footballer Marcus Rashford and model Adwoa Aboah, with Mr Harriman working with a predominantly black team on set.\\nA year before, Meghan guest edited the September issue, which is traditionally the fashion bible's most important of the year. Mr Harriman's work has also featured in Vanity Fair, GQ, Harpers Bazaar and People.\\nThe Nigerian-born photographer has pictured Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts, Cate Blanchett and Olivia Colman, Rihanna, Stormzy and Giorgio Armani.\\nHe is a self-described activist supporting diversity and inclusion in the workplace, as well as a mental health campaigner with an interest in dyslexia.\\nThe photographer has also covered demonstrations against former US President Donald Trump, and protests by Extinction Rebellion and Black Lives Matter in London.\\n\\nLast night Harry and Meghan have given the world a rare glimpse of\u00a0Lilibet - and the grace-and-favour Windsor home they left for\u00a0LA.\\nThe Sussexes released a picture taken as the little girl \u2013 named in tribute to the Queen, whose childhood nickname was Lilibet \u2013 in the grounds of Frogmore Cottage where she celebrated her first birthday at Windsor on Saturday with birthday cake, balloons, party games and picnic snacks.\\nAmong the gifts were apparently a pastel pink VW Beetle ride-on car, \u00a375 from Selfridges, while Sussex supporters donated $100,000 to charity in her honour. Prince Charles may have bought her a swing similar to one he bought for Prince George - after an aide to the Sussexes was seen unloading it from their private jet in Santa Barbara.\\nLast night it was claimed that the\u00a0Queen\u00a0banned Harry and Meghan from having a photographer capture the Monarch met her great-granddaughter Lilibet for the first time.\\nInvestigative journalist Tom Bower, who is working on a biography of the Duchess of Sussex, said: 'Meghan must have been furious when she heard that photographs of their Windsor meeting were forbidden. Banned from the balcony for Trooping the Colour, no shot of her with the Queen in St Paul's and then the final blow was no shot of Lilibet with her great-grandmother. Finally, the Palace is playing a good hand'.\\nHe added: 'The Sussexes\u2019 contract with Netflix is in jeopardy. The veto of photos will fuel the Sussexes\u2019 resentment. Harry\u2019s reprisal could be more revelations in his book billed to be published later this year. This is a dangerous game for both sides'.\\nIn the first public picture of Lilibet since she was a babe-in-arms, it revealed that Her Majesty's great-granddaughter smiling and dressed in a pale blue frock with a white bow in her\u00a0strawberry blonde hair.\\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex invited close friends and family to an \u2018intimate backyard picnic\u2019 while in Britain for the Queen\u2019s Platinum Jubilee celebrations, before jetting home to California on Sunday.\\nThe image of Lilibet sitting happily on the grass\u00a0was\u00a0taken by family friend Mr Harriman, who also shared an image of Meghan holding her daughter inside Frogmore - the home they spent\u00a0\u00a32.4million of taxpayers' money refurbishing before quitting as royals and emigrating.\\nMother and her red-haired daughter were posing with the photographer's blonde wife\u00a0Camilla Holmstroem, a former Goldman Sachs banker turned entrepreneur, and their two daughters, who both had their faces painted, one of the activities laid on for guests. But while Mr Harriman also shared a picture of himself smiling with his eldest child on Instagram and Twitter, there were no pictures of Harry and Archie released.\\nThe 96-year-old is said to have met Harry and Meghan's daughter on Thursday. However, they were allegedly told 'no chance' of an official photo because it was a 'private family meeting',\u00a0The Sun reported. Palace insiders may have worried any photos taken by Harry and Meghan would be shared with TV networks in the US or in Harry's upcoming memoirs.\\nOn Saturday they enjoyed the British summer sunshine to throw a birthday picnic for their daughter's first birthday.\u00a0East London baker Claire Ptak \u2013 who made the couple\u2019s wedding cake in 2018 \u2013 created new treats for the low-key bash. She later shared a picture of a small peony-covered cake that could be the one enjoyed by guests.\\nA spokesman for the couple did not name family members who attended the party, but Zara and Mike Tindall are believed to have made an appearance. But Prince William, Kate, George and Charlotte were in Wales representing the Queen.\\nThe Sussexes left for their California home the following day - on a gas-guzzling private jet - before the grand finale of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee even began on Sunday.\\nMr Harriman took the portraits used by the Sussexes to announce Meghan\u2019s pregnancy with Lilibet in February 2021.\\nThose who are said to have also been at Frogmore Cottage include Zara and Mike Tindall's three children, Mia, eight, Lena, three, and Lucas, one, as well as Savannah, 11, and Isla, 10, daughters of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly.\\nThree-year-old Archie's godfather, Charlie Van Straubenzee, and his brother Tom, godfather to Princess Charlotte, were also invited, it is understood.\\nPhotographer Mr Harriman wrote on her Twitter: 'It was such a privilege to celebrate the first birthday of Lilibet with my family and hers! Joy and face painting all around.'\\nTwitter royal commentator and friend of the Sussexes Omid Scobie said the couple invited close friends and family for an 'intimate backyard picnic' as he posted the picture.\\nBirthday girl Lilibet wore a pretty outfit from a royal-approved children's brand for her first official portrait.\\nHarry and Meghan's daughter was photographed in the \u00a395 frilly top and matching bloomer set from Amaia, one of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's favourite children's brands.\\nIndeed Lilibet's cousins Charlotte, seven, and Louis, four, wore the designer on a total of four occasions over the Platinum Jubilee weekend.\\nIt could have been a gift from uncle William, 39, and auntie Kate, 40, to mark the little one's big day, although the Cambridges are understood to have not attended the garden birthday party.\\nThe\u00a0Angel Set from Amaia is made up of a frilled top with hand smoking at the collar, and a matching bloomer with elasticated legs.\\nIt is described by the brand as a 'chic, delicate and beautiful new style to welcome the awakening season ahead'.\\n\\nMr Scobie added that Harry and Meghan's wedding baker Claire Ptak made a special order for the party.\\nAnd was told by a\u00a0spokesperson for the couple that they 'remain incredibly touched by the countless birthday wishes for their daughter' and have also been 'amazed' to learn that\u00a0$100K (\u00a379,000) was donated in\u00a0Lilibet's honour.\\nThe funds went to World Central Kitchen, a not-for-profit organisation partnered with the couple's Archewell foundation, according to a spokesperson for the Sussexes.\\nThe organisation has provided support in Uvalde, Texas and Ukraine, the spokesperson said.\\nA spokesperson for the couple did not name specific family members who attended the event.\\nA source spoke to The Sun, about the party, saying: 'It was a lovely do and had everything you'd expect from a child's birthday party.\\n'The idea was for it to be very relaxed and casual, with people free to pop in and out as they wished.'\\nThey said that it was a 'nice opportunity' for some of the royal children to meet little Lilibet, with this trip being her first time in the UK.\\nThey added that 'lots of discussion' had been had about the best gifts for the 'milestone' birthday, with a '\u00a375 pink Volkswagen Beetle ride-on toy' proving a popular idea.\\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle left the Platinum Jubilee early - missing the Pageant and the Queen on the balcony yesterday - as they flew back in a private jet to California with luggage that appeared to include a wooden swing set which looked similar to the one\u00a0gifted to William and Kate by Prince Charles.\\nThe California couple released the photograph hours after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge put pictures on social media showing hidden moments from the Jubilee including new pictures of\u00a0Louis with his father, William, and Kate and the children including Princess Charlotte and Prince George waiting in a doorway.\\nThe Queen, Prince Charles and Camilla, Kate Middleton\u00a0and Prince William shared their greetings on social media at the exact same time.\\nThe official Twitter account for the Queen posted: 'Wishing Lilibet a very Happy 1st Birthday!',\u00a0 the\u00a0 account for Prince Charles shared an almost identical message.\\nThe words posted on the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall's social media read: 'Wishing Lilibet a very happy 1st birthday today' along with a cake emoji.\\nIt is also very likely that Prince Charles met his grandchildren. It is understood that he and Camilla met Harry and Meghan privately.\\nIt comes after\u00a0George Northwood, the Duchess' hairdresser, who recently jetted out to the Netherlands to do Meghan's beauty while she attended the Invictus Games with husband, shared a post on Instagram with several images of the Duchess.\\nIn a gushing caption, he posted: 'So nostalgic and wonderful to be reunited Harry, Meghan and their family in the UK.\u00a0Archie has grown to be the cutest, well mannered little boy and Lilibet is just beautiful.'\\nIt comes after Harry and Meghan's entourage were seen\u00a0with a blue child-size scooter and wooden swing set which looked similar to the one\u00a0gifted to William and Kate by Prince Charles.\\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex appear to have come home with presents from their family after they left the Platinum Jubilee before festivities ended on Sunday and missed the Queen on the balcony.\\nA member of their team was seen carrying a wooden swing with rope coming out of it and covered by a blue wrapping as Harry and Meghan's team loaded their luggage from Santa Barbara Airport as their private jet touched down on Sunday evening.\\nAnother assistant was seen reaching for a blue scooter that was sitting on top of a suitcase to put it into an SUV which further indicated that\u00a0Lilibet and Archie, who were not seen during the Jubilee, accompanied their parents.\\nIt was also reported that the Queen did meet her namesake for the first time as the Sussexes joined Her Majesty on Thursday or Friday and was invited to Lilibet's first birthday at Frogmore Cottage.\\nWEDNESDAY\\nThe Sussexes land in Britain on a private jet. The Queen sent three of her own protection officers, her royal Land Rover and a bullet-proof VW people carrier to meet the family at Farnborough Airport, taking them to Frogmore Cottage.\\nTHURSDAY\\nA Range Rover with a modest escort swept them in to Central London and onto Whitehall, where they took up position in the Major General's Office overlooking the parade ground ready for the other royals to arrive.\\nAmong the first to greet them were Princess Beatrice and her husband, Edo, as well as the queen's grandson Peter Phillips.\\nMeghan was seen kissing his elder daughter, Savannah, 11, as his younger daughter, Isla, 10, held Zara and Mike Tindall's younger daughter Lena, almost four.\\nMeghan, wearing a large wide-brimmed navy and white hat, put her finger mysteriously to her lips as the girls mimicked her, laughing.\\nHer husband, Prince Harry, 37, who looked tanned in a lounge suit rather than military uniform, was also seen later entering into the spirit of things, apparently urging Lena to 'shush'.\\nThe couple were later seen chatting to the Queen's cousin, the Duke of Kent, 86, before he left the family gathering to join the monarch at Buckingham Palace, where they took the returning military salute together.\\nFRIDAY\\nThe couple went to St Paul's Cathedral for the morning's service celebrating the Queen.\\nThe couple arrived after the Earl and Countess of Wessex, and their two children, and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie along with their husbands.\\nHarry and Meghan held hands and were smiling broadly as they walked up the steps of the cathedral, while cheers and some boos could be heard from the crowd.\\nThe Duke of Cambridge and his wife Kate sat on the front row alongside Prince Charles and Camilla, who were representing the absent Queen at the Service of Thanksgiving for her 70-year reign.\\nBut Harry and Meghan were placed on the opposite side of the aisle, half-way down a second row of seats, along with other lower-ranking, non-working royals.\\nThere was no chance for the once-close siblings to talk as William, 39, and Kate, 40, were part of the main party.\\nThey arrived after Harry, 37, and Meghan, 40, were seated and left before them in order to attend a post-service reception at the nearby Guildhall.\\nNotably, the California-based Sussexes were the only members of the extensive royal party who were absent from the second event.\\nSATURDAY\\nInstead of attending the concert at Buckingham Palace, Harry and Meghan celebrated their daughter Lilibet's first birthday in Windsor on Saturday with a 'relaxed' birthday party \u2014with royal second cousins invited to the festivities.\\nThe little girl's birthday party was open to Zara and Mike Tindall's three children, Mia, eight, Lena, three, and Lucas, one, as well as Savannah, 11, and Isla, 10, daughters of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly.\\nThe Queen was also rumoured to have been invited -

once was at the Trooping of the Colour and another time at St Paul's Thanksgiving Service - and had no official role during the festivities.\\nIn 2016, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son Prince George was seen playfully enjoying a wooden swing set that bore his parents' names William and Catherine.\\nThe wooden roped-set was a wedding present from Prince Charles to the couple and was installed in their countryside home in Norfolk.\\nIn pictures taken on Sunday of Harry and Meghan's luggage being unloaded as they landed back in\u00a0California yesterday, an assistant was also seen carrying a wooden swing after the couple spent most of their time at their Windsor residence.\\nHarry was pictured looking particularly glum as they landed back in California yesterday - with royal experts saying the sixth in line to the throne appeared angry, anxious and very uncomfortable during 'fleeting glimpses' of him and his wife during the UK visit.\\nOn Thursday they were relegated to the Major General's Office with minor royals for the Trooping the Colour, where they were photographed playfully shushing children.\\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex will have been 'really fed up' at being sidelined by the palace's 'men in suits' they have been so scathing about since quitting in 2020, it has been claimed.\\nAnd as they were met with some booing at their only public appearance at St Paul's on Friday, the couple will have learned that the British public believe being a royal is 'about service, not about self', one critic said.\\nHarry stopped to chat for a few moments with the Archbishop of York at the Thanksgiving Service but was not seen greeting his brother Prince William and his sister-in-law Kate.\\nAnother told MailOnline: 'Their attitude seems to be if we're not centre stage we don't really want to be here'\\nInstead they spent most of their stay at Frogmore Cottage with their children and hosted a 'relaxed' party for Lilibet's first birthday at the Windsor residence, believed to be attended by the one-year-old's British cousins.\\nThe Sussexes arrived back in California at 6pm on Sunday.

Just enough exposure to please the Queen but at the same time so limited to show them that they have been sidelined. Harry's grim expression exposed and confirmed the troubles he now faces. Meghan now faces problems about her status. Netflix are left with a problem: The Sussexes are no longer stars'.\\nHarry's biographer Angela Levin said the couple were probably kept apart from Prince Charles and Prince William because of their ongoing rift and fears any private conversations could end up in Harry's memoirs or on a US TV chat show.\\nShe said: 'I do wonder if they [Harry and Meghan] decided: 'We've had enough of this, let's go early'. I think they were furious. I think they believed they would come back and be welcomed with open arms - but the truth is that the world, and the Royal Family, has moved on without them. They thought that everyone would drop everything for them, but they didn't'.\\nShe added: 'When Harry arrived at St Paul's, he had a growling face. It was there throughout. They were really really fed up. William and Charles have grown closer - they have filled the gap left by Harry, that must be hard for him. I suspect his brother and father will have been worried about speaking to him in private in case it ends up in his memoirs or on US TV'.\\nRoyal author Phil Dampier told MailOnline: 'Their attitude seems to be if we're not centre stage we don't really want to be here.\\n'They must realise they are no longer popular with the general public, and travelling in and out by private jet hardly helps their so-called green credentials.\\n'I'm afraid that all the time Harry is writing a book and making Netflix fly on the wall programmes, Charles and William will not trust him. They would worry that any in depth conversations would be repeated in the media, and so I'm sure they are keeping him at arms length for the time'.\\nAnd after the Sussexes were met with some boos at St Paul's on Friday, commentator Richard Fitzwilliams said: 'This was about the Queen and the future of the monarchy, which they opted out of as senior working royals. Yet they owe their entire profile and contracts to the institution. This fabulous four days showed now strong it is and also how wrong they were to do the interview on Oprah, which caused it to lose support among the young and ethnic minorities and aired when Prince Philip was ill.\\n'The Sussexes should have learnt a lesson over the last few days. When it actually comes to capturing hearts and minds it is about service, not about self'.\\nBy\u00a0Charlie Lankston For Dailymail.com\\nThe photographer behind a new birthday portrait of\u00a0Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's one-year-old daughter Lilibet is the same trusted family friend who took the black-and-white images that the couple used to announce the news that they were pregnant with a second child back in February 2021.\\nMisan Harriman, 45, shared a series of three images taken at a 'casual, intimate backyard picnic' hosted by the Sussexes at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor on Saturday in celebration of their daughter's first birthday, having been invited to attend the small gathering as one of just a handful of select guests, alongside his wife and their two daughters.\\nAmong the images shared by Harriman - who rose to global acclaim when he became the first black male photographer to shoot a British Vogue cover in September 2020 - was a 'candid, spontaneous' shot of Lilibet, which Harry, 37, and Meghan, 40, chose to share with the world to mark their daughter's milestone birthday.\\nAs well as the sweet snap of the birthday girl, the Nigerian-born photographer also shared two other images from the party, including a black-and-white photo of proud mother Meghan holding her daughter in her arms while posing alongside Harriman's wife,\u00a0Camilla Holmstroem, and their two daughters.\\nThe final image saw Harriman posing with one of his daughters in his lap - and showed the little girl sporting some colorful face paint, which the photographer revealed was one of the highlights of the gathering.\\n'It was such a privilege to celebrate the 1st birthday of Lilibet with my family and hers!' he wrote while sharing the trio of images on social media. 'Joy and face painting all around.'\\nThe release of the photos marks something of a full-circle moment for Harriman, who not only helped the couple to announce to the world that they were pregnant with Lilibet, but also played a hand in introducing them in the first place.\\nWhile sharing one of the images from the remote pregnancy shoot - which he shot via iPad from London, while the couple posed in the backyard of their $14 million Montecito mansion - on social media, Harriman, who was a guest at the couple's May 2018 wedding, opened up about the 'small' role he had in bringing the pair together.\\n'Meg, I was there at your wedding to witness this love story begin, and my friend, I am honored to capture it grow,' he wrote at the time. 'Congratulations to The Duke and Duchess of Sussex on this joyous news!'\\nSpeaking to British Vogue following the baby announcement, Harriman added: 'To be asked to help share this absolute joy after such an unimaginable loss and heartache is a marker of true friendship.\\n'Meg reminded me that had I not introduced her to a mutual friend then she wouldn't have met Harry. I'm grateful for whatever small part I played.'\\nAccording to Finding Freedom, a biography written about Meghan and Harry by their journalist friend Omid Scobie, Harriman even enjoyed dinner with the Duchess of Sussex the night before she went on her first date with her future husband, Grazia reports.\\nIt has long been reported that Meghan and Harry were introduced by the Duchess' longtime friend, designer Misha Nonoo, who is based in New York City, but is thought to have been the person who first brought the Sussexes together.\\nWhile confirming the couple's pregnancy news, a spokesperson for the Sussexes shared an insight into the close friendship they have with Harriman, saying at the time: 'The photograph of the Duke and Duchess was was taken by the couple's longtime friend Misan Harriman.

Another snap showed Harry and Harriman sitting alongside one another, while engaged in conversation.\\nIt is not known whether Harriman took part in any filming for the couple's Netflix documentary, Heart of Invictus.\\nAlthough Harriman only became a professional photographer in 2016 following a career in finance, he already boasts an impressive and lengthy resume, having quickly become one of the UK's most prominent snappers.\\nIn fact, he had a hand in helping another member of the royal family announce some special news back in 2019, when Princess Beatrice enlisted him to take an engagement portrait of her and her now-husband\u00a0Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, which they released to the world when they announced their betrothal.\\nIn September 2020, he became the first black male photographer to shoot a British Vogue cover in its then-105-year history.\\nThe activist-themed cover featured England footballer Marcus Rashford and model Adwoa Aboah, with Mr Harriman working with a predominantly black team on set.\\nA year before, the Duchess of Sussex guest edited the September issue, which is traditionally the magazine's most important of the year.\\nHarriman's work has also featured in Vanity Fair, Harpers Bazaar and People Magazine, a biography on his website states.\\nAs well as Meghan, the Nigerian-born photographer has snapped a host of celebrities including actors Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts, Cate Blanchett and Olivia Colman and singer Rihanna.\\nHe is a self-described activist supporting diversity and inclusion in the workplace, as well as a mental health campaigner with an interest in dyslexia.\\nBefore his British Vogue cover, the photographer won praise with a series of photographs that he took during the Black Lives Matter protests in London earlier that same year, with\u00a0many showing profiles of demonstrators holding signs advocating racial justice.\\nSpeaking last August about the positive public reception to many of his BLM pictures, he told CNN: 'Through my lens I have seen the beating heart of London.'\\nMany of the pictures taken at the protests were profiles of activists holding signs advocating racial justice.\\nAmong them was a photograph of England youth hockey player Darcy Bourne outside the US Embassy, holding up a sign reading 'Why is ending racism a debate?'\\nThe photographer, who runs a media company called 'What We Seee', also covered demonstrations against former President Donald Trump and protests by Extinction Rebellion.\\nMore recently, Harriman, who is the chairman of the Southbank Centre in London, was appointed as the head of a collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) created by 'up-and-coming' artists from Africa and Asia.\\nThe collection is funded by the blockchain company the Tezos Foundation's non-profit arm, which donated\u00a0\u00a31 million to be used for the procurement of digital artwork from 'underrepresented' communities, The Art Newspaper\u00a0reported.\\n'The Tezos Foundation Permanent Collection will support and celebrate a new generation of artists that have chosen a smart contract-enabled path to be their true selves,' Harriman said of the project. 'As the first curator of this collection I want to make sure the world sees the diverse voices that are making truly extraordinary work with crypto art. We will be the custodian for this new community of creatives.'", "image": [["Photographer Misan Harriman, the man who took a birthday portrait of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's one-year-old daughter Lilibet while attending her birthday party with wife and two daughters on Saturday, is a close friend of the Sussexes.

There were a lot of sweets out back though, so there was a real sugar high'.\\nMike also praised the Queen for her 'perfect' skit with Paddington, telling listeners: 'I've always said she is very funny'.\\nLouis was undoubtedly one of the stars of the Jubilee.\\nAt one point Mike Tindall leaned over the seat, looked Louis in the eye and indicated he was \u2018watching\u2019 him. That seemed to have the desired effect as the youngster went and spoke to his father before deciding to sit on grandpapa Charles\u2019 lap.\\nLouis was also was seen blowing raspberries, shushing his mother and bouncing up and down on his grandpapa\u2019s lap.\\nThe four-year-old joined brother George, eight, and seven-year-old sister Charlotte in the Royal Box for the two-and-a-half hour parade on Sunday.\\nDressed in a hand-me-down white shirt with blue piping and matching shorts, Louis sat next to his mother Kate, who couldn\u2019t stop smiling at his antics... most of the time.\\nAt one point cheeky Louis thumbed his nose at her and stuck his tongue out. He then put his little hand over her mouth as she told him to stop.\\n24 hours earlier Harry and Meghan threw a birthday party for their daughter Lilibet, who turned one.\\nA spokesman for the couple did not name family members who attended the party, but Zara and Mike Tindall are believed to have made an appearance. The Sussexes left for their California home the following day.\\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children were also invited - but were in Cardiff representing the Queen. It is reported they spent no private time with the Sussexes full stop.\\nHarry and Meghan have given the world a rare glimpse of\u00a0Lilibet - and the grace-and-favour Windsor home they left for\u00a0LA - as it is understood they were banned from photographing the one-year-old meeting\u00a0the Queen\u00a0for the first time.\\nThe Sussexes released a picture taken as the little girl \u2013 named in tribute to the Queen, whose childhood nickname was Lilibet \u2013 in the grounds of Frogmore Cottage where she celebrated her first birthday at Windsor on Saturday with birthday cake, balloons, party games and picnic snacks.\\nAmong the gifts were apparently a pastel pink VW Beetle ride-on car, \u00a375 from Selfridges, while Sussex supporters donated $100,000 to charity in her honour. Prince Charles may have bought her a swing similar to one he bought for Prince George - after an aide to the Sussexes was seen unloading it from their private jet in Santa Barbara.\\nIt was claimed that the\u00a0Queen banned Harry and Meghan from having a photographer capture the Monarch meeting her great-granddaughter Lilibet for the first time. The photographer has not been named - but it may be their friend\u00a0Misan Harriman, who has photographed the Sussexes several times since they became a couple around six years ago.\\nInvestigative journalist Tom Bower, who is working on a biography of the Duchess of Sussex, said: 'Meghan must have been furious when she heard that photographs of their Windsor meeting were forbidden. Banned from the balcony for Trooping the Colour, no shot of her with the Queen in St Paul's and then the final blow was no shot of Lilibet with her great-grandmother. Finally, the Palace is playing a good hand'.\\nHe added: 'The Sussexes\u2019 contract with Netflix is in jeopardy. The veto of photos will fuel the Sussexes\u2019 resentment. Harry\u2019s reprisal could be more revelations in his book billed to be published later this year. This is a dangerous game for both sides'.\\nAngela Levin, Prince Harry\u2019s biographer, told MailOnline: \u2018It is an incredible cheek. It is too incredible for words to have put pressure on his grandmother when she\u2019s struggling to move during four days of celebrations where huge demands are being put on her. It\u2019s even more of a strain when you are 96-years-old. The Jubilee is her last efforts as monarch, and yet Harry asks for time with her when she can\u2019t say no'.\\nHarry and Meghan did not spend any private time with Prince William, Kate, George, Charlotte and Louis during the Jubilee, according to Page Six, and William's family is unlikely to have met Lilibet at all. An insider said the relationship between the brothers remains 'fraught' after the Sussexes' transatlantic 'truth bombs' about the Royal Family on Oprah and friendly podcasts in the US.\\nHowever, Lilibet met Her Majesty 'on more than one occasion' and Prince Charles and Camilla also spent some time with the couple before they returned to California on Sunday, according to Harry and Meghan's friend Omid Scobie.\\nMs Levin said: \u2018They should have stayed for a few days afterwards, spent time with the Queen after her duties had finished, tried to make things right with William. They would have had the time - but they chose to rush in and rush out'. She also suggested that Harry appeared to have 'lost all respect for anybody now', adding: \u2018All his impatience and self destruction is visible. He can\u2019t hide it\u2019.\\nIn the first public picture of Lilibet since she was a babe-in-arms, it revealed that Her Majesty's great-granddaughter smiling and dressed in a pale blue frock with a white bow in her\u00a0strawberry blonde hair.\\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex invited close friends and family to an \u2018intimate backyard picnic\u2019 while in Britain for the Queen\u2019s Platinum Jubilee celebrations, before jetting home to California on Sunday.\\nThe image of Lilibet sitting happily on the grass\u00a0was\u00a0taken by family friend Mr Harriman, who also shared an image of Meghan holding her daughter inside Frogmore - the home they spent\u00a0\u00a32.4million of taxpayers' money refurbishing before quitting as royals and emigrating.\\nMother and her red-haired daughter were posing with the photographer's blonde wife\u00a0Camilla Holmstroem, a former Goldman Sachs banker turned entrepreneur, and their two daughters, who both had their faces painted, one of the activities laid on for guests. But while Mr Harriman also shared a picture of him smiling with his eldest child on Instagram and Twitter, there were no pictures of Harry and Archie released.\\nThe pictures of Lilibet and her party was shot by their long-time friend and photographer Misan Harriman, who has shot to fame for his pictures of Black Lives Matter protests in London.\\nHe also takes some credit for helping Harry and Meghan meet, saying: 'Meg reminded me that had I not introduced her to a mutual friend then she wouldn't have met Harry. I'm grateful for whatever small part I played.'\\nThe 45-year-old, who lives in Surrey, met Meghan years ago at a charity event and attended her wedding to Prince Harry at Windsor Castle in May 2018.\\nHe has previously taken photos of other royals, capturing Princess Beatrice's official engagement photo with her then-fianc\u00e9 Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.\\nHe was the first black male photographer to shoot a British Vogue cover and the first to shoot its September issue in its 105-year history.\\nThe activist-themed cover in 2020 featured England footballer Marcus Rashford and model Adwoa Aboah, with Mr Harriman working with a predominantly black team on set.\\nA year before, Meghan guest edited the September issue, which is traditionally the fashion bible's most important of the year. Mr Harriman's work has also featured in Vanity Fair, GQ, Harpers Bazaar and People.\\nThe Nigerian-born photographer has pictured Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts, Cate Blanchett and Olivia Colman, Rihanna, Stormzy and Giorgio Armani.\\nHe is a self-described activist supporting diversity and inclusion in the workplace, as well as a mental health campaigner with an interest in dyslexia.\\nThe photographer has also covered demonstrations against former US President Donald Trump, and protests by Extinction Rebellion and Black Lives Matter in London.\\n\\nThe 96-year-old is said to have met Harry and Meghan's daughter on Thursday. However, they were allegedly told 'no chance' of an official photo because it was a 'private family meeting',\u00a0The Sun reported. Palace insiders may have worried any photos taken by Harry and Meghan would be shared with TV networks in the US or in Harry's upcoming memoirs.\\nOn Saturday they enjoyed the British summer sunshine to throw a birthday picnic for their daughter's first birthday.\u00a0East London baker Claire Ptak \u2013 who made the couple\u2019s wedding cake in 2018 \u2013 created new treats for the low-key bash. She later shared a picture of a small peony-covered cake that could be the one enjoyed by guests.\\nA spokesman for the couple did not name family members who attended the party, but Zara and Mike Tindall are believed to have made an appearance. But Prince William, Kate, George and Charlotte were in Wales representing the Queen.\\nThe Sussexes left for their California home the following day - on a gas-guzzling private jet - before the grand finale of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee even began on Sunday.\\nMr Harriman took the portraits used by the Sussexes to announce Meghan\u2019s pregnancy with Lilibet in February 2021.\\nThose who are said to have also been at Frogmore Cottage include Zara and Mike Tindall's three children, Mia, eight, Lena, three, and Lucas, one, as well as Savannah, 11, and Isla, 10, daughters of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly.\\nThree-year-old Archie's godfather, Charlie Van Straubenzee, and his brother Tom, godfather to Princess Charlotte, were also invited, it is understood.\\nPhotographer Mr Harriman wrote on her Twitter: 'It was such a privilege to celebrate the first birthday of Lilibet with my family and hers! Joy and face painting all around.'\\nTwitter royal commentator and friend of the Sussexes Omid Scobie said the couple invited close friends and family for an 'intimate backyard picnic' as he posted the picture.\\nMr Scobie added that Harry and Meghan's wedding baker Claire Ptak made a special order for the party.\\nAnd was told by a\u00a0spokesperson for the couple that they 'remain incredibly touched by the countless birthday wishes for their daughter' and have also been 'amazed' to learn that\u00a0$100K (\u00a379,000) was donated in\u00a0Lilibet's honour.\\nThe funds went to World Central Kitchen, a not-for-profit organisation partnered with the couple's Archewell foundation, according to a spokesperson for the Sussexes.\\nThe organisation has provided support in Uvalde, Texas and Ukraine, the spokesperson said.\\nA spokesperson for the couple did not name specific family members who attended the event.\\nA source spoke to The Sun, about the party, saying: 'It was a lovely do and had everything you'd expect from a child's birthday party.\\n'The idea was for it to be very relaxed and casual, with people free to pop in and out as they wished.'\\nThey said that it was a 'nice opportunity' for some of the royal children to meet little Lilibet, with this trip being her first time in the UK.\\nThey added that 'lots of discussion' had been had about the best gifts for the 'milestone' birthday, with a '\u00a375 pink Volkswagen Beetle ride-on toy' proving a popular idea.\\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle left the Platinum Jubilee early - missing the Pageant and the Queen on the balcony yesterday - as they flew back in a private jet to California with luggage that appeared to include a wooden swing set which looked similar to the one\u00a0gifted to William and Kate by Prince Charles.\\nThe California couple released the photograph hours after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge put pictures on social media showing hidden moments from the Jubilee including new pictures of\u00a0Louis with his father, William, and Kate and the children including Princess Charlotte and Prince George waiting in a doorway.\\nThe Queen, Prince Charles and Camilla, Kate Middleton\u00a0and Prince William shared their greetings on social media at the exact same time.\\nThe official Twitter account for the Queen posted: 'Wishing Lilibet a very Happy 1st Birthday!',\u00a0 the\u00a0 account for Prince Charles shared an almost identical message.\\nThe words posted on the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall's social media read: 'Wishing Lilibet a very happy 1st birthday today' along with a cake emoji.\\nIt is also very likely that Prince Charles met his grandchildren. It is understood that he and Camilla met Harry and Meghan privately.\\nIt comes after\u00a0George Northwood, the Duchess' hairdresser, who recently jetted out to the Netherlands to do Meghan's beauty while she attended the Invictus Games with husband, shared a post on Instagram with several images of the Duchess.\\nIn a gushing caption, he posted: 'So nostalgic and wonderful to be reunited Harry, Meghan and their family in the UK.\u00a0Archie has grown to be the cutest, well mannered little boy and Lilibet is just beautiful.'\\nIt comes after Harry and Meghan's entourage were seen\u00a0with a blue child-size scooter and wooden swing set which looked similar to the one\u00a0gifted to William and Kate by Prince Charles.\\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex appear to have come home with presents from their family after they left the Platinum Jubilee before festivities ended on Sunday and missed the Queen on the balcony.\\nA member of their team was seen carrying a wooden swing with rope coming out of it and covered by a blue wrapping as Harry and Meghan's team loaded their luggage from Santa Barbara Airport as their private jet touched down on Sunday evening.\\nAnother assistant was seen reaching for a blue scooter that was sitting on top of a suitcase to put it into an SUV which further indicated that\u00a0Lilibet and Archie, who were not seen during the Jubilee, accompanied their parents.\\nIt was also reported that the Queen did meet her namesake for the first time as the Sussexes joined Her Majesty on Thursday or Friday and was invited to Lilibet's first birthday at Frogmore Cottage.", "image": [["Mike Tindall, Zara Tindall, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and Peter Phillips at St Paul's on Friday - the day after the secret cousins' event not attended by Harry and Meghan", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/06/08/12/58826835-10896165-image-m-24_1654688522755.jpg"], ["Beatrice, Eugenie (left on Sunday) and their husbands (right), as well as Peter Phillips (far left), may have attended the lunch", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/06/08/12/58827339-10896165-image-a-25_1654689205926.jpg"], ["Princess Beatrice (pictured) and Princess Eugenie\u00a0 were joined by Zara Tindall for a long lunch at celebrity favourite Scott's restaurant after Prince Philip's memorial service on Tuesday", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/06/08/12/56048359-10896165-Princess_Beatrice_pictured_and_Princess_Eugenie_were_joined_by_Z-m-20_1654688293688.jpg"], ["Princess Beatrice\u00a0 and Princess Eugenie (pictured) were joined by Zara Tindall for a long lunch at celebrity favourite Scott's restaurant after Prince Philip's memorial service on Tuesday", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/06/08/12/56048361-10896165-Princess_Beatrice_and_Princess_Eugenie_pictured_were_joined_by_Z-a-21_1654688299009.jpg"], ["Behind Prince Louis sat Mike Tindall who entertained the boy with funny faces including a gesture that suggested he had an eye on him.

Nearly 20,000 police officers have been deployed to ensure security at the summit.\\nFor many of the 4,000 protesters though, further action is needed to deal with climate change and inequality.\\n'Today, we are at the G7 again because we realised that nothing has improved... it's been going on for so long, that we are destroying ourselves,' said Lisa Munz, a protestor wearing a hat topped with a stuffed chicken.\\nSaturday's protests in sunny Munich, where the leaders' flights landed before they headed to Elmau, were sponsored by more than 15 organizations including WWF Germany, Oxfam Deutschland, Greenpeace and Bread for the World.\\nOfficers in riot gear shoved protesters in a brief physical confrontation and police said several officers were physically attacked and nine people detained during the day, but the demonstration remained largely peaceful overall, a Reuters witness said.\\nSome 3,000 officers were on duty across the city, Munich police said.\\nThe G7 typically attracts protests by dozens of campaign groups that want to court publicity for their causes and send a message to the Western political elite.\\nThis year, however, protesters may struggle to make their presence visible to the leaders given the especially secluded summit venue, though that could change if protesters attempt to traverse the terrain to get closer to the summit itself, as some have said they plan to do.\\n'The colourful demonstration is a clear sign of how strong the desire of many people is for a fundamentally different policy in the G7 countries,' Oxfam Deutschland said in a statement.\\nAfter the annual G7 summit, some leaders will then travel to Madrid in Spain, where there will be a NATO summit which is likely to also have Russia as its key focus.\\nOn his arrival into Munich yesterday, US president Joe Biden was greeted by a large group of people in traditional dress, as well as Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Soder.\\nAs he stepped off Air Force One two children, also in traditional dress, gave him a bouquet of flowers, while also signed the Golden Book of the Bavarian state government.\\nWhile Russia's invasion of the Ukraine will top the list of concerns, leaders will also discuss other pressing issues such as food insecurity, economic inflation and the concern about China's growing influence.\\nThe G7 leaders intend to announce a ban on importing gold from Russia, according to report.\\nGold is Moscow's second largest export after energy.

The Queen sent three of her own protection officers, her royal Land Rover and a bullet-proof VW people carrier to meet the family at Farnborough Airport, taking them to Frogmore Cottage.\\nTHURSDAY\\nA Range Rover with a modest escort swept them in to Central London and onto Whitehall, where they took up position in the Major General's Office overlooking the parade ground ready for the other royals to arrive.\\nAmong the first to greet them were Princess Beatrice and her husband, Edo, as well as the queen's grandson Peter Phillips.\\nMeghan was seen kissing his elder daughter, Savannah, 11, as his younger daughter, Isla, 10, held Zara and Mike Tindall's younger daughter Lena, almost four.\\nMeghan, wearing a large wide-brimmed navy and white hat, put her finger mysteriously to her lips as the girls mimicked her, laughing.\\nHer husband, Prince Harry, 37, who looked tanned in a lounge suit rather than military uniform, was also seen later entering into the spirit of things, apparently urging Lena to 'shush'.\\nThe couple were later seen chatting to the Queen's cousin, the Duke of Kent, 86, before he left the family gathering to join the monarch at Buckingham Palace, where they took the returning military salute together.\\nFRIDAY\\nThe couple went to St Paul's Cathedral for the morning's service celebrating the Queen.\\nThe couple arrived after the Earl and Countess of Wessex, and their two children, and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie along with their husbands.\\nHarry and Meghan held hands and were smiling broadly as they walked up the steps of the cathedral, while cheers and some boos could be heard from the crowd.\\nThe Duke of Cambridge and his wife Kate sat on the front row alongside Prince Charles and Camilla, who were representing the absent Queen at the Service of Thanksgiving for her 70-year reign.\\nBut Harry and Meghan were placed on the opposite side of the aisle, half-way down a second row of seats, along with other lower-ranking, non-working royals.\\nThere was no chance for the once-close siblings to talk as William, 39, and Kate, 40, were part of the main party.\\nThey arrived after Harry, 37, and Meghan, 40, were seated and left before them in order to attend a post-service reception at the nearby Guildhall.\\nNotably, the California-based Sussexes were the only members of the extensive royal party who were absent from the second event.\\nSATURDAY\\nInstead of attending the concert at Buckingham Palace, Harry and Meghan celebrated their daughter Lilibet's first birthday in Windsor on Saturday with a 'relaxed' birthday party \u2014with royal second cousins invited to the festivities.\\nThe little girl's birthday party was open to Zara and Mike Tindall's three children, Mia, eight, Lena, three, and Lucas, one, as well as Savannah, 11, and Isla, 10, daughters of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly.\\nThe Queen was also rumoured to have been invited - but it is claimed that she met her great-granddaughter for the first time on Thursday or Friday.\\nSUNDAY\\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex and their children reportedly flew out of Farnborough Airport at 1.30pm yesterday, an hour before the Jubilee Pageant began.\\nThe California-based couple are believed to have been driven from Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, where they were staying, at lunchtime.\\nThey landed in the US at around 5pm, LA time.\\n\\nIn 2016, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son Prince George was seen playfully enjoying a wooden swing set that bore his parents' names William and Catherine.\\nThe wooden roped-set was a wedding present from Prince Charles to the couple and was installed in their countryside home in Norfolk.\\nIn pictures taken on Sunday of Harry and Meghan's luggage being unloaded as they landed back in\u00a0California yesterday, an assistant was also seen carrying a wooden swing after the couple spent most of their time at their Windsor residence.\\nHarry was pictured looking particularly glum as they landed back in California yesterday - with royal experts saying the sixth in line to the throne appeared angry, anxious and very uncomfortable during 'fleeting glimpses' of him and his wife during the UK visit.\\nOn Thursday they were relegated to the Major General's Office with minor royals for the Trooping the Colour, where they were photographed playfully shushing children.\\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex will have been 'really fed up' at being sidelined by the palace's 'men in suits' they have been so scathing about since quitting in 2020, it has been claimed.\\nAnd as they were met with some booing at their only public appearance at St Paul's on Friday, the couple will have learned that the British public believe being a royal is 'about service, not about self', one critic said.\\nHarry stopped to chat for a few moments with the Archbishop of York at the Thanksgiving Service but was not seen greeting his brother Prince William and his sister-in-law Kate.\\nAnother told MailOnline: 'Their attitude seems to be if we're not centre stage we don't really want to be here'\\nInstead they spent most of their stay at Frogmore Cottage with their children and hosted a 'relaxed' party for Lilibet's first birthday at the Windsor residence, believed to be attended by the one-year-old's British cousins.\\nThe Sussexes arrived back in California at 6pm on Sunday. Equipment that appeared to be a high chair was seen being offloaded from the plane. Harry was then photographed in the passenger seat of a black Range Rover that had arrived to transport the family home, and looked very serious after almost five days away from the US.\\nThe Duke and Duchess did not attend the Platinum Party and stayed in Windsor alongside the Queen to reportedly watch the concert with Her Majesty.\\nHarry and Meghan then drove, according to The Sun, to Farnborough Airport at 1.30pm, an hour before the Pageant started at 2.30pm and made their way back to California.\\nThis was hours before the Queen - who sources say was 'determined' to bravely overcame her painful mobility issues - returned to Buckingham Palace to personally thank the thousands of well-wishers in the crowd who had turned out to express their own gratitude.\\nShe was flanked by her three heirs - son, Prince Charles, grandson, Prince William, and great-grandson, Prince George - offering a glimpse into the monarchy's future.\\nThe Platinum Jubilee Pageant was an afternoon of entertainment for members of the royal family, who all sat together alongside their siblings and cousins.\\nThe parade told the story of her life, and the nation, with an eccentric, fun and imaginative carnival-like display.\\nAn insider said: 'There was no fanfare, they just went. They didn't stick around for the Platinum Jubilee pageant which is a celebration of Britain and all of its quirks and eccentricities over the Queen's 70 year reign.'\\nBefore the festivities started an aide told The Telegraph: 'The media might try to make them prominent, but in reality they are not going to be playing a prominent role. A line has been drawn.'\\nThe 96-year-old monarch was absent for much of the extended Bank Holiday weekend, after finding the first day enjoyable but tiring, and in a message of thanks acknowledged this but said her 'heart' had been with well-wishers.\\nSurrounded by her family, including Prince Charles, Camilla, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, George, Charlotte and Louis, she was cheered by thousands of well-wishers after stepping on to the balcony following the Platinum Pageant, which told the story of her life, and the nation, with an eccentric, fun and imaginative carnival-like display.\\nSmiling as she acknowledged the spectators, she looked down on The Mall where tens of thousands had waited in hope of seeing her.\\nThe Queen said later in her message: 'When it comes to how to mark seventy years as your Queen, there is no guidebook to follow. It really is a first. But I have been humbled and deeply touched that so many people have taken to the streets to celebrate my Platinum Jubilee.\\n'While I may not have attended every event in person, my heart has been with you all; and I remain committed to serving you to the best of my ability, supported by my family.\\n'I have been inspired by the kindness, joy and kinship that has been so evident in recent days, and I hope this renewed sense of togetherness will be felt for many years to come.\\n'I thank you most sincerely for your good wishes and for the part you have all played in these happy celebrations.'\\nThis was not her only surpises with her Paddington appearance seen as a much welcome appearance by the Queen.\\nA palace aide told the Sun: 'As you saw she likes to spring a few surprises.'\\nAfter the outpouring of public affection during her balcony appearance, the Queen said she was 'humbled and deeply touched' so many people had taken part in marking her 70-year reign.\\nInvestigative journalist Tom Bower, who is working on a biography of Meghan, told MailOnline that the Sussexes had been 'trounced' on their return to the UK.\\nHe said: 'I think Palace officials were unusually skilful in managing the Sussexes. Just enough exposure to please the Queen but at the same time so limited to show them that they have been sidelined. Harry's grim expression exposed and confirmed the troubles he now faces. Meghan now faces problems about her status. Netflix are left with a problem: The Sussexes are no longer stars'.\\nHarry's biographer Angela Levin said the couple were probably kept apart from Prince Charles and Prince William because of their ongoing rift and fears any private conversations could end up in Harry's memoirs or on a US TV chat show.\\nShe said: 'I do wonder if they [Harry and Meghan] decided: 'We've had enough of this, let's go early'. I think they were furious. I think they believed they would come back and be welcomed with open arms - but the truth is that the world, and the Royal Family, has moved on without them. They thought that everyone would drop everything for them, but they didn't'.\\nShe added: 'When Harry arrived at St Paul's, he had a growling face. It was there throughout. They were really really fed up. William and Charles have grown closer - they have filled the gap left by Harry, that must be hard for him. I suspect his brother and father will have been worried about speaking to him in private in case it ends up in his memoirs or on US TV'.\\nRoyal author Phil Dampier told MailOnline: 'Their attitude seems to be if we're not centre stage we don't really want to be here.\\n'They must realise they are no longer popular with the general public, and travelling in and out by private jet hardly helps their so-called green credentials.\\n'I'm afraid that all the time Harry is writing a book and making Netflix fly on the wall programmes, Charles and William will not trust him. They would worry that any in depth conversations would be repeated in the media, and so I'm sure they are keeping him at arms length for the time'.\\nAnd after the Sussexes were met with some boos at St Paul's on Friday, commentator Richard Fitzwilliams said: 'This was about the Queen and the future of the monarchy, which they opted out of as senior working royals. Yet they owe their entire profile and contracts to the institution. This fabulous four days showed now strong it is and also how wrong they were to do the interview on Oprah, which caused it to lose support among the young and ethnic minorities and aired when Prince Philip was ill.\\n'The Sussexes should have learnt a lesson over the last few days. When it actually comes to capturing hearts and minds it is about service, not about self'.\\nBy\u00a0Charlie Lankston For Dailymail.com\\nThe photographer behind a new birthday portrait of\u00a0Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's one-year-old daughter Lilibet is the same trusted family friend who took the black-and-white images that the couple used to announce the news that they were pregnant with a second child back in February 2021.\\nMisan Harriman, 45, shared a series of three images taken at a 'casual, intimate backyard picnic' hosted by the Sussexes at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor on Saturday in celebration of their daughter's first birthday, having been invited to attend the small gathering as one of just a handful of select guests, alongside his wife and their two daughters.\\nAmong the images shared by Harriman - who rose to global acclaim when he became the first black male photographer to shoot a British Vogue cover in September 2020 - was a 'candid, spontaneous' shot of Lilibet, which Harry, 37, and Meghan, 40, chose to share with the world to mark their daughter's milestone birthday.\\nAs well as the sweet snap of the birthday girl, the Nigerian-born photographer also shared two other images from the party, including a black-and-white photo of proud mother Meghan holding her daughter in her arms while posing alongside Harriman's wife,\u00a0Camilla Holmstroem, and their two daughters.\\nThe final image saw Harriman posing with one of his daughters in his lap - and showed the little girl sporting some colorful face paint, which the photographer revealed was one of the highlights of the gathering.\\n'It was such a privilege to celebrate the 1st birthday of Lilibet with my family and hers!' he wrote while sharing the trio of images on social media. 'Joy and face painting all around.'\\nThe release of the photos marks something of a full-circle moment for Harriman, who not only helped the couple to announce to the world that they were pregnant with Lilibet, but also played a hand in introducing them in the first place.\\nWhile sharing one of the images from the remote pregnancy shoot - which he shot via iPad from London, while the couple posed in the backyard of their $14 million Montecito mansion - on social media, Harriman, who was a guest at the couple's May 2018 wedding, opened up about the 'small' role he had in bringing the pair together.\\n'Meg, I was there at your wedding to witness this love story begin, and my friend, I am honored to capture it grow,' he wrote at the time. 'Congratulations to The Duke and Duchess of Sussex on this joyous news!'\\nSpeaking to British Vogue following the baby announcement, Harriman added: 'To be asked to help share this absolute joy after such an unimaginable loss and heartache is a marker of true friendship.\\n'Meg reminded me that had I not introduced her to a mutual friend then she wouldn't have met Harry. I'm grateful for whatever small part I played.'\\nAccording to Finding Freedom, a biography written about Meghan and Harry by their journalist friend Omid Scobie, Harriman even enjoyed dinner with the Duchess of Sussex the night before she went on her first date with her future husband, Grazia reports.\\nIt has long been reported that Meghan and Harry were introduced by the Duchess' longtime friend, designer Misha Nonoo, who is based in New York City, but is thought to have been the person who first brought the Sussexes together.\\nWhile confirming the couple's pregnancy news, a spokesperson for the Sussexes shared an insight into the close friendship they have with Harriman, saying at the time: 'The photograph of the Duke and Duchess was was taken by the couple's longtime friend Misan Harriman. What wonderful news for the Sussexes!!'\\nIt is not known whether Harriman has had the chance to visit the couple's California home in person, however he did pay a visit to Los Angeles earlier this year in order to photograph celebrities on the red carpet at Elton John's Academy Awards party.\\nTaking to Instagram to share some of his images from the event, Harriman revealed that he photographed everyone from Demi Lovato and Ed Harris to Elton's husband David Furnish. Elton and David are longtime friends of Harry and Meghan's, and the latter was actually due to team up with the Duchess of Sussex on an animated series for Netflix, before it was canceled by the streaming company amid cutbacks as a result of plummeting stock prices and dwindling subscriber numbers.\\nThe show - titled Pearl - was understood to be based loosely on Meghan's own childhood, and filmmaker David was going to serve as a producer on the series.\\nNetflix shelled out a $100million to ink a production deal with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in September 2020, however as of yet, the couple has yet to produce any published content for the streaming giant.\\nHowever, the couple have been working on an upcoming documentary about Harry's military sporting event, the Invictus Games, and were trailed by a Netflix camera crew when they traveled to the Netherlands in April in order to host the latest instalment of the competition - which Harriman also attended with the Duke.\\nThe photographer shared several images and videos from his time at the Invictus Games, including several snaps of Harry interacting with veterans and military servicemen and women during the event.\\nOne shot shows the Duke comforting an emotional participant from the UK team, who was seen tearing up while sitting with a Union Jack wrapped around his shoulders. Another snap showed Harry and Harriman sitting alongside one another, while engaged in conversation.\\nIt is not known whether Harriman took part in any filming for the couple's Netflix documentary, Heart of Invictus.\\nAlthough Harriman only became a professional photographer in 2016 following a career in finance, he already boasts an impressive and lengthy resume, having quickly become one of the UK's most prominent snappers.\\nIn fact, he had a hand in helping another member of the royal family announce some special news back in 2019, when Princess Beatrice enlisted him to take an engagement portrait of her and her now-husband\u00a0Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, which they released to the world when they announced their betrothal.\\nIn September 2020, he became the first black male photographer to shoot a British Vogue cover in its then-105-year history.\\nThe activist-themed cover featured England footballer Marcus Rashford and model Adwoa Aboah, with Mr Harriman working with a predominantly black team on set.\\nA year before, the Duchess of Sussex guest edited the September issue, which is traditionally the magazine's most important of the year.\\nHarriman's work has also featured in Vanity Fair, Harpers Bazaar and People Magazine, a biography on his website states.\\nAs well as Meghan, the Nigerian-born photographer has snapped a host of celebrities including actors Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts, Cate Blanchett and Olivia Colman and singer Rihanna.\\nHe is a self-described activist supporting diversity and inclusion in the workplace, as well as a mental health campaigner with an interest in dyslexia.\\nBefore his British Vogue cover, the photographer won praise with a series of photographs that he took during the Black Lives Matter protests in London earlier that same year, with\u00a0many showing profiles of demonstrators holding signs advocating racial justice.\\nSpeaking last August about the positive public reception to many of his BLM pictures, he told CNN: 'Through my lens I have seen the beating heart of London.'\\nMany of the pictures taken at the protests were profiles of activists holding signs advocating racial justice.\\nAmong them was a photograph of England youth hockey player Darcy Bourne outside the US Embassy, holding up a sign reading 'Why is ending racism a debate?'\\nThe photographer, who runs a media company called 'What We Seee', also covered demonstrations against former President Donald Trump and protests by Extinction Rebellion.\\nMore recently, Harriman, who is the chairman of the Southbank Centre in London, was appointed as the head of a collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) created by 'up-and-coming' artists from Africa and Asia.\\nThe collection is funded by the blockchain company the Tezos Foundation's non-profit arm, which donated\u00a0\u00a31 million to be used for the procurement of digital artwork from 'underrepresented' communities, The Art Newspaper\u00a0reported.\\n'The Tezos Foundation Permanent Collection will support and celebrate a new generation of artists that have chosen a smart contract-enabled path to be their true selves,' Harriman said of the project. 'As the first curator of this collection I want to make sure the world sees the diverse voices that are making truly extraordinary work with crypto art. We will be the custodian for this new community of creatives.'\\nThe Queen reportedly banned Harry and Meghan from having a photographer snap the Monarch meeting her great-granddaughter Lilibet for the first time.\\nThe 96-year-old is said to have met Harry and Meghan's daughter on Thursday.\\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex wanted a private photographer to capture the moment their daughter met her namesake, The Sun reported.\\nHowever, they were allegedly told 'no chance' because it was a 'private family meeting'.\\nPalace insiders may have worried any photos taken by Harry and Meghan would be shared with TV networks in the US.\\nThe Sussexes' relationship with the Queen was said to have been damaged when the couple reportedly 'told not asked' the Monarch that their daughter would be called Lilibet, which was Her Majesty's nickname as a child.\\nIt comes as Harry and Meghan were reported to have left the UK and flown back to America an hour before the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebration ended.\\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex were seen for the last time in public on Friday at the Thanksgiving service in St Paul's Cathedral before they flew back home when the Jubilee Pageant started on Sunday.\\nThe couple, who have been largely absent from the fanfare, spent a lot of time at Frogmore Cottage during their stay and hosted a 'relaxed' party for Lilibet's first birthday at the Windsor residence.\\nThey did not attend the Platinum Party and stayed in Windsor alongside the Queen to reportedly watch the concert with Her Majesty.", "image": [["", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/06/06/22/58759607-10890725-image-a-44_1654550959055.jpg"], ["In this picture\u00a0Lilibet is seen in her mother Meghan's arms beside photographer Misan Harriman's family which includes his wife\u00a0Camilla Holmstroem", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], ["In this picture\u00a0Lilibet is seen in her mother Meghan's arms beside photographer Misan Harriman's family which includes his wife\u00a0Camilla Holmstroem", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/06/06/22/58761799-10890725-In_this_picture_Lilibet_is_seen_in_her_mother_Meghan_s_arms_besi-a-55_1654552349055.jpg"], ["In a photograph of Harry at a similar age, also one, he is seen with his trademark reddish locks, similar to Lilibet now (see above), and wearing a blue dungaree and shirt", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], ["In a photograph of Harry at a similar age, also one, he is seen with his trademark reddish locks, similar to Lilibet now (see above), and wearing a blue dungaree and shirt", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/06/06/22/58760721-10890725-In_a_photograph_of_Harry_at_a_similar_age_also_one_he_is_seen_wi-a-45_1654550959057.jpg"], ["Harry and Meghan celebrated their daughter Lilibet's first birthday in Windsor yesterday with a 'relaxed' birthday party \u00bfwith royal second cousins invited to the festivities.

While recognising the right of peaceful protest, Britons took it for granted that they needed to respect the law, as the only thing that stood between civilisation and anarchy.\\nToday, however, there seems to be a new mood in society: a willingness to pick and choose which laws should be obeyed and which should be flagrantly flouted. It is an incredibly dangerous turn for our country to take.\\nLast week in Peckham, South London \u2013 to take only the most recent example \u2013 a mob physically prevented immigration police from arresting a Nigerian man suspected of overstaying his visa.\\nRegardless of the rights or wrongs of the individual case, which would have been fully established while he was in custody, a crowd summoned by text by Left-wing activists deliberately prevented the Metropolitan Police from carrying out their duties. It was done in the name of \u2018community solidarity\u2019, which is agitprop-speak for \u2018mob rule\u2019.\\nThere are plenty of examples around the world of what happens in democratic countries when the police are defied and prevented from carrying out their duties, such as in Portland, Oregon, which defunded its police force and was effectively lawless for several months in 2020-21. Crime rose and deaths from drug abuse \u2013 mainly fentanyl \u2013 increased by 41 per cent in a single year.\\nThe streets of Portland became filled with homeless people; law-abiding people left; property prices collapsed, and the city entered a cycle of despair.\\n\u2018It is predictable, was predicted, and now, unfortunately, is coming to pass in front of our eyes,\u2019 says David Murray of the highly respected Hudson Institute think-tank. \u2018It is a tragedy and a self-inflicted wound.\u2019\\nWhile we are not under threat of police defunding here in Britain \u2013 and, indeed, have a doughty fighter for law and order in our admirably tough Home Secretary Priti Patel \u2013 there undoubtedly is a problem when even members of juries, who used to revere law and order, continually make exceptions, as in the case of the Colston Four in Bristol who were acquitted after vandalising the statue of Edward Colston and throwing it into Bristol harbour. Or the members of Extinction Rebellion who vandalised buildings in the City of London but who likewise walked free.\\nIt emerged last week that a plaque to Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes in Oxford had to be given Grade II listed status after Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries intervened to protect it.\\nBut how long before a mob of vandals destroy that, with the police looking on powerlessly, as happened in Bristol, Peckham, and during the Black Lives Matter demonstration in June 2020, when they simply watched the statue of Winston Churchill being vandalised in Parliament Square?\\nThe assumption all too often is that it is better to witness the breaking of the law rather than intervening to stop it, in the hope the culprits will be arrested later.\\nFor all that might make sense for public order reasons at the time, it sends a disastrous message when on the news and on social media we see the law being deliberately broken and the police seemingly doing nothing about it, which is made even worse when the culprits are freed by juries.\\nAway from the mobs and the coalition of Left-wing organisations that foment this law-breaking for political purposes, there are a large number of Britons who think it outrageous that it should be seen to be condoned. What is very visibly lost on these occasions is the authority \u2013 what used to be called the majesty \u2013 of the law, and that is ultimately more damaging than anything that happens to statues.\\nIt is an important part of Marxist-Leninist revolutionary doctrine that The People should be taught to despise or ignore their country\u2019s laws. That is in part what is going on here, and it must not be allowed to stand.\\nThe law must not be seen to be merely shrugging its shoulders over the case of the gentleman in Peckham; he needs to be treated the same as anyone else who is suspected of overstaying his visa, and not allowed a free pass simply because the immigration police do not want to exacerbate local agitators.\\nAs the old but important line goes: the law must not only be done, it must be seen to be done.\\nThe absurdity of the Extinction Rebellion activists gluing themselves to public highways, being arrested, charged and bailed, and then promptly gluing themselves to the same highway less than four hours later, is also something that has tested the patience of ordinary Britons. If agitators set out deliberately to break the law in this way, and the police have good reason to suspect they will do the same thing again on release, they ought to be kept in police stations for as long as legally possible.\\nThe importance of seeing the law done extends internationally, too. Many Britons are outraged when they see no fewer than three of our British courts \u2013 the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court \u2013 being over-ridden by the European Court of Human Rights over the Rwanda flights.\\nHuman rights are not under any kind of threat in this country, however much the Left would like you to believe they are.\\nWe have an ancient system to protect them, such as habeas corpus stretching back to Magna Carta, and a host of legal precedents that go back centuries.

However, they were allegedly told 'no chance' of an official photo because it was a 'private family meeting'. Palace insiders may have worried any photos taken by Harry and Meghan would be shared with TV networks in the US or in Harry's upcoming memoirs.\\nSpeaking to GB News, Ms Levin, said this image would have been 'very, very valuable', adding: 'They would have used it for Netflix.\u00a0It would give them a kudos that they had her with her great grandmother, you know.'\\nAppearing on the programme, Angela said: 'Harry and Meghan wanted to see the Queen as soon as possible so she saw them on the first day.\\n'She went in, and then they asked if they brought their own photographer and they asked if he could take a picture of the two Lilibets and she said 'no, absolutely not possible'.\\n'Because they would have sold it. \u00a0It would be very valuable, very valuable to them.\\n'Actually the palace was so clever and cunning that they never had a chance to be photographed with any of the senior Royals.\\n'I heard Netflix wanted these pictures of them with the royals, but they were sitting on the right hand side and the rest of them, Camilla, Charles, Catherine and William, on the other side.\\nMs Levin said she believes that after failing to get the images they wanted they 'probably just went off in a rage'.\\n'I think they felt that everyone would drop everything,' she added. 'Even on this amazing day because they were there, they'd come back.\\n'I thought they were like petulant teenagers really. If they didn't get what they wanted, they would leave and they left early.'\\nMs Levin also criticised the pair for compromising their own security, despite suing the government over security concerns.\\n'There he was in a car with black windows, so they were obliged with that so nobody could see who it was, and they opened the windows right down and started waving at the people,' she said.\\n'That was an indication to me that couldn't be out of the spotlight, however, that is very dangerous, someone can throw a bomb in or a load of tomatoes in through the window.\\nShe added: 'And actually, they also flew back on a jet that cost \u00a3160,000 but that's their business, but it put out ten times more carbon emissions than a normal plane would.\\n'We've had them telling us all we mustn't fly, we must be careful\u2026we mustn't let all this carbon emissions carry on - and there they are doing it themselves.'\\nThe Sussexes\u00a0reportedly wanted their own photographer to capture the Monarch meeting her great-granddaughter Lilibet at Windsor for the first time, but a source claimed they were told 'no chance' because it was a private moment.\\nThe photographer has not been named - but it may be their friend Misan Harriman, who has regularly photographed the Sussexes and even credits himself with getting them together in 2016. He also took the picture of their young daughter on the lawn at Frogmore Cottage as she turned one on Saturday.\\nLilibet met Her Majesty 'on more than one occasion' and Prince Charles and Camilla also spent some time with the couple before they returned to California on Sunday, according to Harry and Meghan's friend Omid Scobie.\\nHowever Harry and Meghan did not spend any private time with Prince William, Kate, George, Charlotte and Louis during the Jubilee, according to Page Six, and William's family is unlikely to have met Lilibet at all.\\nAn insider said the relationship between the brothers remains 'fraught' after the Sussexes' transatlantic 'truth bombs' about the Royal Family on Oprah and friendly podcasts in the US.\\nAngela previously told MailOnline Harry showed 'incredible cheek' if he asked his grandmother to pose for an official photo with Lilibet in the midst of her four-day Platinum Jubilee\u00a0and continuing problems with her health.\\nAngela said: \u2018It is an incredible cheek. It is too incredible for words to have put pressure on his grandmother when she\u2019s struggling to move during four days of celebrations where huge demands are being put on her.\\nThe pictures of Lilibet and her party were shot by their long-time friend and photographer Misan Harriman, who has shot to fame for his pictures of Black Lives Matter protests in London.\\nHe also takes some credit for helping Harry and Meghan meet, saying: 'Meg reminded me that had I not introduced her to a mutual friend then she wouldn't have met Harry. I'm grateful for whatever small part I played.'\\nThe 45-year-old, who lives in Surrey, met Meghan years ago at a charity event and attended her wedding to Prince Harry at Windsor Castle in May 2018.\\nHe has previously taken photos of other royals, capturing Princess Beatrice's official engagement photo with her then-fianc\u00e9 Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.\\nHe was the first black male photographer to shoot a British Vogue cover and the first to shoot its September issue in its 105-year history.\\nThe activist-themed cover in 2020 featured England footballer Marcus Rashford and model Adwoa Aboah, with Mr Harriman working with a predominantly black team on set.\\nA year before, Meghan guest edited the September issue, which is traditionally the fashion bible's most important of the year. Mr Harriman's work has also featured in Vanity Fair, GQ, Harpers Bazaar and People.\\nThe Nigerian-born photographer has pictured Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts, Cate Blanchett and Olivia Colman, Rihanna, Stormzy and Giorgio Armani.\\nHe is a self-described activist supporting diversity and inclusion in the workplace, as well as a mental health campaigner with an interest in dyslexia.\\nThe photographer has also covered demonstrations against former US President Donald Trump, and protests by Extinction Rebellion and Black Lives Matter in London.\\n\\n'It\u2019s even more of a strain when you are 96-years-old. The Jubilee is her last efforts as monarch, and yet Harry asks for time with her when she can\u2019t say no'.\\nMs Levin said: \u2018They should have stayed for a few days afterwards, spent time with the Queen after her duties had finished, tried to make things right with William.\\n'They would have had the time - but they chose to rush in and rush out'.\\nShe also suggested that Harry appeared to have 'lost all respect for anybody now', adding: \u2018All his impatience and self destruction is visible. He can\u2019t hide it\u2019.\\nInvestigative journalist Tom Bower, who is working on a biography of the Duchess of Sussex, agreed, saying: 'Meghan must have been furious when she heard that photographs of their Windsor meeting were forbidden.\\n'Banned from the balcony for Trooping the Colour, no shot of her with the Queen in St Paul's and then the final blow was no shot of Lilibet with her great-grandmother. Finally, the Palace is playing a good hand'.\\nHe added: 'The Sussexes\u2019 contract with Netflix is in jeopardy. The veto of photos will fuel the Sussexes\u2019 resentment. Harry\u2019s reprisal could be more revelations in his book billed to be published later this year.

Faced by soaring fuel and power bills for millions, and the rising cost of food, he is said to be jettisoning some of the moves he backed months ago.\\nHis own weakened position after last week's confidence vote in his leadership, which saw 148 of his own MPs demand he quit, gives him less power to see off a powerful group of backbench MP who are against the plans.\\nAmong the plans said to be watered down are a fund to pay farmers for 'rewilding' areas of land, which has been reduced from \u00a3800million to \u00a350million.\\nCabinet minister Michael Gove announced in 2019 that Leon founder Henry Dimbleby was to lead a review into England's food system to ensure it is 'safe, healthy and affordable' for all.\\nThe review also aimed to investigate how the food system could help restore and enhance the natural environment, build a resilient and sustainable agriculture sector and contribute to urban and rural economies.\\nIn his final report, published in 2021, Mr Dimbleby\u00a0called on ministers to make sure the budget for payments for farmers to deliver environmental benefits - such as restoring nature, preventing floods and improving soils - was guaranteed until at least 2029.\\nBut this appeared to have been ignored in the draft White Paper, with the Government instead repeating a pledge to maintain funding levels during the current parliament.\\nIt came as the PM faced the fury of farmers over his post-Brexit food policies.\\nPresident of the National Farmers Union, Minette Batters, told The Observer she met with the Prime Minister on Friday and told him farmers were furious with post-Brexit policies they said left them at a disadvantage against foreign producers.\\nShe said they included farmers in Tiverton and Honiton, where an important byelection is scheduled for June 23.\\n'We want to be eating more British and more local food but again I just ask how,' she told the paper.\\n'It's all very well to have words but it's got to have really meaningful delivery and we aren't seeing that yet in this document.'\\nMr Johnson has faced increasing organised Tory opposition to his multi-billion-pound green energy plans amid a deepening cost of living crisis.\\nThe Net Zero Scrutiny Group (NZSG) of backbenchers warned in February his plans to slash the UK's carbon output by 2050 are misplaced at a time when so many face a struggle with their energy bills.\\nGas prices have fuelled huge increases in costs for families, exacerbated by inflation and a hike to National Insurance contributions introduced in April.\\nThe Prime Minister's Net Zero plans are seen by many backbenchers\u00a0as a sop to his wife Carrie, a noted environmental campaigner. She is a close friend of Zac Goldsmith, a foreign office minister who is also a campaigner on green issues.\\nBut a new team in No10 brought in after the Partygate fiasco is less green and is steering the PM away from their influence, the Sunday Times reported. A source close to the PM's chief of staff, Steve Barclay, told the paper: 'As we're tackling the cost-of-living crisis, ministers are looking at where efficiencies can be made to deliver value for money.'\\nHowever other sources branded the former minister, and adviser David Canzini, 'useful idiots' for the farming lobby.\\nA leaked draft of a food strategy due to be released on Monday has been branded 'half-baked' and 'flatter than a pancake' by campaigners, with particular concern over the apparent rejection of a proposal for tax on sugar and salt.\\nMinisters were accused of concocting a blueprint 'bordering on the preposterous', with the document suggesting they will shun key recommendations from a major review of the food system by Mr Dimbleby.\\nMinisters appear to be moving forward with some of Mr Dimbleby's proposals, including by consulting on mandatory food waste reporting for businesses of a certain size.\\nThe Government has also agreed to trial a Community Eatwell programme, as announced in the Levelling Up White Paper, supporting those on low incomes to improve their diets.\\nThe document said ministers would 'support progress on a wide range of issues, including alternative proteins', after the review urged the Government to 'nudge' consumers into changing their meat-eating habits.\\nBut it suggested sustainable sources of protein do not have to 'displace traditional sectors'.\\nThe paper said the Government would launch a call for evidence to better understand challenges in cutting methane emissions from farm animals such as cattle.\\nIn his review, Mr Dimbleby had set a goal of reducing meat consumption by 30% over 10 years.\\nLouisa Casson, head of food and forests at Greenpeace UK, accused ministers of seemingly 'goading' UK farmers into producing more meat.\\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it did not comment on leaked documents, but a spokesperson added: 'We will be setting out the contents of our ambitious new food strategy in due course.'", "image": [["The PM haschampioned the UK becoming Net Zero in terms of emissions by 2050, under a swing to green advocacy said to have been driven by his third wife, a noted campaigner.", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/06/12/08/58970749-10908407-image-a-1_1655017393507.jpg"], ["Among the plans said to be watered down are a fund to pay farmers for 'rewilding' areas of farmland, which has been reduced from \u00a3800million to \u00a350million.", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/06/12/08/58970817-10908407-image-a-3_1655017931230.jpg"], ["President of the National Farmers Union, Minette Batters, told The Observer she met with the Prime Minister on Friday and told him farmers were furious with post-Brexit policies they said left them at a disadvantage against foreign producers.", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/06/12/08/58970903-10908407-image-a-2_1655017927821.jpg"]], "author": ["David Wilcock, Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "date": "2022-06-12"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10926951/Moment-furious-Italian-motorists-drag-Extinction-Rebellion-activists-road-Rome.html": {"title": "Moment furious Italian motorists drag Extinction Rebellion protesters away to let traffic pass after activists staged a sit-in blockade of one of Rome's busiest roads", "subtitle": "The activists blocked Rome's\u00a0Raccordo - the city's main and very busy ring road.
