I now hope that other councils see sense and do the same. Everybody I speak to is angry about these cycle lanes.'\\nPoliticians have also criticised the scheme, with local Tory MP Felicity Buchan and London Assembly member Tony Devenish both declaring they 'hadn't worked' and instead increased congestion.\\nWill Norman, the Mayor of London's walking and cycling commissioner said the council had blocked three major safety schemes and he would look to recover the money so it could be spent on other areas in the capital.\\nHe told the Evening Standard:\u00a0'They eventually agreed to do this [the Kensington scheme] but they are taking it out before it's even finished. People are dying on these roads. I'm so angry about it. There have been so many collisions and serious injuries that there needs to be a safe route across west London.'\\nThe backlash comes after the council, which initially opened up the lanes to\u00a0encourage visitors back to the High Street, said they would remove the lanes following concerns over congestion, bus journey times and loading.\\nAction Disability Kensington and Chelsea also raised concerns about taxis and cars being unable to drop passengers off safely at pavements.\u00a0In a clip posted to Twitter Ms Buchan, the MP for Kensington, said: 'We're on the verge of Kensington High Street and we've come to see the traffic this morning.\\n'I very much wanted the cycle lane on Kensington High Street to work but unfortunately it just hasn't.\\n'It hasn't worked for pedestrians, it hasn't worked for the elderly, it hasn't worked for the disabled. So very reluctantly, I am asking the council to take out the cycle lane on Kensington High Street.'\\nLondon Assembly Member Mr Devenish added: 'I'd like to thank our residents and residents' associations for working with RBKC to actually look at this scheme.\\n'It was a good idea but I'm afraid it hasn't worked. And now we need to take it out as soon as possible.'\\nIn a joint statement, the politicians also said: 'TfL has always placed RBKC under immense pressure to implement a cycleway scheme, and have threatened to take over Borough roads.\u00a0It is now clear that TfL severely miscalculated the impact of such schemes, which require careful analysis.\\n'We would fully encourage RBKC to explore expanding their highly successful Quietways programme, and we note the success of other measures such as on Portobello Road. Anything that is done to promote active travel must be safe, fair, and balanced for all road users, including the elderly, children, and disabled.\\n'We would like to see the cycle lane remain until the end of the current lockdown on December 2.\\n'However, we believe that this scheme needs to be removed swiftly as soon as we exit lockdown, to allow businesses along the High Street a period of unimpeded business, in the run-up to Christmas, and following the very real difficulties they have faced during the coronavirus restrictions.\\n'Kensington High Street is simply not the correct location, and we must act in the interests of our constituents.'\\nSpeaking on the decision Cllr Johnny Thalassites, Lead Member for Transport, said: 'The cycle lane was a trial scheme to help those hopping on bikes during lockdowns and encourage shoppers to the High Street. Businesses and residents have told us loud and clear that they believe the experiment has not worked. We are listening.\\n'By removing the temporary lanes as lockdown lifts, we hope to help get the High Street moving again and give our local economy the best possible chance of a good December.'\\nTom Frost, Chair of Kensington Business Forum, said: 'We support any project which helps our business community and commend the Council's efforts to design and implement the temporary cycle lanes so quickly under a government directive.\\n'Like many others, we hoped the initiative would be a success. Unfortunately it has not helped our High Street businesses attract customers at a vital time for them, so it is good news that the lanes will be removed.\\n'As a community we must protect our local business operators and the temporary cycle lanes have given us valuable information for potential future schemes.'\\nMichael Stone, Chairman of Kensington and Chelsea Chamber of Trade and Commerce, said: 'The cycle lane in its current form is detrimental to business on Kensington High Street and beyond, and we support its removal.\\n'The pre-Christmas trading period is vital to many businesses and I encourage everyone to stay safe, shop locally, and support your local business community.'", "image": [["During an extraordinary phone call, former BBC journalist Andrew Gilligan claimed that the Prime Minister (pictured in July) had gone 'ballistic' after Kensington and Chelsea Council axed the trial scheme after seven weeks, following a petition signed by 3,000 residents", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/12/06/09/36504398-9022941-image-m-7_1607245737362.jpg"], ["Extinction Rebellion supporters tried to prevent contractors from removing bollards on High Street Kensington which marked out the pop-up cycle lane during the Covid-19 lockdown", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/12/05/22/36488652-9021957-image-a-18_1607207137604.jpg"], ["Cyclists ride down Kensington High Street in protest of closure of cycle lane, December 1", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/12/06/09/36394936-9022941-image-a-5_1607245694308.jpg"], ["The council said it axed the \u00a3300,000 bike lane after scores of complaints from residents, businesses and disability groups", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/12/05/22/36490118-9021957-The_council_said_it_axed_the_300_000_bike_lane_after_scores_of_c-a-33_1607207711172.jpg"], ["Policy adviser\u00a0Andrew Gilligan in January", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/12/06/09/36504402-9022941-image-a-9_1607245832179.jpg"]], "author": ["Abul Taher", "James Heale", "Michael Powell for The Mail on Sunday", "Henry Martin For Mailonline"], "date": "2020-12-06"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9029829/Coca-Cola-worlds-worst-plastic-polluter-year-row-followed-Nestle-PepsiCo.html": {"title": "Coca-Cola is named the world's worst plastic polluter for third year in a row, with Nestle and PepsiCo second and third", "subtitle": "A Break Free From Plastic report found Coca-Cola products at all but four of the 55 sites included in its annual audit of plastic waste.

Since he was killed while on duty, no-one else in the family has had the heart \u2014 or the height \u2014 for this festive tradition.\\nSuch a fan was PC Harper of the season of goodwill that, last year, four months after his death, Lissie, her parents, sister and niece couldn\u2019t even bring themselves to go up into the loft for the 8ft tree. They would have been reminded that Andrew was the only person with the height to balance the star on top.\\nNor could they bear to look at his empty seat at her parents\u2019 kitchen dining table, where he had spent Christmases since he was a teenager, so they opted for a buffet rather than the traditional roast.\\nThis year, mainly for the sake of Lissie\u2019s niece, Ellie, who is four \u2014 children can be great motivators at times of terrible grief \u2014 the tree is back and the family will sit down to turkey with all the trimmings tomorrow.\\nBut the absence of Andrew \u2014 who always wished for a white Christmas, with childlike enthusiasm, and took great joy in making gingerbread houses with Lissie, his childhood sweetheart, and Ellie \u2014 will be no easier to bear.\\n\u2018People think that the sad times, like anniversaries, are hardest but, actually, it\u2019s the supposedly happy times, like Christmas, when it really hits me and I think: \u201cAndrew should be here with me\u201d,\u2019 says Lissie.\\n\u2018So, it\u2019s going to be hard. But, because he loved this time of year \u2014 he was always upbeat and jolly, even more so at Christmas \u2014 I know he would want us to carry on celebrating it without him.\u2019\\nIt\u2019s going to be difficult. This week has been hard. Of course, there have been harder weeks \u2014 truly terrible ones since PC Harper, a Thames Valley police officer, was killed, dragged along a country road for more than a mile by a speeding car. But this week came another blow.\\nWe are sitting at the kitchen table at Lissie\u2019s parents\u2019 home in Oxfordshire, the day after the Court of Appeal refused to increase the jail terms for those who killed her husband.\\nHenry Long, 19, the driver of the speeding getaway car, which dragged PC Harper to his death, was jailed for 16 years in July, after admitting manslaughter.\\nHis accomplices, Jessie Cole and Albert Bowers, both 18, and both passengers in the car to which Andrew became attached when his foot was caught in a strap hanging from the back while questioning the teenagers, suspected of stealing a quad bike, were given 13-year terms after being convicted at the Old Bailey in London of the same charge.\\nLissie, like many others in the country, was appalled by the brevity of the sentences, believing that life imprisonment for taking a precious life, especially that of a man like Andrew who put himself at risk to protect others, would have been more fitting.\\nWhen Attorney General Suella Braverman QC gave her backing for the sentences to be reviewed by three judges sitting at the Court of Appeal, Lissie hoped justice would finally be done.\\nBut it wasn\u2019t to be: \u2018I feel very disappointed, let down by our justice system and the inadequate laws in this country,\u2019 says Lissie, who married Andrew just a month before his death. \u2018Their sentences do not reflect the severity and barbarity of what they did to Andrew.\\n\u2018In a few years they will be out, celebrating Christmas with their families, something that Andrew will never experience again.\\nThe one thing I have to console myself with is that their appeal for a reduction in their over-all sentences was also refused by the appeal judges and I don\u2019t believe these heartless savages are the kind of people likely to exhibit the \u201cgood behaviour\u201d which would see them released early.\\n\u2018While there is no more we can do to increase the sentences in this case, the verdict has spurred me on to fight for Harper\u2019s Law to be introduced, so that no other families of emergency services workers have to fight for justice for their lost loved ones, the way we have.\u2019\\nHarper\u2019s Law, which has the backing of the Police Federation of England and Wales, would mean that anyone guilty of causing the death of a serving emergency worker, while committing a crime, would be auto-matically sentenced to life in prison.\\nAnd since Lissie began campaigning for its introduction in August, even meeting Home Secretary Priti Patel, she has heard from countless frontline workers and their families, grateful that someone is now fighting for greater protection for those whose job it is to run towards danger, while others flee.\\n\u2018Priti Patel is a very passionate lady when it comes to the police and shares my belief that they aren\u2019t given the respect today that they used to be,\u2019 says Lissie.\\n\u2018She told me that what I\u2019m trying to do is admirable and offered her support.\\n\u2018She said, a number of times: \u201cYou know we\u2019re here for you and want to help,\u201d so I will be holding her to that over the coming year. People have told me that getting a change in law is not going to be easy, but my view is that, just because it\u2019s difficult, doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t do it.\u2019\\nWhile there are days when it takes all of Lissie\u2019s strength to keep up the fight \u2014 she is not a woman who craves the spotlight \u2014 her love for Andrew, and a deep desire to honour his memory, spurs her on.\\n\u2018Andrew, too, would feel let down by the justice system,\u2019 she says. \u2018He found it frustrating he and his colleagues worked hard to arrest criminals, for them then to be given inadequate sentences in the courts.\u2019\\nHer husband\u2019s killers, their faces beamed into the Appeal Court at London\u2019s Royal Courts of Justice, via live video link from Belmarsh prison, showed no more remorse, she says, than they had at the initial trial.\\n\u2018They looked bored and as if they couldn\u2019t care less about anything, including Andrew and those of us who loved him,\u2019 says Lissie.\\n\u2018I felt sickened listening to their lawyers pleading their case for reduced sentences.\\n\u2018It\u2019s outrageous they should be given the chance to try to get away with taking a life \u2014 their attempt says a lot about the kind of people they are \u2014 and that we are spending a fortune (the teenagers\u2019 legal aid bill has topped \u00a3720,000) on their legal fees to help them do it.\\n\u2018It\u2019s an extortionate amount of money, but the cost isn\u2019t the most important thing to me, it is the lack of justice for Andrew.\u2019\\nAttending court for the hearing, Lissie wore badges especially made for her, on her coat, bearing Andrew\u2019s name and police shoulder number, one beneath a Union Jack, another in the shape of an epaulette and a third alongside a thin blue line.\\nHer husband had worn a similar badge on his uniform, in honour of a colleague, Simon Caddy, who was killed while off duty by a careless driver, who pleaded guilty and was jailed for his death, in 2017.\\nLissie was in London for a meeting at the Home Office at the time of the Extinction Rebellion protests in September and many of the officers policing the crowds thanked her for keeping up the pressure for Harper\u2019s Law. \u2018I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s down to someone like me, with no experience in politics or the legal system to push for this change,\u2019 she says. \u2018But, so far, no one else has picked up the baton, so I\u2019ve taken it upon myself to do it. Andrew would be proud.\\n\u2018I\u2019ve heard terrible stories from various people in the emergency services who have been attacked, abused and spat at in the course of their duty.\\n\u2018They\u2019re risking everything for us, surely the least we can do is offer some protection, by way of deterrents in law?\u2019\\nLissie\u2019s parents\u2019 home, the hub of the campaign for Harper\u2019s Law, where the family moved when she was ten, her older sister, Kate, 12, and brother, Jake, six, is a warm and welcoming four-bedroom 1950s semi.\\nDownstairs is open-plan, a cosy kitchen diner with a wood-burning stove adjacent to a sitting area, which has two squishy sofas and comfy chairs, all of it perfectly tailored towards a nurturing and harmonious family life.\\nAndrew moved in with Lissie\u2019s family when the couple were 18, two years after they started dating. Although Lissie and Andrew bought and moved into their own house \u2014 a small but idyllic grade-2 listed cottage on the bank of the River Thames, a 15-minute drive away \u2014 in 2016, her parents\u2019 home remained the focal point for family gatherings, and holds many precious memories.\\nIt was here that Lissie retreated, grief-stricken, for months after that fateful knock on her door \u2014 a fellow officer bearing news that her husband was dead, in the early hours of August 16, 2019.\\nAndrew\u2019s terrible death at the hands of the three teenage \u2018thugs\u2019, who appeared ignorant to the gravity of their crime, smirking and clowning around when the jury was dismissed, at their trial earlier this year, devastated the whole family, including little Ellie.\\nShe loved her uncle, looking forward to their trips together to the nearby sweet shop and to feed the ducks.\\nAndrew was very much welcomed into the heart of the family and mum Julie, who works for the Blue Cross charity, and dad Simon, who owns a car restoration company, loved him \u2018like a son\u2019.\\nConsequently, in common with many bereaved families coming to terms with the loss of a loved one, it\u2019s clear that, when talking about Andrew and their grief, none of them wants to add to the still palpable pain of the others.\\nIndeed, while leaning on her mum, and appreciating her infinite moral support, it is only when Julie disappears from the room for a couple of minutes that Lissie, a tiny size 6 and, in stark contrast with \u2018lanky\u2019 Andrew, just 5ft 3in tall, appears relaxed talking about her own suffering.\\nStill, it is hard to imagine how she would have survived the past 16 months \u2014 navigating a global pandemic so soon after losing the love of her life \u2014 without them.\\nGiven the couple were hoping to start a family, not only is it a huge tragedy that Lissie does not have her husband by her side this Christmas, but also there might, by now, have been another grandchild, and a cousin for Ellie, at the table.\\nLissie prefers to direct her energies towards bringing about a change in law in Andrew\u2019s memory, while a holiday with friends, to Budapest, together with weekends away, have all had to be cancelled, due to Covid.\\nThankfully she, her sister and her parents formed a support bubble, meaning Lissie, who runs her business from home, hand-printing original artwork on clothes and accessories, never needed to be alone, even during lockdown.\\nThe five of them will be joined by Julie\u2019s sister on Christmas day when lunch and a walk in the beautiful surrounding countryside, will be followed, in the evening, by games. Card game Dobble and board game Rummikub are particular favourites.\\nOne thing\u2019s for sure, it won\u2019t be long before someone shares a fond memory or anecdote about Andrew \u2014 no doubt something involving his giraffe-like height or insatiable love of food.\\n\u2018He\u2019s still a big part of all our lives and none of us will ever forget him,\u2019 says Lissie.\\n\u2018If we\u2019re successful in getting Harper\u2019s Law enforced, hopefully in 2021, Andrew\u2019s death will not have been in vain and he will be forever remembered by the rest of the country, too.\u2019\\nLissie has donated her fee for this interview to The Gurney Fund (www.gurneyfund.org) and Flint House Police Rehabilitation Centre (flinthouse.co.uk).", "image": [["Lissie Harper (pictured) has revealed the realities of facing the festive season without her husband Andrew who was killed while on duty", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/12/23/18/37199030-9083533-Lissie_Harper_pictured_has_revealed_the_realities_of_facing_the_-m-3_1608749466765.jpg"], ["Lissie (pictured on her wedding day to Andrew) said it is actually the 'supposed happy times' that she misses him the most", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/12/23/19/37199136-9083533-image-a-4_1608750043617.jpg"], ["Lissie's grief touched the nation when her PC husband (pictured together) was dragged to his death by three 'savage' teens", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/12/23/19/37199142-9083533-image-a-5_1608750069408.jpg"], ["It comes after the Court of Appeal refused to increase jail terms for those who killed Andrew (pictured with Lissie)", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/12/23/19/37199154-9083533-image-a-6_1608750109720.jpg"], ["Lissie said about her husband's killers: 'In a few years they'll be out, celebrating Christmas with their families, something Andrew will never experience again'", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/12/23/19/37199152-9083533-image-a-7_1608750133333.jpg"]], "author": ["Helen Carroll for the Daily Mail"], "date": "2020-12-23"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9058963/Heathrow-runway-ahead.html": {"title": "Heathrow third runway will go ahead: Airport wins Supreme Court challenge after High Court had ruled expansion would be illegal", "subtitle": "Heathrow Airport has won Supreme Court challenge over third runway plans.

I now hope that other councils see sense and do the same. Everybody I speak to is angry about these cycle lanes.'\\nPoliticians have also criticised the scheme, with local Tory MP Felicity Buchan and London Assembly member Tony Devenish both declaring they 'hadn't worked' and instead increased congestion.\\nThe Kensington chambers of commerce called the bollards 'detrimental to local businesses', while Action Disability Kensington and Chelsea raised concerns about taxis and cars being unable to drop passengers off safely at pavements.\\nAttendees at today's pro-cycling protest included Roy Turner, 59, a public relations consultant from Finsbury Park.\\nHe said: 'I'm not a cyclist, I'm a person who uses a bike.

Plus, driving around the city is a complete false economy. It's so slow. Cycling is the only option.'\\nMs Buchan, the MP for Kensington, and Greater London Authority member Mr Devenish said in a joint statement: 'TfL has always placed RBKC under immense pressure to implement a cycleway scheme, and have threatened to take over Borough roads. It is now clear that TfL severely miscalculated the impact of such schemes, which require careful analysis.\\n'We would fully encourage RBKC to explore expanding their highly successful Quietways programme, and we note the success of other measures such as on Portobello Road. Anything that is done to promote active travel must be safe, fair, and balanced for all road users, including the elderly, children, and disabled.\\n'We would like to see the cycle lane remain until the end of the current lockdown on December 2.\\n'However, we believe that this scheme needs to be removed swiftly as soon as we exit lockdown, to allow businesses along the High Street a period of unimpeded business, in the run-up to Christmas, and following the very real difficulties they have faced during the coronavirus restrictions.\\n'Kensington High Street is simply not the correct location, and we must act in the interests of our constituents.'\\nSpeaking about the decision, Cllr Johnny Thalassites, Lead Member for Transport, said: 'The cycle lane was a trial scheme to help those hopping on bikes during lockdowns and encourage shoppers to the High Street. Businesses and residents have told us loud and clear that they believe the experiment has not worked. We are listening.\\n'By removing the temporary lanes as lockdown lifts, we hope to help get the High Street moving again and give our local economy the best possible chance of a good December.'\\nTom Frost, Chair of Kensington Business Forum, said: 'We support any project which helps our business community and commend the Council's efforts to design and implement the temporary cycle lanes so quickly under a government directive.\\n'Like many others, we hoped the initiative would be a success. Unfortunately it has not helped our High Street businesses attract customers at a vital time for them, so it is good news that the lanes will be removed.\\n'As a community we must protect our local business operators and the temporary cycle lanes have given us valuable information for potential future schemes.'\\nMichael Stone, Chairman of Kensington and Chelsea Chamber of Trade and Commerce, said: 'The cycle lane in its current form is detrimental to business on Kensington High Street and beyond, and we support its removal.\\n'The pre-Christmas trading period is vital to many businesses and I encourage everyone to stay safe, shop locally, and support your local business community.'\\nWhile Jamie Renton, Chief Executive of Action Disability Kensington and Chelsea, said: 'We have around 1000 disabled members who are experts by experience, so it's good to see the Council listening to our experiences and removing the temporary cycle lanes on Kensington High Street.\\n'We were worried about fewer safe places for cars to drop off disabled passengers and confusing layout changes, especially for visually impaired people. We are keen to support cycling and walking but we need to make sure the High Street is accessible for everyone.'\\nEarlier this month, officials in West Sussex decided to remove the cycle ways that were criticised for causing traffic jams from Crawley, East Grinstead, Horsham, Shoreham and Worthing.\\nIt came as figures showed the number of cyclists in the town plummeted after the initiative was introduced in September.", "image": [["Today dozens pro-cycling protesters from around London pedalled down High Street Kensington in a 'festive joyride' protesting against the route's removal", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/12/01/12/36304118-9005063-Today_dozens_pro_cycling_protesters_from_around_London_pedalled_-m-46_1606824420846.jpg"], ["The High Street Kensington scheme, which was introduced in September, saw the council receive funding from Transport for London's Streetspace fund.
