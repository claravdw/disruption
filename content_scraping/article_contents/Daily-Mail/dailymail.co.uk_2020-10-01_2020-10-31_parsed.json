In 2013 he was found working as a tree surgeon for the Forestry Commission while he lived with his four children including Rory in a yurt alongside 100 hippies, New Age travellers and nudists in a 200-acre stretch of farmland near\u00a0Llandeilo in Carmarthenshire.\\nAnd although hie and\u00a0his children were sleeping on sheepskins in the yurt, he had made sure\u00a0the children do attend the local school each day, even dressed in traditional uniform.\\nThe council used to sent a school bus up the dirt track to the commune to pick them up.\\nHe said then:\u00a0'I've got a family now and a home. I can't run off for weeks at a time. But my views on the environment are just the same.\\n'There is part of me that misses that life. Spending a week up a crane in protest to the construction of Terminal 5 at Heathrow was something special, but I leave it to others at the moment.'\\nBut last year he was out campaigning once more - fined for blockading one of Britain's largest oil refineries in an Extinction Rebellion protest by attaching himself to a concrete block\u00a0at the entrance to the giant Valero plant\u00a0in Pembrokeshire, Wales.\\nHooper was fined \u00a340 after he pleaded guilty at Haverfordwest magistrates' court in October 2019.\\nSwampy and son and the other activists who have now vowed to stay in the trees.\\nThis is despite building pressure from the National Eviction Team (NET), dwindling supplies and the continuing storm that has battered England over the last five days.\\nThe group who have been occupying Jones' Hill Wood have declared part of their intention is to highlight the loss of habitat, and irreversible damage being done by HS2 across the line.\\nLawyers for Nature yesterday released the following statement on Facebook: 'The scenes of destruction as HS2 begins to start felling woodlands along the route are heartbreaking.\\n'Over the last 24 hours, we've been working with independent ecologists who have recorded evidence of rare barbastelle bats in Jones Hill Woods near Wendover.\\n'Further enquiries suggest that HS2 does not have a licence from Natural England to disturb bats at the site, or to damage or destroy their roosts.\\n'Therefore, prima facie, it would spread that further work and/or felling at Jones Hill is illegal.\\n'We have helped to draft letters to both Natural England and HS2 pointing out the legal position and requesting that works at the site are halted pending further investigation into the existence of bats and bat roosts at the woods.\\n'We hope that HS2 will respect and obey the law and that, if not, Natural England will enforce it.\\n'If not, however, we need to bring public pressure to bear to stop wildlife crimes being committed by way of the destruction of this woodland.'\\nDespite the threat of violence and arrests, the remaining activists defending the trees within the threatened land are resolved to stay and they accept any and all consequences of their actions.\\nMark Keir who has been live-streaming from the site, added: 'We're all feeling really good and really strong.\\n'We have lots of people here, both in the tree and on the ground, who every bit as much energy and as much skill for this cause as Swampy does.\\n'Ultimately, we just need to stop this thing, or slow it down so much that people will start really hearing what it is all about.\\n'We know that HS2 have none of the licences they need to work here.\\n'It's such a biodiverse piece of land, it's so beautiful here.\\n'They do not have the bat licence they need, or the dormouse licence, or anything. We're hoping that we can try and stop this on those grounds.\\n'We've had people who have been removed from the tree and taken to a cell - and then come straight back here after being released.

While I can understand the analogy, it seems odd to commit to renewable energy by invoking a country synonymous polluting fossil fuels (not to mention its appalling human rights record).\\nSpeaking as a committed environmentalist - who has spent time as the spokeswoman for the lobby group XR (also known as Extinction Rebellion), I applaud in principle the shift away from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources.\\nBut yesterday\u2019s over-promised and unrealistic pledge to power every home in Britain with wind energy within a decade was, quite frankly, entirely typical of this Government\u2019s muddled thinking when it comes to futureproofing our energy supplies.\\nThe sad truth is that Boris\u2019s crowd-pleasing soundbites cannot deliver what they promise.\\nFor all the invocations of harnessing our gusty shores in some \u2018green revolution\u2019, the proclamations do not stand up to scrutiny.\\nEven if we cranked up wind power provision to the level the Prime Minister proposes (40 gigawatts), this amount would power only about half the homes in Britain - or 7 percent of the total national energy demand.\\nAnd that is only when the turbines are turning - a key point to which we will return shortly.\\nData company Aurora Energy Research has calculated that to reach 40 gigawatts by 2030, one new wind turbine will have to be installed around Britain every weekday for the entirety of the 2020s - at a cost of some \u00a350 billion in capital investment.\\nI do not oppose wind power altogether: it has an important part to play in meeting some of the world\u2019s energy demands.\\nYet over time, like many environmentalists, I have come to realise that while renewable energy can and should be part of the mix, the idea that offshore windfarms can power huge parts of Britain\u2019s national grid are simply not realistic.\\nWind power is widely viewed as the safest, cleanest energy option - and it\u2019s certainly safer and cleaner than gas, coal or oil.\\nThe problem is that it nowhere near as reliable as they are. To put it in the crudest terms: for wind power to work, the wind needs to be blowing \u2013 and when that doesn\u2019t happen, as often occurs in Britain, you need to get your energy from elsewhere.\\nIn this year\u2019s summer heatwave, for example, the UK went from sourcing 20 per cent of its energy from wind to sourcing just four per cent, a gap we plugged with imported, polluting coal.\\nOn one especially windless day in October 2015, Britain\u2019s wind turbines produced almost no electricity at all. The Government was forced to resort to using diesel generators to provide back-up power to the national grid: hardly the \u2018green industrial revolution\u2019 of which Boris now speaks in such boosterish terms.\\nAnyone can understand that a piece of coal is stored energy. Wind power must be harnessed by a turbine and fed into the grid - or lost forever.\\nBatteries, of course, are an option to store that electricity - but they are hugely expensive (one big enough to store Britain\u2019s electricity for a single day would cost an estimated \u00a3300 billion) and themselves rely on polluting mining processes, rare minerals and, of course, they must eventually be disposed of safely, so are hardly \u2018green\u2019.\\nIt is batteries, too, that make wind power increasingly expensive \u2013 unlike most technologies, which typically get cheaper over time. When building wind capacity into the grid it\u2019s essential to include the cost of battery storage, which is currently multiples more expensive than the apparent cost of building wind turbines.\\nMany experts believe that a huge shift to wind power would see Britain\u2019s energy bills soar.\\nWe only need to look to the continent to see that a shift to wind power, whatever the fine intentions behind it, can cause new problems.\\nGermany has spent billions of euros building more than 30,000 wind turbines as part of its much-vaunted bid to cover 65 per cent of its electricity needs with wind by 2030.\\nAll its nuclear power plants are to be closed by 2022 and its coal to be phased out entirely by 2038.\\nFrequently, however, on windless days, Germany has had to turn to high-emissions fossil fuels to make up shortfalls.\\nAnd there, as here, environmental campaigners are deeply concerned about on- and offshore turbines\u2019 impact on wildlife, particularly bats and endangered birds.\\nBirds of prey - which look downwards as they hunt for food and often can\u2019t see directly in the front of them - are especially prone to be killed by turbines\u2019 giant blades.\\nMeanwhile, a modern wind turbine is unlikely to last much longer than 20 years. Though much of its components can be re-sold or recycled, the blades are a challenge: most end up buried in giant landfill sites.\\nAltogether: not quite the cheap, clean, green answer to our problems that Boris seems to think it is.\\nSo - given that it is paramount that we wean ourselves off polluting fossil fuels, what should the Government be doing?\\nThe truth is that we have only one hope of safeguarding our future energy supply.\\nOnly this summer the Government announced that it was investing \u00a340 million to develop the next generation of nuclear energy technology in Britain.\\nCoupled with plans for two new nuclear power stations, Sizewell C in Suffolk and Hinkley Point in Somerset, this looked like positive news for pro-nuclear campaigners such as me.\\nYet the plans have stalled - and were dealt another bitter blow last month with the news that Japanese company Hitachi has pulled out of its commitment to build new power stations on Anglesey and in South Gloucestershire, citing the impact of Covid-19. Thousands of new jobs will no longer be created as a result.\\nAll this has severely hobbled the Government\u2019s famed target to hit \u2018net zero\u2019 emissions by 2050.\\nIn Britain, reliable energy stands on a precipice. Seventies-style energy caps and rations, something none of us want, are inevitable unless ministers urgently prioritise this vital issue.\\nEveryone wants a safer, cleaner world for their children \u2013 and, for that, Government needs to make bold decisions. The shift to wind might look like that - but to me it all too closely seems like hot air.", "image": [["The Prime Minister pledged \u00a3160million to help upgrade ports and factories to ensure that 40 gigawatts of electricity comes from turbines in the sea by the end of the decade", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/07/00/34074176-8812855-The_Prime_Minister_pledged_160million_to_help_upgrade_ports_and_-a-12_1602027698323.jpg"], ["There is currently just under 10.5GW of wind in the seas around the UK, generating around 10 per cent of our electricity", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/07/00/34074174-8812855-There_is_currently_just_under_10_5GW_of_wind_in_the_seas_around_-a-13_1602027710828.jpg"], ["Wind power is widely viewed as the safest, cleanest energy option \u00bf and it's certainly safer and cleaner than gas, coal or oil", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/06/11/34044246-8810031-image-a-16_1601980190643.jpg"]], "author": ["Zion Lights For The Daily Mail"], "date": "2020-10-07"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8867065/Activist-scales-Big-Ben-scaffolding-unfurl-giant-banner.html": {"title": "Rebel with MANY causes: Activist in Spiderman outfit is arrested after scaling Parliament scaffolding to unfurl banner muddled with slogans from XR, BLM, LGBT, All Lives Matter and many more", "subtitle": "Protester scales scaffolding next to Big Ben in Westminster this morning.
