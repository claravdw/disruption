never forget those who sacrificed their lives for our free and open way of life.'\\nWednesday also marks 100 years since the inauguration of the permanent version of Cenotaph memorial on Whitehall in

ceremony to go ahead as the country remains under a blanket second lockdown amid a second wave of coronavirus.\\nMillions of people across the UK instead privately paid their respects from home, while others did head to their local war memorials for socially-distanced ceremonies.\\nPoet Laureate Simon Armitage has written a moving tribute to mark the 100th anniversary of the burial of the Unknown Warrior.\\nHe will read his poem The Bed \u2013 the title is a metaphor for the anonymous soldier's grave \u2013 at a televised Armistice Day service at Westminster Abbey today.\\nMr Armitage, 57, said yesterday: 'The poem tells the story of the retrieval and repatriation of the body of the Unknown Warrior from the battlefields of World War I to his grave in Westminster Abbey.\\n'I was very struck by the ritualistic detail that had gone into the making of the coffin and the tomb, and thought of it as a bed, somewhere to rest in peace.\\n'His anonymity makes him everyone's son, everyone's responsibility, and the poem concludes that we owe him his rest, because our restfulness was paid for with his life.'\\nAt the Cenotaph, around 10,000 veterans would normally pay their respects, but this year there were just 26 because of the risks presented by Covid-19.\\nAs well as Mr Johnson and Labour leader Sir Keir, former Prime Ministers David Cameron, Tony Blair and Theresa May, Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Home Secretary Priti Patel and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey were among the politicians in attendance.\\nAs the clock struck 11am, Mr Johnson, Prince Charles, Prince William and other members of Britain's elite marked the two-minute silence before laying their wreaths.\\nThe Queen watched on from the royal box at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office as Prince Charles laid a wreath on her behalf.\\nThe Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Edward and his wife the Countess of Wessex, along with Princess Anne, the Princess Royale, were also in attendance.\\nLast week, the Queen made an unannounced visit to Westminster Abbey to commemorate the the centenary of the burial of the Unknown Warrior\\nAccording to the Court Circular, she was greeted by the Dean of Westminster Abbey, The Very Reverend David Hoyle.\\nThe monarch looked sombre in a black ensemble, typically only worn while in mourning, attending a funeral, or for Remembrance Day and Remembrance Sunday services.\\nThe Court Circular for November 4 read: 'The Queen this morning commemorated the Centenary of the burial of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey, London SW1, and was received at the Great West Door by the Dean of Westminster (the Very Reverend Dr David Hoyle).'\\nThe Queen has carried out only a handful of engagements since March and is expected to keep a low profile over the next month as she and\u00a0the Duke of Edinburgh, 99, spend lockdown together at Windsor Castle.\\nThe Duchess of Cornwall also carried out an engagement at Westminster Abbey before the Queen, standing in for Prince Harry to visit the Field of Remembrance.\\nShe then stood in front of crosses from the Graves of the Unknown as the Dean offered prayers, before solemnly laying her own cross of remembrance and bowing her head in reflection.\\nA bugler played the Last Post, followed by a two-minute silence, and then Exhortation to Remembrance, as Big Ben chimed at 2pm.\\nAfterwards the duchess toured the 308 plots filled with more than 60,000 crosses and symbols of all faiths, laid by staff and volunteers, with Surgeon Rear Admiral Lionel Jarvis, President of The Poppy Factory.\\nRemembrance Sunday services, which are traditionally part of communal worship, cannot go ahead as planned on November 8 due to lockdown restrictions\\nHowever, rather than being banned entirely the Government has set out a series of guidelines for local authorities and faith leaders hoping to hold the services.\\nOn June 28, 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand - the nephew of Emperor Franz Joseph and heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire - was shot dead.\\nHe was assassinated in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, along with his Serbian wife, Sophie, on June 28, 1914.\\n\\nEventually killed by 19-year-old Gavrilo Princip, the couple had earlier that day been attacked by another man who threw a grenade at their car.\\nArchduke Ferdinand was shot in the neck, while his wife was hit in the abdomen.\\nThe assassination started a domino effect which led to the outbreak of the First World War a month later.\\nPrincip and others wanted Bosnia to become part of Serbia. \u00a0Austria-Hungary, like many in countries around the world, blamed the Serbian government for the attack and hoped to use the incident as justification for settling the question of Slav nationalism once and for all.\\nAs Russia supported Serbia, an Austro-Hungarian declaration of war was delayed until its leaders received assurances from German leader Kaiser Wilhelm that Germany would support their cause in the event of a Russian intervention\u2013which would likely involve Russia\u2019s ally, France, and possibly Britain as well.\\nOn July 28, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, and the tenuous peace between Europe\u2019s great powers collapsed.\\nWithin a week, Russia, Belgium, France, Great Britain and Serbia had lined up against Austria-Hungary and Germany, and the First World War had begun.\\nArtillery units of Austria-Hungary began to rain down shells on Belgrade, the Serbian capital - the very first shots of World War One.\\nThat attack was to start a chain reaction that, within weeks, embroiled all of the world's great powers into a global war which mobilised more than 70 million military personnel.\\nThe Great War - as it was soon to be known - was the first military conflict to be fought on an industrial scale.\\nBut the technological advances that led to increases in the lethality of weapons were not matched by changes in strategy, with both sides resorting to practically suicidal human wave attacks.\\nBy 1918, the powers of Central Europe were exhausted by fighting.\\nA final last-ditch offensive along the Western Front by Germany was successfully repelled and, as U.S. forces began to enter the trenches, the Allies staged a series of successful advances, forcing the enemy to surrender on November 11.", "image": [["Prince Charles

Judith Woods meets accidental comedian Meggie Foster\\nThere\u2019s no denying that some folks have had a better pandemic than others. Bike shops. Deliveroo. Loo roll brands. And Meggie Foster on TikTok.\\nYou probably don\u2019t recognise her name \u2013 yet. But make no mistake, this impish comic actress from the Home Counties is on a trajectory to stardom. And all thanks to Meggie\u2019s hilarious lip-synching satires of celebrities and politicians such as Gemma Collins and Boris Johnson. The most-watched example is her uproarious take on the infamous October 2019 interview between ITV news presenter Tom Bradby and Meghan while she and Prince Harry were on a trip to Africa. As the Duchess of Sussex earnestly speaks about the need to thrive, not just survive, Meggie\u2019s Bradby starts playing violin while a querulously sincere Meghan dabs her tears away with a \u00a350 note. Wicked. Funny. Wickedly funny.\\nOver these past months 27-year-old Meggie has been an irreverent breath of fresh air. \u2018Priti Patel followed me on Twitter after I did her,\u2019 says Meggie. \u2018I was thrilled. But when I did another one, she unfollowed me. I\u2019m not sure what that was all about.\u2019 I do, Meggie. It\u2019s all about the way you portray our sternly joyless Home Secretary as a hard-drinking, chain-smoking, off-the-scale party girl. \u2018I was listening to a speech she gave and I thought she was slurring her words slightly, so I had some fun with that,\u2019 beams Meggie.\\nIn its original incarnation lip-synching is the art of pretending to sing a song when in fact the performer is just moving their lips. But latterly it has become a perfect medium for satire. Frankly nothing hoists a politician by their own petard better than their actual words playfully presented on a public platter with a great big dollop of side-eye mockery.\\nMeggie\u2019s own extravagant side-eye (see also her expressive eye-roll and long, meaningful blink) is a wondrous thing to witness. We are chatting via Zoom but by sheer force of her personality it\u2019s as if she\u2019s not only in the room but pinning me to the wall. \u2018What is fascinating is that you find yourself listening more intently to what the politicians are saying when their words are lip-synched,\u2019 says Meggie. She\u2019s right. So no wonder some MPs are warier than others. In Diane Does Digits, Meggie seizes upon former Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott\u2019s disastrously innumerate radio interview about police recruitment. By way of illustration, we see Meggie trying and failing to get her sums right with the help of a nursery numbers book, a can of M&S mojito and an abacus.\\nIn Bedtime with Boris, she plays Boris Johnson reading George Orwell\u2019s 1984 to Theresa May. The audio is taken from the Prime Minister\u2019s \u2018Stay alert\u2019 announcement, and his predecessor\u2019s infamous speech about social care during the 2017 general election. A set-to between Labour\u2019s Caroline Flint and Emily Thornberry depicts them as stroppy teenagers.\\nFrom Greta Thunberg to Love Island contestants, all Meggie\u2019s targets are instantly recognisable, and since lockdown her social media following has rocketed.\\nSo just who is the woman behind the parody? Meggie was born and raised in Oxfordshire by her businessman father Piers and mother Catherine. She loved performing in school productions and professed an early desire to go to drama school. \u2018My parents did exactly what parents are supposed to do and told me to get a proper degree first on the assumption the acting phase would pass,\u2019 says Meggie. \u2018So I did a business studies degree at King\u2019s College London then announced I was going to drama school.\u2019\\nShe did a master\u2019s at University of the Arts in London then found herself working as a receptionist, a waitress and an estate agent. \u2018Last year I decided I needed to give it one last big push,\u2019 Meggie says. \u2018I left my job and spent six months concentrating on auditions before I somehow ended up selling software to beauty salons. I was furloughed in lockdown and went back home to live with my parents where I was unbelievably bored.\u2019\\nA friend suggested she download TikTok and post something to fill the time. Meggie decided to do it properly. She bought a professional lighting kit and rifled through her parents\u2019 wardrobes for costumes.\\nThe first video she posted on Twitter was a lip-synch of a news interview of an Extinction Rebellion protester that had garnered a lot of interest. \u2018There was such a juxtaposition between this woman\u2019s terribly rude four-letter words and her super-posh accent that it was irresistible,\u2019 says Meggie. \u2018I filmed it in the grandest room in the house and posted it on Twitter. Social media went crazy and the comedian Dom Joly commented on it.\u2019 That\u2019s an understatement. The Trigger Happy TV star\u2019s words were, \u2018If I was an agent, I\u2019d be signing her up on the spot.\u2019 And it turns out, an agent was. \u2018Catherine Tate\u2019s agent got in touch, which is unbelievable,\u2019 she says.\\nThose who follow American politics on social media may already know of Meggie\u2019s US counterpart, the author and comedian Sarah Cooper, whose Donald Trump lip-synchs are hugely popular. \u2018Trump is now her territory so he\u2019s off limits to me.

Day and Remembrance Sunday services.\\nThe Court Circular for November 4 read: 'The Queen this morning commemorated the Centenary of the burial of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey, London SW1, and was received at the Great West Door by the Dean of Westminster (the Very Reverend Dr David Hoyle).'\\nThe Queen has carried out only a handful of engagements since March and is expected to keep a low profile over the next month as she and\u00a0the Duke of Edinburgh, 99, spend lockdown together at Windsor Castle.\\nThe Duchess of Cornwall also carried out an engagement at Westminster Abbey before the Queen, standing in for Prince Harry to visit the Field of Remembrance.\\nShe then stood in front of crosses from the Graves of the Unknown as the Dean offered prayers, before solemnly laying her own cross of remembrance and bowing her head in reflection.\\nA bugler played the Last Post, followed by a two-minute silence, and then Exhortation to Remembrance, as Big Ben chimed at 2pm.\\nAfterwards the duchess toured the 308 plots filled with more than 60,000 crosses and symbols of all faiths, laid by staff and volunteers, with Surgeon Rear Admiral Lionel Jarvis, President of The Poppy Factory.\\nRemembrance Sunday services, which are traditionally part of communal worship, cannot go ahead as planned on November 8 due to lockdown restrictions.\\nHowever, rather than being

earth protectors around the world'.\\nThe four women and two men said they hoped to drop off the delivery in person so it came across 'like a friend to a friend wanting to reach him where he lives'.\\nBut they were told by Sir\u00a0David's daughter Susan he would not open the door amid the coronavirus pandemic.\\nIn September protesters blockaded printworks for national newspapers, with one of the demonstrators claiming the\u00a0British media was worse than the Nazis.\\nMore than 100 protesters targeted Newsprinters printing works at Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, and Knowsley, near Liverpool, blocking newspapers from leaving.\\nDonnachadh McCarthy, 61, emerged as one of the leading figures in the group, and justified the attack by saying: 'This is like World War Two and you guys [the newspapers] are on the other side. That is how we see it.\\n'It puts you on the side of the existential threat. It is a different existential threat but it is a bigger one than the Nazis.'\\n'Extinction Rebellion is an international movement that uses non-violent civil disobedience in an attempt to halt mass extinction and the risk of social collapse,' according to its website's 'about' page.\\nThe environmentalist protest group held its first demonstration in Parliament Square on\u00a0October 31, 2018.\\nThe worldwide group want to change the structure of power to take authority away from central governments.\\nIts website reads: 'We understand that we must self-organise to meet our own needs, which in the context of Extinction Rebellion means that we are working to equalise power by disrupting the usual pillars of power that govern our lives.'\\nSince 2018 members of the group have gathered at London Fashion Week, the House of Commons and various other locations around central London.\\nOn the morning of Wednesday, April 17, 2019, two activists climbed onto the roof of a Docklands Light Railway train at Canary Wharf station whilst another glued himself to the side, spreading disruption to railway services.\\nThe following day the three activists were charged with obstructing trains. After pleading not guilty they were sent to jail for four weeks, with no bail, whilst awaiting their next hearing.\\nOn February 17 2020, Extinction Rebellion members of the University of Cambridge dug up a patch of lawn outside Trinity College, as a protest against its investment in oil and gas companies.

Jobsworths say it will take SEVEN YEARS and \u00a3140m to repair Hammersmith Bridge. Now the engineer son of a D-Day hero has an ingenious \u00a315m quick-fix", "subtitle": ".", "text": "Night is falling on Chiswick Mall as hundreds of schoolchildren and their parents suddenly encounter a fresh challenge: the route home is now under water.\\nEver since the total closure of Hammersmith Bridge three months ago, after years of neglect, life has been increasingly complicated in West London. Many people now have to walk or cycle for miles to find an alternative crossing over the Thames.\\nAnd, as they have learned in recent days, there are spells when the adjacent roads and towpaths disappear at high tide.\\nClemmie Watkins and Henry Cowell, both 13, bravely try their luck, pedalling headlong into the filthy brown water, dodging driftwood and a floating rubbish bag before riding on into the night. Moments later, Maya, ten, and Lewis, six, arrive with their mother, Tara.\\nThey have no option but to try the alternative route \u2014 via the A4 and the Hogarth roundabout, gateway to the M4. It\u2019s no place for a six-year-old on a bike. But it is better than a flood in the dark...\\nThe saga of Hammersmith Bridge is now much more than a local or even regional failure. The fate of the grand Victorian landmark is international news, mocked by the New York Times as a parable of post-Brexit British uselessness.\\nHaving just been told that the bridge will not be back to normal until \u2014 wait for it \u2014 2027, incredulous residents are demanding answers. Why take at least six years to mend what its designer Sir Joseph Bazalgette built in three? How come the repair bill has gone from \u00a340 million to \u00a3140 million in a year?\\nHowever, there is one short-term quick-fix at hand. It comes courtesy of a London family with a long and distinguished track record in such things.\\nIt is a temporary road bridge, one which could be assembled for a tenth of the repair bill (\u00a315 million) in a fraction of the time (three months) \u2014 and would soon repay its costs with a small toll. It is designed by the marine engineer Tim Beckett and his team at Beckett Rankine, builders of harbours, bridges and piers from Tyneside to Qatar.\\nThe newly updated computer model (shown here for the first time) involves two lanes of road traffic and a separate cantilevered pedestrian lane. Mr Beckett points out that the prefabricated steel spans are ready to go and would sit on a series of 20 steel piles driven ten metres deep into the bed of the Thames by a floating jack-up rig (at a rate of two piles per day).\\nA similar bridge has recently carried highway traffic above a huge building site in South London. \u2018It\u2019s a quick, technical solution and it allows the engineers to work on the main bridge for as long as it takes,\u2019 he says. Industry experts such as the New Civil Engineer magazine are impressed. But the jobsworths are not.\\nFor the main obstacle to this proposal is not the tide, but naysaying bureaucrats. They have dismissed the scheme, saying that it will end up \u2018mired\u2019 in local complaints. Tim Beckett simply replies that hundreds of thousands of people are now \u2018mired\u2019 in the worst congestion in living memory.\\nHis family firm has form in this regard. You\u2019ll find Tim\u2019s father, the late Allan Beckett, immortalised in bronze above the Normandy beaches in Arromanches, where the French credit him with one of history\u2019s great triumphs. In 1944, it was the vast floating harbour \u2014 codename: Mulberry \u2014 which stopped the D-Day invasion being driven back into the sea.\\nAnd it was Major Allan Beckett of the Royal Engineers \u2014 and his invention of the \u2018kite\u2019 anchor \u2014 that meant the entire venture survived the storms of June 1944.\\nIn other words, the Beckett plan has to be worth a proper look. The Mail has learned that Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps has stepped in personally.\\nHammersmith Bridge is a study in civic incompetence going back years. Road traffic was stopped last year following cracks in the ironwork. The discovery of much bigger cracks this August set off instant alarm bells.\\nOvernight, all movement over or under the bridge was banned for fear of imminent collapse. For the first time since the Great Freeze of 1814, the upper Thames is now sealed off from the sea. Right now, the Varsity Boat Race would be illegal.\\nAfter weeks of dithering by the three local authorities involved, the Transport Secretary announced that a national \u2018task force\u2019 would take charge. The argument is no longer about who is to blame but about what happens next. We are told that, come spring, there will be a ferry service between Hammersmith to the north and Barnes to the south.\\nLocal councillors also want the Government to fund a new footbridge. This would cost much the same as Mr Beckett\u2019s road bridge, could take longer to build and will not alleviate congestion elsewhere. Fewer cars in Hammersmith simply increases pollution in Chiswick, Putney and Fulham.\\nTask force officials have suggested that, in a year or two, pedestrians may be allowed back on the existing bridge, even as repairs continue.\\nThe locals are open to any solution, as long as it\u2019s quick. \u2018The first iron bridge in the world was built in this country,\u2019 sighs Peter Snow, \u2018and look where we are now.\u2019\\nThe historian and broadcaster, who lives south of the river, explains that the regular routines of thousands of people \u2014 going to school, going to the doctor, going to work \u2014 now require militarystyle planning.\\nHe wants to see a ferry as quickly as possible, pointing to a clever plan for a floating platform shuttling between two floating piers.\\nWhat used to be a 200-yard walk across the Thames has become a five-mile round trip. Buses are slow and, thanks to the pandemic, seating is reduced.\\n\u2018I can stand by the bridge and look across at my doctor on the opposite bank. But just you try getting there,\u2019 says Muriel Seaman, 92, who lives in Barnes with husband Joe, 96, a Fleet Air Arm war veteran. They regard themselves as lucky. \u2018Think of those on their own, cut off from friends and family,\u2019 she says. \u2018Some will have popped their clogs by the time this bridge is mended.\u2019\\nVideo footage of the latest meeting between all the key \u2018stakeholders\u2019 is a heart-sinker. The bridge belongs to the Labour-run Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham which, having failed to maintain it, says it cannot afford to repair it.\\nMost of the 16,000 pedestrians and 24,000 bus passengers who depend on it are from the borough of Richmond. Three years ago, Richmond council even offered to buy it for a pound (Hammersmith did not respond), but it certainly doesn\u2019t want it now.\\nThe bridge is also the main daily route into town for 22,000 vehicles from all over the south. Keeping the capital moving is the job of Transport for London and the city\u2019s Labour Mayor, Sadiq Khan.\\nAll of the above say they are skint (though Hammersmith council has managed to lend many millions to other councils over the past two years). All insist that the British taxpayer must solve this problem.\\nAt the public meeting, it fell to the Tory Transport Minister, Baroness Vere, to remind them that if they want a bail-out, they will all have to make a contribution \u2014 and be less obstructive. Let\u2019s hope so. For most of this long meeting consisted of officials listing all the things that cannot be done.\\nResidents were told that the old bridge cannot be replaced, for fear of the \u2018heritage lobby\u2019. The councils can\u2019t install winter lighting along muddy towpaths because it will upset bats. Hammersmith can\u2019t pay for a ferry because it is already funding bridge security, and so on.\\nThe most telling moment, however, was when residents asked about the Beckett Rankine plan for a temporary road bridge. Cue much shaking of heads. The leader of Richmond council, Gareth Roberts, said it was \u2018chasing rainbows\u2019 and would invite Extinction Rebellion protests.\\nThe senior task force civil servant warned that a feasibility study would somehow cost a whopping \u00a3500,000. Here was an inertia masterclass straight out of Yes Minister.\\nBut the tide could be turning. The Tory candidate for Mayor of London, Shaun Bailey, tells me that, if elected, he will \u2018make it a priority to build a temporary road bridge\u2019.\\nI now learn that the Tory MP for neighbouring Chelsea and Fulham, Greg Hands, a keen fan of the scheme, convened a top-level meeting last week with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and senior officials to hear the Beckett plan in full.\\nThe contents of the meeting remain private, though Mr Hands tells me it was \u2018very constructive\u2019. But Hammersmith still insists that Tim Beckett\u2019s plan is not an option.\\nHowever, Richmond\u2019s Gareth Roberts tells me that, while he is not a fan of the scheme, he would not stand in its way. As for the alleged \u00a3500,000 cost of a feasibility study, one expert calls that figure \u2018bonkers\u2019.\\nI\u2019d say the odds are still against Mr Beckett\u2019s scheme. But at least it is now a runner. And if ministers need convincing, they should take just a short walk from Hammersmith to the Hogarth roundabout.\\nThere, they\u2019ll see a famous flyover on steel stilts which merges traffic from the M3 with that from the M4. It was meant to be only a temporary fix back in 1968 but is still going strong. Its designer: Allan Beckett.\\nOn engineering matters, who would you trust?
