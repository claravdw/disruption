Queen Victoria Street.\\nMr Bailey told the crowd: 'We are outside Cargill today, a company, in good part, behind a massive expansion of broiler units and animal slaughter across Herefordshire and Shropshire, making those counties the capital of chicken abuse.'\\nThe crowd booed Cargill, before Tim urged those gathered to 'go vegan'.\\nThe activists, who are calling the planned two weeks of

take part in the Extinction Rebellion protest following the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report.\\nLiam Geary Baulch, who helped launch Extinction Rebellion in 2018, said the

Claim that by treating Brazil as a friendly future trading partner the DIT is condoning deforestation, human rights abuses against Indigenous people & a climate catastrophe.\u00a0It will have horrific consequences for everyone across the planet.'\\nPolice have so far arrested 118 people during Extinction Rebellion's protests across the capital this week, with more expected over the next two weeks.\\nActivists claim more people have been inspired to take part in the Extinction Rebellion protest following the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report.\\nLiam Geary Baulch, who helped launch Extinction Rebellion in 2018, said the group saw a jump in donations from people after the document was published on August 9.\\nThe report gave a stark warning and outlined that human-caused climate change, which has pushed up global temperatures by 1.1C, is driving weather and climate extremes in every region across the world.\\nMr Baulch said: 'Last week \u00a3100,000 was raised in crowdfunding in just 24 hours ahead of the two weeks of protests in London.\\n'With the IPCC report just coming out, a lot of people have been reignited with the urgency of taking action on the climate and ecological emergency and are aware that, now it's more safe for everyone to come to London [due to coronavirus restrictions being eased].'\\nHe added: 'We are again running groups all over the country and people are being encouraged to come down to London... When they're here they are all involved with different kinds of protests, all with the aim of like really inviting people to get in and come and talk with us.'\\nTory MP Ms Aiken was among many fed up with the group, as she slammed them for making life miserable for Londoners living and commuting where they are.\\nShe told LBC: 'The disruption to local people and to businesses is immeasurable. I was told last night by Westminster City Council that last time XR were here for two weeks they cleared 120 tonnes of rubbish left behind\\n'That added \u00a350,000 worth to their costs and this is local people's council tax. I want to point out that obviously Westminster and the City of London are considered very wealthy areas.\\n'But I want to remind people that actually it's not all about wealth. There are major areas of deprivation in central London, 25 per cent of homes are social rented and the wealthy who live here have gone for the summer.\\n'So it's those who live here permanently, who can't escape who are living with this so called beautiful chaos. I can't tell you the number of calls and emails and letters I've had from really worried local people.\\n'It's just gone too far. I think nobody denies we are in a climate emergency and I also don't think we can deny that this government is probably the most progressive green one we've ever had.'\\nShe continued: 'This government has made tackling climate change a priority and it may not be as quick as XR wish but life is never as simple as we want it to be.\\n'We've got to bring the people with us and ensure the great British public do their bit. We've all got to do our bit but if we act like XR are doing now I think it's putting people off the cause and it's going to have the reverse.\\n'This concerns me because we have got to work together. But also the police resources that are going into policing this protest for the next fortnight is shocking.'\\nAbout 40 people were arrested at XR protests yesterday as the group's action in central London continued. The Metropolitan Police said the arrests were for a variety of offences. There were 10 Sunday and 52 Monday.\\nEarlier on Tuesday, the climate protest group said two women had been arrested for spray painting the floor outside the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC).\\nAn elderly woman who lay in the road was carried off by four policemen and appeared to be arrested, with XR protesters suggesting this was for obstruction.\\nOther demonstrators lay in front of a banner saying 'Government in bed with climate criminals'.\\nAfter gathering at Parliament Square, demonstrators ran towards slow-moving traffic on Whitehall for the second day of its planned 12-day mass protest.\\nXR kicked off its Impossible Rebellion protests on Monday when demonstrators blocked roads, including around Trafalgar Square, as they demanded the Government end investment in fossil fuels.\\nOn Sunday, ahead of the official start of the action, protesters gathered at Guildhall in central London, with three scaling the entrance to the building.\\nA crowd of about 200 people sang and cheered as the protesters sprayed red paint over the walls of the building and unfurled a banner reading 'co-liberation freedom together'.\\nThe Met said a 'significant' operation would be in place for the protests over the bank holiday weekend but also acknowledged the activists' 'important cause'.\\nThe demonstrations continue next week, when the activists will protest against the links between 'big finance, fossil fuels and the fossil of politics that is Westminster'.\\nThere is more than a touch of the Prince Harrys about Dr Gail Bradbrook, co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, the middle-class eco-worrier movement currently reducing swathes of the capital to a standstill via the medium of, among other horrors, interpretive dance.\\nLike Harry, Bradbrook is passionate about climate change. Also like Harry, she seems to subscribe to a 'Do what I say not what I do' school of activism. While Harry hops home to California from the polo in Colorado on a mate's private jet, Ms Bradbrook ferries her kids to rugger and football in a diesel car \u2014 the worst-offending kind of vehicle in terms of emissions.\\nHer excuse is that she can't afford an electric car \u2014 and that there are no buses available where she lives on a Sunday.\\nA plight one would not be entirely unsympathetic towards \u2014 were it not for the fact that she and her followers are busy making life a misery for countless ordinary people who don't have the luxury of being able to take a fortnight off work to dress up as shamans and play the bongos in Covent Garden.\\nAlso like Harry, Dr Bradbrook likes to take exotic holidays which require long-haul flights: in 2016, she flew 11,000 miles to Costa Rica. Apparently, this was necessary for health reasons. The health of whom, one wonders? Certainly not her beloved planet Earth.\\nTo be honest, though, bad as it is, the hypocrisy isn't even the worst of it. Extinction Rebellion are, in many respects, the perfect example of a 'first world' protest movement. Many come from a place of privilege. One so innate they're not even aware of it.\\nThis is not only brought into sharp relief by the seemingly infinite number of girls called Chloe with cut-glass accents gushing excitedly about 'climate emergency, yah' as though it were a new type of designer handbag while gluing themselves to the railings outside daddy's office in the City, but in recent days far more poignantly, by contrast to a more immediate 'emergency' unfolding before our very eyes in Afghanistan.\\nWhile Bradbrook and her chums waste everyone's time and money staging their tedious interventions, waving their dreamcatchers and subjecting us all to their terrible dad-dancing, thousands of women and children are facing the grimmest imaginable fate at the hands of the Taliban.\\nFor many of us, watching the unfolding nightmare has put so many of our own petty daily concerns into perspective.\\nAgainst such a backdrop, the antics of XR seem not only puerile, but also utterly misplaced.\\nFor a start, they're preaching to the converted. Britain has long been at the forefront of dealing with climate change, even though we already have some of the lowest rates of pollution in the world.\\nBut then the truth is the future of the planet is not really why XR stage their stunts. If it were, they would not be targeting Trafalgar Square or harassing civil servants. They would be camped outside the Chinese Embassy, or picketing officials in Bejing, trying to persuade the world's single largest producer of greenhouse gases \u2014 27 per cent \u2014 to scale back.\\nBut they're never going to do that because . . . well, I doubt whether Dr Bradbrook or any of the lovely Chloes would have the stomach for a Chinese jail.\\nNo, XR do what they do because they're a group of virtue-signalling, attention-seeking busybodies with nothing better to do all day than harass people who actually have to work for a living.\\nThe fact that the country \u2014 and the authorities \u2014 tolerate them with such good humour is yet another reminder of what a civilised place Britain really is and how lucky we are to live here.", "image": [["Police form a ring around a pink structure the demonstrators erected on Wednesday afternoon in Oxford Circus, central London", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/25/17/47085823-9925553-Police_form_a_ring_around_a_pink_structure_the_demonstrators_ere-a-25_1629910478349.jpg"], ["The bright pink construction had a protester on top of it as police officers from the Met formed a ring around it this afternoon", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/25/17/47085827-9925553-The_bright_pink_construction_had_a_protester_on_top_of_it_as_pol-a-26_1629910478350.jpg"], ["Metropolitan Police officers fail to stop the demonstrators from erecting the structure in the middle of the highway, forcing traffic to divert", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/25/17/47088195-9925553-Metropolitan_Police_officers_fail_to_stop_the_demonstrators_from-a-27_1629910478352.jpg"], ["Officers were pictured standing around in a circle around the structure - not intervening - as the protest clogged up Oxford Circus", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/25/18/47094367-9925553-image-a-72_1629911040960.jpg"], ["A JCB crane was parked nearby which police failed to use as it remained on the back of a trailer.

Some might say she only got the lucrative modelling jobs because she was Madonna's daughter but perhaps I am being harsh.\\nNow 24, Lourdes has certainly inherited the best of genes from her mother and father Carlos Leon, along with developing a tattooed street style all of her own.\\nHowever even her greatest fans, of which I am sure there are many, must admit there is nothing obviously special about her; surely nothing that would attract the attention of global brands such as Marc Jacobs and Stella McCartney, for whom she has fronted advertising campaigns \u2014 except the lustre of her celebrity lineage.\\n'People think I'm this talentless rich kid who's had everything given to her, but I'm not,' Lourdes told American Vogue magazine this month.\\nI hear you, Sis!\\nWhile it warms the very cockles of my heart to see this independent role model get out there in the world under her own fragrant steam, I prefer the more honest approach of someone like TV presenter and fitness expert Chloe Madeley, who admits that having famous parents \u2014 in this case the broadcasters Richard and Judy \u2014boosted her career.\\n'I was accused of nepotism,' she said recently. 'It was true, therefore it hurt.'\\nIt is so rare for anyone who benefits from celebrity nepotism to actually admit their success might be due to others. It's a touchy subject! Their egos can't take it!\\nYet one might have hoped that the kind of oily favouritism from which Lourdes Leon and her ilk so richly benefit would have little place in the post-Covid world; a world in which society might look less favourably upon the antics of the unjustly entitled who gobble up all the access and opportunity denied to others, and hopefully re-evaluates what is truly important, perhaps even bringing down the curtain on vapid celebrity endorsements once and for all.\\nBut don't hold your breath.\\nLourdes is busy, busy, busy promoting the wares of Swarovski, a jewellery company which sells everything from \u00a320 pineapple-shaped magnets to a \u00a31,700 rhodium-plated necklace called the Hyperbola Choker.\\nThere are payment plans in place for those young men and women who, unlike Lourdes, cannot afford the crystal cuffs or the stud earrings or the sparkly \u00a3900 evening bags and, really, nothing screams inclusivity like the words 'four interest-free payments of \u00a3225'.\\nAnd judging by their announcement, Swarovski clearly think they have signed up some potential Nobel Prize winner onto their books.\\n'Model, actress, linguist, academic and activist, Lourdes personifies the spirit of Swarovski,' gushes the company, which is a hyperbola choker all of its own.\\nActress? She was in one of her mum's pop videos, but that hardly makes her Meryl Streep.\\nThey could have added cosmetic-ologist (Lourdes launched her own make-up range when she was 14) and couturier (she designed a range of clothes a few years later).\\nYet she failed to make much of an impact with either, despite them being the kind of golden chances which many far more talented young people can only dream about.\\nThis month Lourdes is on the cover of American Vogue, even if it is no secret that she \u2014 like King Kong and Julia Roberts before her \u2014 is most famous for not shaving her armpits. 'Yeah, come at me, Bro,' is apparently what she says to anyone who criticises her intimate grooming choices. It's the pits, it really is.\\nTo me, hairy Lourdes sums up the very, very worst of celebrity nepotism \u2014 this lucrative knotweed that chokes the talent pool across all the glamour professions in particular, making it difficult for ordinary kids without connections or a famous name to stick even a crampon in the foothills of fame and fortune.\\nAt a time when so many youngsters are struggling with pandemic-stunted lives and careers through no fault of their own, you would think that someone like Madonna's daughter might be more tactful and discreet about her success.\\nBut Lourdes clearly didn't get the empathy memo, Bro.\\nOf course, she is not the only SAD (Sons And Daughters of famous people) to trade on her name. Look at the Jaggers. In no special order of merit we have Jade (jewellery designer), James (musician), Georgia (model), Gabriel (model) and Elizabeth (model).\\nMeanwhile lacklustre photographer Brooklyn Beckham is the human embodiment of parental hope over prodigal no-talent expectation, while over in Hollywood, Destry Spielberg, daughter of director Steven, has hit back at claims she has benefited from nepotism.\\n'I have literally been trying to get into the film industry for over seven years now. No matter who you are, it is hard,' wailed Destry, who is shortly to direct a film starring Hopper Penn (son of Sean) with a script written by Owen King (son of Stephen). Elsewhere, Demi Moore appeared in a swimwear campaign with three of her daughters, while Spandau Ballet member Martin Kemp's Marks & Spencer advertising campaign with son Roman has helped make his boy a millionaire at 28.\\nBradley Walsh has been making television programmes with his son Barney, while Maya Hawke, daughter of Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke, was cast in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. Would they really have got there without their famous names or is each one an opportunity denied to someone else?\\nNext month 19-year-old Tilly Ramsay, daughter of chef Gordon, will appear as a contestant on this year's Strictly Come Dancing after working her way up the hard way, via appearances on her dad's television programmes.\\nAll these showbiz liberals, these darlings of democracy who are so keen on equality, fraternity and individual rights \u2014 except when it comes to prioritising and pushing their own kids down the flume of fame.\\nNepotism gets you through the door, say the SADS, but it rarely allows you to stay if you don't prove yourself.\\nWhat they don't understand is that getting through the door in the first place is everything. It is all that matters.\\nWhat you do on the other side is up to you, but how sad if all you can do is flog a lot of overpriced diamante brooches.\\nCan it really be true that ABBA are to go on tour again? Only with digitalised holograms onstage instead of the real thing?\\nWhy bother? Last year I went to see the Whitney Houston hologram tour when it had its world premiere in Sheffield.\\nWhitney once hoped that no matter what people took from her, they couldn't take away her dignity. Some hope.\\nDue to the mawkish wonders of technology, the long dead star was dug up and reborn as an unconvincing effigy shuffling about onstage like a silvery ghost.\\nI'd hate to see ABBA degrade themselves in a similar manner.\\nWouldn't it be better to remember them in their glory, not as a soulless, money- spinning mirage?\\nWho could live without it, I ask in all honesty? I know that I can.\\nThe death of Charlie Watts seems oddly shocking, for it always felt like The Rolling Stones would go on for ever. And even if they didn't, then rock solid Charlie would.\\nHe was always the most virtuous Stone, the clean-living one with the happy marriage, the folded shirts in the leather suitcases he took on tour, the impeccable suits, the well-ordered life.\\nIt feels like a pillar of society has come crashing down \u2014 and that even the Stones might roll no more. Not so fast. We hear that the Stones will resume their tour next month as planned with a replacement drummer. The show must go on! Is that admirable \u2014 or just lucrative? You never know with Mick.\\nTroglodyte news.\u00a0Women's feet have spread out because they have been wearing flat shoes during the pandemic. Now thousands of us are finding it painful to squeeze our tootsies back into the tyranny of high heels \u2014 and are refusing to return to the hell of the totter.\\nPerhaps we should throw the shoes away and wear the shoe boxes instead? Meanwhile, Elle Seline will become the first woman to compete in the Ms Great Britain pageant without wearing make-up.\\nWho says we are not making strides \u2014 but backwards or forwards? It is hard to say.\\nOh no! Not the Sussexes again. Each week I hope and pray that Meghan and Harry will somehow manage to stay out of the headlines, cleave to the shadows, enjoy the sacred privacy they claim to love so much \u2014 instead of invading it themselves with such startling regularity.\\nWhy? Because I don't want to keep writing about this pair of prestige-soaked, perma-peeved eco-smugs; this couple dishing it out while lapping it up in their luxury Californian mansion.\\nI don't want them inside my head, bleating about climate change and poverty, while taking private jets to play polo. Still!\\nOr complaining about how hard done by they are; this poor pair of ragamuffins having to scratch out a living on the millions Mummy Diana left in her will.\\nWithout that inheritance, H&M 'wouldn't have survived' they claim. That is rather like saying a squid wouldn't have survived without water, a bird couldn't fly without the wind beneath its wings, or a Prince couldn't bounce without a lovely trampoline of cash beneath his feet.\\nYou mean Harry had to dip into his inheritance? Please God, no! Anything but that.\\nWithin their fortress of privilege, Harry and Meghan have yet to scrape an acquaintance with the economics of the real world, no matter how much we all wish they would.\\nWe also learn this week that they considered naming the royal who made the allegedly racist remark before Archie's birth.\\nHowever, Meghan told Oprah (keep up) that revealing it would be 'damaging to them'.\\nIf the couple were so upset by this event \u2014 which they have turned into an international incident \u2014 why wouldn't they stand by their principles and get the whole thing out in the open?\\nInstead, they chose the sneaky way, like they always do.\\nTheirs is the route of the unauthorised biography and the unofficial spokesman, they prefer to leave it to others to pump out their propaganda while they get to maintain a discreet silence. It's utterly shameless.\\nAnd all of it aimed at rocking the monarchy they say they love, but seem to want to destroy.\\nAfghans who worked for the West fear retribution and let us hope that those who wish are given safe passage to the UK.\\nYet as the situation deteriorates into unthinkable scenes, I am admiring of those who are staying behind \u2014 like Mahbooba Seraj, founder of the Afghan Women's Network. She says she has responsibilities to hundreds of young women in her care, and no one is going to force her to leave her country.\\nThere are other equally worried but resolute women who have little choice but to stay, including a head teacher who says she has 700 girls to take care of and that this is not the time to leave the country, it's the time to stay.\\nKeep them in your thoughts and prayers.\\nIt's infuriating that the police and the Government do so little to stop Extinction Rebellion protesters bringing London to a standstill.\\nWhere are the vats of hot oil and the tumbrils when you need them? Not to mention the refreshing draughts of tear gas and some good old fashioned kettling. I jest!\\nBut perhaps the more pertinent question is this \u2014 why did protester Laura Amherst feel she had to take her bra off?\\nThe 31-year-old student danced topless near Oxford Circus this week to 'draw attention to climate change'. Well she was certainly drawing attention to something, and it wasn't the greater refinement of womankind. Many males who until that moment had very little interest in climate change issues hugely appreciated Laura's efforts \u2014 while many expert bystanders seemed to be of the opinion that Laura was showing off a new boob job.\\nCan this be true? Can a woman with cosmetically enhanced curves really call herself a vegan eco-warrior, as Laura does? Breast implants are made of medical grade silicone which is tested on animals, is not biodegradable and takes up to 500 years to decompose, longer if left in a landfill.\\nPerhaps the truth is that lovely Laura has been blessed by nature and simply wants to give something back.", "image": [["Such wonderful news that Madonna\u2019s daughter Lourdes has become the face of \u2018inclusion and diversity\u2019 for Swarovski crystals!", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/27/00/47151289-9931177-image-m-21_1630018812620.jpg"], ["Now 24, Lourdes has certainly inherited the best of genes from her mother and father Carlos Leon, along with developing a tattooed street style all of her own", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/23/47151281-9931177-image-a-19_1630018767804.jpg"], ["For who could be more representative of inclusion and diversity than the daughter of a pop star multi-millionairess whose progress through life so far could arguably be represented by the hot knife of nepotism slicing through a pat of privilege butter over and over again", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/27/09/47151287-9931177-For_who_could_be_more_representative_of_inclusion_and_diversity_-a-1_1630052586223.jpg"]], "author": ["Jan Moir for the Daily Mail"], "date": "2021-08-27"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9886541/The-Glorious-Twelfth-kicks-tweed-clad-parties-descend-moors-pursuit-red-grouse.html": {"title": "The Glorious Twelfth kicks off in style as tweed-clad parties descend on the moors in pursuit of red grouse - but some estates delay starting after birds were killed off by bad weather", "subtitle": "Guns sounded across the peatlands of Scotland and northern England as the first shots were taken Thursday.

It claims grouse moors have left Scottish hills 'ugly, barren and virtually devoid of life'.\\nThe practice also faces questions about its impact on the environment, with the Scottish Government due to bring in a licensing system to control grouse shooting.\\nMinisters have cited ongoing problems with illegal raptor persecution on or around grouse moors, as well as concerns about muirburn - burning heather moorland to provide fresh growth for game and livestock.\\nScotland's Environment Minister Mairi McAllan said: 'Grouse moor management is a complex issue, attracting strong views and public interest.\\n'The majority of those tasked with managing land already follow best practice guidance and care deeply about the countryside and the land that they manage.\\n'However, I cannot ignore the fact that some of the practices associated with grouse moor management, such as muirburn and the use of medicated grit, have the potential to cause serious harm to the environment, if the correct procedures are not followed.\\n'Neither can I ignore the fact that, despite our many attempts to address this issue, every year birds of prey continue to be killed or disappear in suspicious circumstances on or around grouse moors.\\n'This legislation is not designed to bring an end to grouse shooting. Indeed those businesses which comply with the law should have no problems at all with licensing.\\n'But, crucially, where there is clear evidence that this is not happening, where agreed standards are not being adhered to or there is evidence of illegal raptor persecution, there will be a range of effective and transparent mechanisms in place to allow us to address such behaviour.'\\nThe Glorious Twelfth marks the opening day of the red grouse shooting season, which can be found in the heather uplands of England and Scotland.\\nIt considerably boots the rural economy and provides moorland management.\\nThe Red Grouse, unique to the British Isles, has been described as the finest gamebird in the world.\\nIt is known to be a challenging gamebird to shoot due to it being an\u00a0extremely fast, low flying bird, who keeps to the contours of the moor.\\nThe grouse shooting industry is worth an estimated \u00a367 million, and creates hundreds of jobs, aiding the British economy.\\nEngland's moorland owners have dedicated more than \u00a350million annual spend on the conservation of threatened species, with the money gained from grouse shooting contributing to aiding in this.\\nThe game management controls any overpopulation of the grouse which may occur.\\nSpecies such as the golden plover and the lapwing have benefited from this management.\\nThe shoot helps to provide game meat to be sold by retailers, which is becoming increasingly popular in the UK, and has also led to British Association for Shooting Conversation releasing limited edition crisps, flavoured with grouse and pheasant.\\nSource: Fur, Feather and Fin\\nIn November, Scottish rural affairs minister Mairi Gougeon announced the Scottish Government's intention to bring in the licensing system for grouse shooting.\\nGrouse shooting remains extremely popular in certain circles, with Conservative MPs generally in favour of the sport.\\nMr Paterson, MP for North Shropshire, pointed out the\u00a0a 'spectacular conservation success' of Britain's moorlands and said people only want to destroy it because they were 'jealous'.\\nThe politician noted how the birds and biodiversity is excelling on the estates compared to the 'disfigured' landscape on other uplands.\\nIn May, he wrote in the foreword to Moorland Matters by Ian Coghill:\u00a0'Where there are no grouse moors, the hills of northern England and southern Scotland have vanished beneath silent monocultures of alien Sitka spruce trees, grown at a taxpayer-subsidised loss, or turned to low-diversity acid grassland by overgrazing with subsidised sheep, or disfigured by vast steel towers to support huge wind turbines that kill rare birds with their fast turning tips.'\\nAs Environment Secretary, Mr Paterson said he was 'acutely aware' the conservation discourse was 'owned' by wealthy pressure groups who 'often frankly instructed' officials on rural matters.\\nHe added:\u00a0'I tried to challenge this alliance between activists and civil servants and to bring science, scepticism and not a little economic reality to their thinking. It was uphill work.'\\nMeanwhile a study by Northampton University\u00a0this week found grouse shooting had positive\u00a0'ecological, economic, and social' effects that could not be replaced on the British uplands.\\nChair of the Moorland Association Mark Cunliffe-Lister told MailOnline: 'The research published this week shows that moorland management is important and there are many benefits aside from the revenue generated by shooting.\\n'We are wholly committed to playing our part in tackling climate change and improving biodiversity and that goes from strength to strength. All of our conservation work \u2013 with one milllion pounds a week spent \u2013 is underpinned by shooting a sustainable harvest of grouse.'\\nA Defra spokesman told the Telegraph: 'While the government has no current plans to carry out a review of the management of grouse moors, we recognise that it is vital that wildlife and habitats are respected and protected, and that the law is observed.\\n'We will continue to work to ensure a sustainable, mutually beneficial relationship between shooting and conservation.'\\nElsewhere in the rural sector, one of Britain's most endangered birds of prey is continuing to make a stunning comeback with figures showing a record number of births for hen harrier chicks.\\nA survey by the Moorland Association, found 77 hen harriers have been born this year, following on from a last year's record of 60.\\nAs recently as 2017, an RSPB investigation found not a single hen harrier chick was produced on England's grouse moors.\\nHen harrier breeding and the number of fledged chicks has shown remarkable progress since the introduction of the government-led hen harrier recovery to combat their dwindling numbers and a brood management trial, which involves removing some chicks from nests to rear them in captivity if multiple nests are made on grouse moors.\\nEver since the introduction of grouse shooting in the Victorian era, birds of prey such as the hen harrier have been under threat.\\nHen harriers nest and roost in heather and on open, upland moors, in close proximity to each other.\u00a0They often feed on the eggs of grouse, which also dominate the area and provide a lucrative driven grouse shooting season.\\nThis has led to hen harriers being killed in huge numbers, causing their numbers to drop.\\nAmanda Anderson, Director of the Moorland Association, which represents England's Grouse moor owners, said: 'This is another excellent year for hen harrier breeding and the wonderful pictures and footage we are seeing from our members' moors is truly heartening.\\n'Three good years in a row shows that we have the right strategy to help the population to recover to a sustainable level, occupying a much greater area of England.\\n'The management carried out on grouse moors by gamekeepers provides an ideal habitat for birds of prey, with fewer predators to steal their eggs, and good numbers of prey species such as small mammals and other birds.'\\nShe added: 'We will continue to support initiatives that are delivering results for the UK's hen harrier population.'", "image": [["Jack Trufhitt, two, joined his father Graham, 35, in Masham, North Yorkshire, for a shooting party on the moors this morning", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/12/09/46590703-9886541-image-a-5_1628757989756.jpg"], ["A shooting party on the moors in North Yorkshire is pictured as the Glorious Twelfth, the official start of the grouse shooting season, gets underway", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/12/11/46594269-9886541-image-a-15_1628764638314.jpg"], ["Guns sounded across the peatlands of Scotland (pictured, Byrecleugh Farm, Longformacus, Duns) and northern England as the first shots were taken in another season of the traditional country sport", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/12/12/46595473-9886541-image-a-27_1628767002775.jpg"], ["Shooters clad in tweed, breeks and stockings popped out of dens to take a crack at the birds after they were driven towards them by a thin line of beaters.

She's let everything grow so high, that you can't see through it. It is an absolute eyesore.\\n'I only ever hear her outside or sometimes get a glimpse of her doing her yoga in her conservatory.\\n'When her fence fell she said she couldn't afford to put it back up so I built a new one myself. I have got a Staffy and could not risk it getting out because of her lack of fence.\\n'If you look over the fence, you can see her old fence stacked up like a pile of rubbish. She has also got a wood burner. l wish she'd chop it all up and use it.'\\nOr Jacqi Smith, who helps run a local community centre and food bank in the town. She said: 'The people here do not have the capacity for Extinction Rebellion.'\\nThe retired relationship counsellor added: 'This neighbourhood has been affected particularly badly by the pandemic and we have a lot of other things to deal with in terms of money and jobs.\\n'I know Gail and I see her around. But I don't agree that stopping traffic is a way of saving the planet.'\\nAnother local, a services veteran who asked not to be named, told us: 'She is an absolute hypocrite for telling us all how to live and then driving around in that diesel car. She's even got her green credentials on it.'\\nHe went on: 'I help out at the community centre and I painted the bus stop and railings near her house. 'She came up to me and said 'Why bother?'\\n'I wasn't impressed with her attitude and had to stop myself from telling her it was none of her f***ing business. Then she wanted to know what type of paint I was using and I was happy to tell her that it was Hammerite.\\n'I have seen her moaning about people parking outside her home and right now she's parked partially on a place which clearly says 'disabled'.'\\nAnd it did seem today that her car, which she left behind all week to travel by public transport to the capital to mastermind the mayhem, has been parked outside her home, with two wheels positioned across a bay clearly marked 'disabled'.\\nYet while this may have further provoked people living nearby it seems on this score she is blameless as the bay is, Dr Bradbrook insists, no longer active.\\nHer car itself has provoked scrutiny for other reasons though.\\nThe red 2013 Citroen 4x4 1560cc is hardly what one would expect of a prominent environmentalist. The vehicle emits a serious 112g per km in Co2 emissions.\\nWere she to have driven it to this week's demo in London it would have fallen foul of Mayor Sadiq Khan's ultra low emission zone as not green enough and been subject to a \u00a312.50 daily charge.\\nDespite the apparent contraction it is decorated with stickers proclaiming: 'I am a signed up Earth Protector...stop Ecocide, change the law.'\\nIt appears she regularly drives the car the mile or so into Stroud town centre where she meets to plan the XR mayhem with fellow activists while sipping organic coffee at the Woodruffs Cafe from beans roasted in Ross-on-Wye by community groups.\\nA window next to the cafe also urges locals to practice yoga and 'dancing with the trees' in Stroud's woodland.\\nOne might expect she would prefer to walk (30 minutes) or cycle (ten minutes) for such short journeys but her fondness for using the smog-emitting Citroen is evident from the number of pay-and-display receipts from Stroud District Council placed on the dashboard.\\nDr Bradbrook, who says she favours electric-powered vehicles and public transport, has previously been challenged about using such an environmentally unfriendly vehicle but makes no apology insisting 'it claimed to be a really green car at the time when I bought it.'\\nShe has previously said that she cannot afford to replace it with a more environmentally friendly electric car.\\nDr Bradbrook, who has a PhD in molecular biophysics, complains she needs it to ferry her two children to football and rugby because of a lack of public transport in her neighbourhood of Paganhill.\\n'I can't get my kids to sports fixtures, they are both into football and rugby. I do lots of lift sharing but I can't get them there because we don't have buses running through on a Sunday,' she told Talk Radio.\\nBut her home, where she lives alone, is less than 50 metres from a bus stop and local operators Stagecoach West runs its regular number 63 bus service seven days a week.\\nAnd the town's railway station has services to Gloucester and Swindon which can then connect to other destinations like Cheltenham and London Paddington.\\nStroud is dubbed 'Hippy Central' by some because of its large number of green businesses and New Age campaigners like the XR chief. But many residents, particularly older ones, have more conservative values and frown on these newer arrivals.\\nAnd Dr Bradbrook didn't endear herself to such locals when she took a hammer to smash up a window of a branch of Barclays Bank in the town - where many volunteers have worked hard to smarten up the centre and didn't like seeing it vandalised.\\nThe attack stunt was proudly recorded on video and posted on the XR website with the headline 'Extinction Rebellion co-founder Dr Gail Bradbrook breaks window at Barclays Bank in act of civil disobedience.'\\nAfter her arrest she was charged with criminal damage, which she denies. She appeared before Cheltenham magistrates and has been bailed to be tried by a jury in November.\\nThe group claim that Barclays invest in fossil fuels and biodiversity and the losses amount to billions, and that their actions are helping to drive the climate and ecological emergency.\\nDr Bradbrook, an academic with a PHD in molecular physics, founded the environmental group after an unlikely inspiration: it took an environmentally unfriendly 11,000 mile round trip to make her realise she needed to dedicate her lift to reducing emissions from the likes of the aviation industry.\\nThat trip came in 2016 when she stayed at the \u00a32,500 luxury New Life Iboga resort in Costa Rica where she sampled local psychedelic drugs 'ayahuasca, iboga and kambo, in search of some clarity in her work.'\\nShe posted on Facebook that her holiday was 'filled with nature and the warm sea' and sightings of exotic wildlife including iguanas and monkeys that 'smash mangoes on the roofs'. And she later credited having taken the psychedelic drugs for 're-wiring' her brain and giving her the codes for 'social change.'\\nBut Dr Bradbrook's Central American trip had a carbon footprint of 2.6 tonnes \u2013 a quarter of the amount that the average Briton emits in a whole year.\\nOn returning from Costa Rica, she met Roger Hallam and they jointly set up Extinction Rebellion to save the earth from contamination.\\nThe Yorkshire-born campaigner has lived in Stroud since 2006, having first set up home in a Grade II-listed cottage with her husband a former RAF fighter pilot John Fisher.\\nDr Bradbrook has been married twice and has two sons. She had a relationship with another XR founder Simon Bramwell who also lives in the Cotswolds.\\nBut the marriage ended when the committed climate change warrior left the \u00a3400,000 home after returning from the Costa Rica trip.\\nMr Fisher still lives in the cottage overlooking playing fields on the edge of the town and the couple share custody of their two young boys.\\nBut Dr Bradbook moved to her current home, a modern three-bedroom house thought to be worth around \u00a3200,000- and soon let the gardens run wild.\\nThe front garden has 10 foot high wild blackberry bushes and buddleia which are known to attract butterflies but are often associated with derelict land. The rear garden is similarly overgrown.\\nScotland Yard said arrests have been made after demonstrators released red dye into the Buckingham Palace fountains in protest at animal hunting.\\nCampaign group Animal Rebellion staged the protest at the Victoria Memorial water feature, which sits directly in front of the Queen's London residence, on Thursday.\\nThe group said it had dyed the fountains 'blood red in a protest against use of crown land for hunting and animal agriculture' during two weeks of events in the capital urging action on the climate crisis.\\nThe Metropolitan Police tweeted: 'A number of activists have vandalised the Victoria Memorial water feature outside Buckingham Palace.\\n'We are on scene and arrests have been made. The suspects are being taken to custody.'\\nDemonstrators were detained by police officers as they stood in the red water at the monument to Queen Victoria, with some holding flares and signs.\\nHarley McDonald-Eckersall, a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion, said: 'Crown land should be used to grow healthy, nutritious food for all and to provide homes for the animals we share this country with.\\n'We are demanding that the Queen end the use of crown land for industries which are contributing to the climate and ecological emergency and the death of animals.'\\nExtinction Rebellion began its Impossible Rebellion protests on Monday and is demanding the Government immediately ends investment in fossil fuels that are driving climate change.\\nA series of arrests have been made as the environmental group targeted areas across London, including Oxford Circus on Wednesday, bringing traffic to a standstill.\\nScotland Yard said a 'significant' operation would be in place for the climate protests over the bank holiday weekend but also acknowledged the activists' 'important cause'.\\n\\n\\nBut apart from two small posters in the windows, the modest house otherwise offers few clues that its occupant is one of Britain's most militant environmentalists.\\nIt has a satellite TV dish protruding at the back and a side wall separating the house from a corner green is giving way with bricks loosening and gaps appearing.\\nAsked about apparent contradictions between her lifestyle and her campaign, Dr Bradbrook told Mail Online: 'I am not willing to continually waste energy answering questions scrutinising every decision I make in my life. It is a distraction from the real issues.\\n'For the record, I have a diesel car because it was promoted by the manufacturer as being 'eco' at the time of purchase, and it isn't possible to honour my commitments with the limited local public transport.'\\nShe declined to comment on local bus services which run past her front door and past her parked car.\\nBut told of criticism from neighbours about her overgrown and poorly maintained gardens, she said it was a deliberate design.\\n'My re-wilded garden is home to birds, bees and butterflies and visited by hedgehogs. I'm glad to have this little haven to support nature. The UK is one of the most nature depleted countries in Europe.'\\nShe said she was not breaking any laws by parking her vehicle on a designated disabled bay and had received permission from the local authority.\\nShe said: 'The lady who owned the house before me was disabled and she is no longer alive. I contacted Gloucestershire County Council and asked what to do about her disabled parking spot. They came and covered over the road marking but it has worn away.'\\nShe defended XR's fortnight of disruption in the capital which has included animal rights protesters targeting a fountain at Buckingham Palace with red paint and claiming the Queen 'has blood on her hands'\\nShe added: 'The life support systems of the earth are currently breaking down and the trajectory we are on is said by scientists to be towards the collapse of our civilization and half the world dying.\\n'We have no choice. Change will come, either through a managed transition where people have a say or through the collapse of civilization.\\n'What is needed is wholesale societal change, the kind of changes that happen when a country faces an existential threat, as we did in the second world war.\\n'Only this threat is orders of magnitude greater than even that posed by Hitler. Eighty-five per cent of the British public believe climate change concerns us all.\\n'We cannot afford at this time of our darkest hour, to be divided along the lines of who is a better Green than who.\\n'It is irresponsible to give the impression that you are only allowed to care for the environment if you live perfectly within a deeply flawed system that forces all of us to make compromises.\\n'We are all contributing to the crisis and can all be part of the solution, but for sure we can't solve it by individual actions alone.\\n'Only Governments working with business and people can make the scale of changes needed - but currently there is no credible plan.\\n'Extinction Rebellion does not tell ordinary people what to do, we challenge governments to work through Citizens Assemblies to come up with solutions together.'", "image": [["Extinction Rebellion co-founder Dr Gail Bradbrook addresses her fellow activists in Trafalgar Square in London on Monday",

A small crowd was continuing to remain under the giant table, which was put up near Leicester Square tube station.\u00a0\u00a0Officers have said that they will be confiscating the table when the protesters are finally cleared.\\nThe group blindsided officers by converging on Trafalgar Square this morning to begin two weeks of what they described as 'impossible rebellion'.\\nThe group further outsmarted officers by driving vans on two streets surrounding the Long Acre junction, before activists locked chained themselves together while lying under the vehicles' wheels.\\nThe Met had previously promised to take a harsher approach after previous Extinction Rebellion demonstrations paralysed the capital.\\nOfficers tried to bring today's protest to an end by putting in place a cordon which allowed people to leave the area but not to return to it.\\nHowever, this resulted in the area being occupied almost entirely by protesters, forcing the police to move some of their cordons.\\nShop owners, restaurateurs and accountants have been among those to slam the selfish actions of XR activists today as they shared their fury at facing further obstacles on the road to recovery after an already challenging 18-month period.\\nMustafa Ahmadi, 37, who runs Star Gifts near to Leicester Square tube station, fears he could lose as much as \u00a310,000 by the end of the week because of the climate change demo.\\nHis gift shop is close to where thousands of XR protesters have set up a giant pink table and occupied a busy road junction in between Leicester Square and Covent Garden.\\nMr Ahmadi described the protest as 'another kick in the teeth' for local businesses and warned the financial impact could be akin to another lockdown.\\nHe said:\u00a0'It's like another lockdown because the shop is so quiet. It's not just me but other businesses around here.\\n'The police have many of the roads locked off and so the tourists and families who we would normally see are being kept out.\\n'It's another kick in the teeth. I could lose \u00a310,000 if this carries on to the end of the week.\\nThousands swarmed onto a busy road junction between Leicester Square and Covent Garden, which has now become the focal point for the XR's two-week long climate change protest.\\nCommenting on the table stunt, a spokesperson said that four activists 'emerged from the truck that carried the huge object into the square and climbed onto the table'.\\nThe group say they are now 'preparing to stay for the long haul and occupy the square'.\\nThe spokesperson added: 'The table launched XR's Impossible Rebellion, bringing the seemingly impossible to life in outlandish Extinction Rebellion style.\\nThe founder of radical climate activist group Extinction Rebellion has admitted that she drives a diesel car.\\nDr Gail Bradbrook, 49, who helped to set up the protest group in 2018, made the revelation in an angry interview with TalkRadio presenter Cristo Foufas on Monday.\\nAfter revealing that she drives a car, she admitted that she does not own an electric vehicle because she cannot afford one.\\nWhen pressed further by Foufas about what type of car it was, she admitted it is powered by diesel, which is considered by experts to be even more harmful to the environment than petrol.\\nShe said that she needs the car to take her children to football and rugby fixtures because her home is not served by 'buses that run on a Sunday.'\\n'The table \u2013 packed with a number of built in lock ons, sleeping quarters and its own stereo system \u2013 was followed by thousands of marchers from Trafalgar Square who arrived to demand the impossible, many of whom were equipped with pink chairs.\\n'As floods, fire and famine break out around the world, it is clear that climate breakdown is here now, and there is no choice left now but to take urgent action.\\n'Everyone deserves a seat at the table to have a say in how to tackle the greatest crisis of our times.'\\nMr Ahmadi, whose business was shut throughout the lockdown at the start of the year, said: 'I'm trying to cover what I lost during the Pandemic and this is not helping.\\nHe told MailOnline: 'They gave us no warning. Many protests come past the shop but we are always given notification. Not today, the protesters turned up just after midday and closed the area down.\\n'I've no idea how long they plan to stick around. I hope they make their point quickly and then go. Otherwise I want the police to do their job and move them on.\\n'We've only just re-opened after lockdown and the footfall is already down significantly since the protest began.'\\nRoberta Marzocca, general manger of the Pizza Pilgrims restaurant, said: 'We were closed down completely between December and May because of lockdown, the last thing we need is to be hit financially again.\\n'The police have some of the roads cordoned off but we hope customers will still come.\\n'It's still too early to tell if we'll be negatively affected - I really hope not.'\\nAt around 6pm on Monday evening, the Met announced on Twitter that the protest on the junction of Long Acre\u00a0Long Acre, St Martins Lane and Garrick Street had to end by 7pm.\\nWhen that was ignored, they began moving in to make mass arrests.\\nFour protesters who had chained themselves themselves together under the front wheel arches of an open top van, which had been parked nearby on Garrick Street, finally began to be removed by officers.\\nAnother two protesters had earlier climbed on top of the van waving XR flags as police watched on.\\nAt around 6pm, officers moved in and arrested four protesters who had fixed themselves to another van parked on St Martins Lane, near the Noel Coward Theatre.\\nPolice officers, specially trained to work at heights and to separate people who chain or lock themselves together, were brought in from neighbouring Thames Valley Police but also from as far afield as Merseyside.\\nPolice have pledged to take a more robust approach to Extinction Rebellion protesters to stop them from paralysing London as they did two years ago.\\nActivists form the climate change awareness group have set up a giant pink table in the middle of the West End and a crowd of thousands has gathered around it, bringing a bustling part of the city between Leicester Square and Covent Garden to a standstill.\\nBut a senior officer at the scene told MailOnline today that the protesters would not be allowed to occupy the area for days on end like they did during the last summer protests in 2019.\\nThere were no demonstrations last year due to the Coronavirus pandemic but two years ago, XR protesters brought in a pink boat and put it in the middle of Oxford Circus where they remained for a fortnight.\\nThe officer said: 'You saw the chaos Extinction Rebellion caused during their summer protest in 2019 and how the Met was criticised for not doing enough to stop it.\\n'That won't be allowed to happen again.\\n'The protesters who have set up the pink table want to remain in the area for a considerable amount of time, potentially days, but we have teams ready to move them on.\\n'Some protesters have chained themselves under a vehicle but we have teams ready to react to that too.\\n'They took us by surprise today, we didn't know they were planning on pitching up here until they put the giant table structure up. Precautions had been put in place in other parts of London but this was unexpected.\\n'We now hope they move on, we are not anticipating violence as this is civil disobedience rather than anything more sinister.\\n'It's also just the start of two weeks worth of protests and nobody wants to get arrested so early on.\\n'But when the time comes - most likely later today - the protesters will be cleared from the area because we also have a duty to those business owners whose trade may be affected negatively due to this protest.'\\nOne of the protesters who had chained herself to the van said she was called 'Rosie' and had travelled to London from the Midlands.\\nShe locked herself in place just after midday and did not know any of the other protesters doing the same.\\nShe said: 'I am doing this in solidarity with all those who have lost lives, lost homes and lost livelihoods due to the effects of climate change.\\n'This is for those who had suffered from the horrendous floods and wildfires, for those people on small island nations which are at risk of being lost to the sea.\\n'The rational response is to do something about this - to do what we can. I've no idea if this is going to work but I have to try and do something. It's no good just burying my head.\\n'My mood is one of determination, I want to stay here under the van for as long as possible, for as long as it takes.'\\nThe crowd had earlier meandered through the West End, past theatres, from Trafalgar Square where the protest had begun just after 10am.\\nSamba bands banged drums and blew whistles and protesters chanted slogans under the watchful gaze of hundreds of police officers, who are attempting to stop London from being paralysed as in previous years.\\nHowever, frustrated motorists in vans and lorries brought to a standstill vented their anger at being caught up in the traffic nightmare.\\nOne refrigerator repairman fumed: 'It's hard enough getting through London at the best of times let alone when people are blocking the road.\\n'I get that they are protesting but I'm trying to get to work and so are many other people. It's not on'\\nGail Bradbrook, co-founder of the activist group, opened the 'Impossible Rebellion' with a speech expressing solidarity with nations that are disproportionately affected by climate change.\\nCampaigners held placards with messages including 'Code red, where's the action' while four people were dressed as the sea in a warning over rising sea levels.\\nThe demonstration signals the start of a fortnight's action by Extinction Rebellion (XR), who are staging various protests across the capital.\\nA small group of activists started early yesterday, with three of them scaling the Guildhall in the City and daubing red paint onto the building and unfurling a banner proclaiming 'co-liberation freedom together' in front of a crowd of supporters. Nine people were later arrested.\\nBoth the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police were on high alert for similar stunts today with officers patrolling outside high-risk buildings like St Paul's Cathedral and the London Stock Exchange.\\nXR organisers had asked supporters to gather at Trafalgar Square for 10am this morning.\\nA large group - made up of three separate Samba bands - had met in St James' Park, just behind Downing Street, an hour beforehand under the watchful gaze of the police.\\nThey were given an escort to Trafalgar Square, holding up traffic for ten minutes and prompting irritated motorists to honk their car horns in frustration.\\nTwo Metropolitan Police helicopters hovered overhead monitoring the crowd below.\\nAfter an hour in the square - where some of the 1,000 gathered listened to speeches on climate change -they began to march once more and again block the road.\\nSome had banners which read 'Code Red for Humanity' and 'Rebel for Life' while many others waved colourful flags bearing the XR hourglass symbol.\\nXR activist Jenn Parkhouse, 55, was part of a group who had travelled into London from Norwich.\\nShe told MailOnline: 'We now run out of time, there must be no more dilly dallying around.\\n'The Government must now stop all fossil fuel investment - and that goes to the banks, particularly U.S banks who are massive offenders and have invested trillions of dollars into fossil fuels despite signing up to the 2015 Paris agreement.\\n'The time for talking is over, we are on the precipice now.\u00a0How can our Government continue to ignore report after reports that carbon emissions have reached pandemic proportions?\\n'We need to act to halt this climate catastrophe, and we have take a similar approach to how we have coped with the COVID pandemic. This is a climate and eco crisis and we are in grave danger.'\\nOliver Baines, 70, was one of 100 activists who had made the gruelling six-hour journey into London from Cornwall.\\nHe said: 'We have to end the extraction of fossil fuels, it's a simple, clear message and we just do not have any more time to waste\\n'There have been too many words, now is the time for action.\u00a0We have activists here from all over the country.\u00a0There will be actions in the city, that's for sure.\\n'The Guildhall was targeted because it's a symbol of the City. The City has profited from slave trade, arms investment and of course from investing in fossil fuels and it now needs to step up and do the right thing and stop that investment now.'\\nRed paint can still be seen above the entrance to the Guildhall, although the area was quiet this morning.\\nPolice scuffled with protesters outside the building yesterday at about 8pm and brought in a ladder to remove protesters who had climbed onto an alcove above the main entrance.\\nOf the nine arrests, three were on suspicion of criminal damage and a further five were arrested for conspiracy to cause criminal damage.\\nA further person was arrested for going equipped to cause criminal damage, The Met said.\\nThe movement has gained support from celebrities such as comedian and author Stephen Fry and actor Jerome Flynn.\\nIn a video shared on Twitter, Fry praised the group for attempting to 'make politicians really recalibrate, realign, revolutionise politics' through their 'mucky' and 'disruptive' demonstrations.\\nFlynn attended a protest on Sunday evening in which three activists scaled the entrance of the Guildhall building in central London.\\nA crowd of about 200 people gathered as the trio sprayed red spray paint over the walls of the building and unfurled a banner reading 'co-liberation freedom together'.\\nThe Game Of Thrones actor told the PA news agency it was 'more urgent than ever' for people to take a stand together.\\n'We've gotten used to certain systems that are life destructive, we created them, we've become addicted to them and we know the world is burning as a result,' he said.\\nExtinction Rebellion vowed to return to the streets earlier this month following a string of victories in court which saw activists successfully appeal convictions for previous stunts.\\nTheir latest protest comes after a major science review by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirmed that human activity such as burning fossil fuels was unequivocally driving the climate crisis, with impacts such as deadly heatwaves, floods and storms already being felt.\\nIn November the UK will host the international Cop26 summit where the pressure will be on world leaders to increase action to urgently cut greenhouse gases and avoid even more dangerous global warming.", "image": [["Police finally began making mass arrests on Monday evening after London's West End was paralysed for hours by Extinction Rebellion protesters who had erected a giant pink table in the middle of the road", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/23/21/47014129-9918587-image-a-31_1629750015668.jpg"], ["Officers moved in after demonstrators ignored repeated demands - made by loudspeaker - for them to leave the area", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/23/21/47014111-9918587-image-a-34_1629750031775.jpg"], ["Until they began making mass arrests at 8pm, the Metropolitan police had detained just eight people, despite the fact that the protest began at midday today.

By the 1980s most large economies had reduced or even ended its use in petrol. A UN campaign began in 2002 to push smaller economies to also end its use. Algeria became the final country to stop its widespread vehicle use in 2021.", "text": "The world has finally said 'goodbye' to leaded petrol, after Algeria became the final country to end its reliance on the highly toxic fuel source.\\nAs recently as the year 2000 over 100 countries worldwide still used leaded petrol, despite evidence linking it to premature deaths, poor health and air pollution.\\nThe first warnings about its dangers were issued in 1924, and now, nearly a century later, Algeria has become the last country to exhaust its supplies and stop its use.\\nThe United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) described the news a landmark win in the fight for cleaner air, adding the leaded petrol ban prevented 1.2 million premature deaths and saved the economy\u00a0over $2.4 trillion every year.\\nTetraethyllead is an organolead compound added to petrol for nearly 100 years to 'boost performance'.\\nIt is often abbreviated to TEL and was first mixed with gasoline beginning in the 1920s by General Motors.\\nThey realised it was both effective and cost effective at improving vehicle performance so began its rollout.\\nIt worked at improving both performance and fuel economy and was in wide use until the 1990s.\\nWithin just a few years, by 1924, it became clear there were serious health and pollutant implications.\\nThese problems appeared to have a serious toxic impact on children.\\nIt wasn't just damaging people and the environment, studies found lead was poisoned catalytic converters and was a major cause of spark plug fouling.\\nCountries began to phase out its use in the 1970s, with most of the larger economies banning it before 2000.\\nA UN study in 2010 found that the ban on TEL had resulted in $2.4 trillion in annual benefits, and 1.2 million fewer premature deaths.\\nTEL is still used as an additive in some grades of aviation fuel, particularly for smaller planes.\\nAlgeria became the last country to use the fuel in vehicles in August 2021.\\nThe economic benefit comes from a\u00a02010 study led by scientists at California State University that\u00a0linked the value to better health, lower medical costs and a dip in criminal activity, as crime rates spike when exposure to lead increases.\\nPetroleum containing tetraethyllead, a form of lead, was first sold almost 100 years ago to increase engine performance.\\nIt was widely used for decades until researchers discovered that it could cause heart disease, strokes and brain damage.\\nUNEP cited studies suggesting that leaded gas caused measurable intellectual impairment in children and millions of premature deaths.\\nUNEP launched a campaign in 2002 for a global ban on the use of leaded petrol, and by that point many major economies had already stopped its use.\\nThis included the US, China, India and the UK, which banned it from being sold at petrol stations or used in vehicles in 1999.\\nDespite significant evidence of its dangers, the situation in lower-income nations remained dire, according to UNEP and took more than a decade to rectify.\\nBy 2016, after North Korea, Myanmar and Afghanistan stopped selling leaded petrol, only a handful of countries were still operating service stations providing the fuel.\\nAlgeria was the final holdout in allowing use of the pollutant, after Iraq and Yemen ended their use within the last few years.\\n'The successful enforcement of the ban on leaded petrol is a huge milestone for global health and our environment,' said Inger Andersen, executive director of UNEP, which is headquartered in Nairobi.\\nConcerns were first raised about leaded petrol as early as 1924, when dozens of workers were hospitalised and five dead after suffering convulsions at a refinery run by US giant Standard Oil, nicknamed the 'looney gas building' by staff.\\nNevertheless, until the 1970s almost all the gasoline sold across the globe contained lead. Taking another two decades before governments began to take action.\\nUNEP said in a statement that the eradication of leaded petrol would 'prevent more than 1.2 million premature deaths per year, increase IQ points among children, save $2.44 trillion for the global economy, and decrease crime rates.'\\nThe agency said the dollar figure came from a 2010 study led by scientists at California State University at Northridge.\\nE10 petrol contains up to 10 per cent renewable ethanol, which the government says will help to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.\\nPetrol in the UK currently contains up to 5 per cent renewable ethanol - E5.\\nE10 petrol is already widely used around the world, including across Europe, the US and Australia.\\nIt is also been the reference fuel against which new cars are tested for emissions and performance.\\nAlmost all petrol-powered vehicles on the road today can use E10 petrol and all cars built since 2011 are compatible.\\nThe following vehicles, however, may not be compatible with E10 petrol:\\nIts chief factors were the benefits of better health for the overall economy and lower medical costs.\\nThe study, funded by the UN, also found the ban led to a dip in criminal activity - higher crime rates have previously been linked to exposure to leaded fuel.\\nUNEP warned that fossil fuel use in general must still be drastically reduced to stave off the frightening effects of climate change.\\nA recent UN report found that the Earth is likely to warm by 2.7F within the next 20 years \u2014 a decade earlier than previously expected.\\nIt also found that heatwaves, flooding and droughts will become more frequent and intense. Confirming these were directly linked to human-linked actions.\\nThe report was compiled by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and said drastic action was needed to prevent worse outcomes.\\nThe report sent alarm bells ringing about the use of fossil fuels, with the topic expected to be a key point of discussion at the\u00a02021 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in November.\\nGreenpeace hailed the news of the end of leaded petrol around the world as 'a celebration of the end of one toxic era.'\\n'It shows that if we can phase out one of the most dangerous polluting fuels in the 20th century, we can absolutely phase out all fossil fuels,' said Thandile Chinyavanhu, climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace Africa.\\n'Africa's governments must give no more excuses for the fossil fuel industry,' she added.\\nGlobally, vehicle sales are set to climb exponentially, particularly in emerging markets, with UNEP finding the transport sector responsible for nearly a quarter of energy-related global greenhouse gas emissions.\\nThey found this was expected to grow by a third by 2050, with 1.2 billion new vehicles expected to hit the streets.\\n'This includes millions of poor-quality used vehicles exported from Europe, the United States and Japan, to mid- and low-income countries,' UNEP warned.\\n'This contributes to planet warming and air polluting traffic and (is) bound to cause accidents,' the global body said.\\nAccording to the Environmental protection Agency, there are six major pollutants which can impact on human health and well-being.\\nParticulate matter:\u00a0Particulate matter is the term for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air.\\nThese particles come in many sizes and shapes and can be made up of hundreds of different chemicals.\\nSome are emitted directly from a source, such as construction sites, unpaved roads, fields, smokestacks or fires.\\nFine particles (2.5 parts per million)are the main cause of reduced visibility (haze) in parts of the United States, including many of our treasured national parks and wilderness areas.\\n\\nCarbon monoxide:\u00a0Breathing air with a high concentration of CO reduces the amount of oxygen that can be transported in the blood stream to critical organs like the heart and brain.\\nAt very high levels, which are possible indoors or in other enclosed environments, CO can cause dizziness, confusion, unconsciousness and death.\\n\\nNitrogen dioxide: Nitrogen dioxide primarily gets in the air from the burning of fuel. NO\\nIt forms from emissions from cars, trucks and buses, power plants, and off-road equipment.\\nBreathing air with a high concentration of NO can irritate airways in the human respiratory system. Such exposures over short periods can aggravate respiratory diseases, particularly asthma, leading to respiratory symptoms (such as coughing, wheezing or difficulty breathing).\\nSulfur dioxide:\u00a0The largest source of Sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels by power plants and other industrial facilities.\\nShort-term exposures to SO can harm the human respiratory system and make breathing difficult. Children, the elderly, and those who suffer from asthma are particularly sensitive to effects of SO.\\n\\nGround-level Ozone: The ozone layer in the lower area of the lower portion of the stratosphere, approximately 12 to 19 miles above the surface of the planet (20 to 30 km).\\nAlthough ozone protects us against UV radiation, when it is found at ground level it can cause health problems for vulnerable people who suffer from lung diseases such as asthma.\\nIt is created by chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) - that are found in exhaust fumes - in the presence of sunlight.\\nLead: Major sources of lead in the air are ore and metals processing and piston-engine aircraft operating on leaded aviation fuel.\\nOther sources are waste incinerators, utilities, and lead-acid battery manufacturers. The highest air concentrations of lead are usually found near lead smelters.\\nDepending on the level of exposure, lead can adversely affect the nervous system, kidney function, immune system, reproductive and developmental systems and the cardiovascular system.\\nInfants and young children are especially sensitive to even low levels of lead, which may contribute to behavioural problems, learning deficits and lowered IQ.\\nSource: EPA", "image": null, "author": ["Ryan Morrison For Mailonline", "Afp"], "date": "2021-08-30"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9865845/XR-protestor-wins-appeal-against-conviction-blocking-road-London-City-Airport-protest.html": {"title": "Extinction Rebellion protestor wins appeal against conviction for blocking road in London City Airport protest in latest victory for climate campaigners following Supreme Court ruling", "subtitle": "Amelia Halls, from Stamford, had her conviction for obstructing a road quashed.

It is pretty clear they have not.\\n'The only question is the degree of their failures. The burden on them is even greater to identify and correct any errors now and to account for themselves publicly.'\\nThe London City Airport protests saw demonstrators block the roads into the site and shut down its Docklands Light Railway station.\\nOne protester also forced the Aer Lingus flight to Dublin to turn around on the runway as he stood up and roamed the cabin while giving a lecture on climate change just before take-off.\\nAngry passengers urged cabin crew to 'do us all a favour and remove him from the plane', with others telling him: 'You need to sit down.'\\nAmid the security breach, passengers arriving for flights had to show their boarding cards before entering the terminal, after XR protesters declared they would occupy and shut down the airport in East London.\\nOne activist also leapt on top of a\u00a0British Airways jet and glued himself down amid the protests, dubbed the 'October Rebellion'.\\nJames Brown, a partially-sighted Irish cyclist who was banned from athletics in 2016 for a doping violation, was able to circumvent security at London City Airport by buying a boarding pass.\\nThis allowed him to get through the relevant security checks that are prevalent at any UK airport and board a flight he had no intention of taking.\\nBrown was being helped onto the plane by staff when he broke free and apparently managing to\u00a0shin up the side of the fuselage and on to the roof.\\nHe admitted he was 's***ing myself' while filming a video in the wind from on top of the Embraer 190 plane bound for Amsterdam.\\nAt the time,\u00a0Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick slammed Brown saying it was a 'stupid and dangerous thing to do'.\\nShe said: 'My early understanding is somebody has been arrested after they presumably bought a ticket, went through security perfectly normally, went up the steps of a plane and hurled themselves on top of a plane.\\n'Actually, that was a reckless, stupid and dangerous thing to do for all concerned.

protest that saw demonstrators glue themselves to a bus that was blocking London Bridge.\\nIn video footage shared online, officers can be seen grappling with protesters before forcibly moving them from an open-top vintage bus with a wooden structure attached to the rear.\\nThe southern end of the London Bridge was taken over by XR activists, who blocked the road with a bus on Tuesday.\\nThis followed a similar demonstration on Tower Bridge and sat on top of a parked caravan on Monday as the environmental activists continue their fortnight of action.\\nThe Metropolitan Police said that as of 6.45pm on Tuesday, 43 further arrests had been made in connection with the protests, taking the total number to 469.\\nThe force said the arrests were made for a variety of offences.\\nOfficers surrounded the bus on London Bridge and were seen using batons and dragging protesters off the vehicle.\\nOther demonstrators were handcuffed and police blocked several nearby streets to stop people entering the area.\\nFootage showed scores of Met officers pushing back activists, who continued to advance, banging drums and clapping, while others glued themselves to pavements.\\nEarlier, more arrived at London Bridge station waving banners and placards, with slogans including 'stop the harm' and 'please don't arrest me, I'm on call tomorrow'.\\nPedestrians coming from the station were diverted away from the protest by approximately 20 officers and police vans on one road alone.\\nAn officer confirmed some people taking part in the protest were being arrested, and the road closures would be in place 'for hours'.\\nThe Met later defended the use of force by its officers saying the use of force was 'reasonable and proportionate'.\\nThe force tweeted: 'There have been some questions today on our use of force while attempting to disrupt the protest involving Extinction Rebellion's bus.\\n'It is very clear that the demo near London Bridge was an attempt to cause a major disruption to one of London's busiest bridges.\\n'Seeing this, officers nearby took immediate action to prevent any unreasonable disruption to the highway, and to detain those attempting to cause disruption or who were obstructing officers in the lawful execution of their duty.\\n'We believe this swift action prevented some protesters from setting up further complex lock-on devices which were inside the bus.\\n'Given the circumstances and likely disruption to the community, our initial assessment is that their use of force was reasonable and proportionate.'\\nAmong those taking part in the protest was Olympic medallist Etienne Stott, who was filmed sitting in the middle of the road speaking to police.\\nThe slalom canoer, who took gold at the 2012 London games, refused to move and was eventually picked up and carried off by officers, shouting 'this is important'.\\nExtinction Rebellion London tweeted: 'We will leave the streets when the Government starts treating the climate emergency like an emergency.\\n'Covid showed what the Government can do in a crisis, it's the level of response required for the climate but sustained over years. \u00a3ExtinctionRebellion'.\\nEleven demonstrators were arrested during the Tower Bridge protest on Monday.\\nIt comes after the eco-activists were today accused of jumping the shark - after targeting the headquarters of beloved wildlife preservation and environment cause the WWF.\\nThey hit the HQ in Woking at 9.30am under the explanation of it being\u00a0in solidarity with indigenous groups in Tanzania, Cameroon and Kenya.\\nAn XR spokesman claimed the groups were being evicted and persecuted by WWF's conservation activities.\\nBut the stunt was greeted by utter bemusement by most members of the public.\\nAnd MP Alexander Stafford said: 'They've completely\u00a0jumped the shark.\\n'By attacking those that work to protect the environment, halt our natural decline, & stop climate change, they have revealed their own nihilistic hand.\\n'Groups like WWF\u00a0have done far more and will do more for our planet than these extremists.'\\nThe phrase 'jumping the shark' refers to when someone does something far-fetched to try and maintain interest.\\nEarlier protesters, from offshoot Animal Rebellion, wanted dairy company Arla to transition to plant-based production by 2025 and claim they will not leave the firm's site in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, until it agrees to do so.\\nIt claims Arla emitted more greenhouse gases in 2017 than BHP, a mining company, and ConocoPhillips, an oil producer.\\nJames Ozden, a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion, said: 'The dairy industry abuses animals, the planet and workers, who are increasingly squeezed by big business.\\n'Arla say they're pro-worker but lobby for supermarket contracts that sell milk for less than water.\\n'We're not just demanding that Arla go plant-based by 2025, we're demanding that the Government supports companies like Arla by funding a just transition for workers in meat and dairy industries to just and sustainable alternatives.'\\nThe group said a climate crisis could lead to unstable crop supplies to feed dairy cows and also potentially expose them to heat stress for two months longer than usual, which could lead to a milk shortage.\\nAt London Bridge, Metropolitan Police officers eventually surrounded the vehicle atop the bridge and several streets\u00a0to stop people entering the area.\\nThe force tweeted: 'Officers are responding to a demonstration in #LondonBridge where protesters have assembled and are blocking the road.\\n'We are currently assessing the situation working to keep disruption in the area to a minimum.'\\nPedestrians coming from London Bridge Underground station were diverted away from the

Bridge.\\nMore than 300 arrests have been made during the first week of Extinction Rebellion's fifth wave of mass protests in London.\\nSome 11 activists were arrested during action on Bank Holiday Monday, which saw protesters block Tower Bridge with a van and caravan.\\nIt follows 34 arrests on Sunday when demonstrators occupied the Science Museum in protest against its partnership with oil giant Shell.\\nThe Metropolitan Police said there had been a total of 367 arrests in the capital since the environmentalist group began its latest round of action, dubbed the Impossible Rebellion, on August 23.\\nThe group is demanding the Government stops investment in fossil fuels.\\nAs part of the protests, activists have blocked a road in central London with a large pink table containing built-in lock-ons, spray painted the floor outside the HM Revenue & Customs headquarters and daubed the famous Guildhall in the City of London in red paint.\\nAnimal Rebellion, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, dyed the Buckingham Palace fountains red in protest at animal hunting.\\nOn Monday, activists were seen lying on the ground near Tower Bridge, while others wore aprons emblazoned with Tell The Truth and with teapots with Deniabilitea written on them.\\nProtesters were seen to be removed by officers prior to the blocking of the bridge.\\nThe Metropolitan Police said demonstrators had used 'complex' lock-ons 'to frustrate our removal efforts', and specialist removal teams were drafted in.\\nThe force said on Twitter: 'We see many comments and questions asking why

is taking us back to the Dark Ages", "subtitle": "Latest news and updates on all of your favourite Love Island contestants.", "text": "There are few topics that divide opinion more keenly in my house than Love Island. The Teenagers, each in their unique way, are obsessed. My daughter watches it with her boyfriend; they seem to love and hate it in equal measure, taking sides furiously while at the same time disparaging the show\u2019s obvious flaws.\\nOccasionally, I am drafted in to watch. On Friday night, as we observed various couples partake in a series of monosyllabic dates, culminating in Liberty (standard-issue pneumatic blonde) and Jake (equally standard-issue tattooed hunk) announcing their separation, we were transfixed by Chloe\u2019s underboob, Liberty\u2019s white lace trousers, and the almost comedic attempts of their co-islanders to register emotion through the multiple layers of make-up, Botox and fillers.\\nAfterwards, my daughter asked me if I thought she should get a boob-job.\\nShe is 18. I said \u2018no\u2019, obviously.\\nMy SON, meanwhile, takes a more straightforward, and some might say, male view. \u2018I get that you hate it, Mum,\u2019 he said, shovelling down breakfast eggs and beans yesterday morning, \u2018but I don\u2019t see what\u2019s not to like about being sent to Majorca and being paid to have as much sex as you can with a load of fit women. Then come home to five million followers on Instagram and a bunch of brands desperate to sign you up and never having to work again.\u2019\\nHe is, as you can probably tell, 16. But he has a point.\\nHis view is largely representative of his age group and, I suspect, the reason why Love Island is such a ratings-grabber. He is precisely the kind of market the show is aimed at \u2013 and the reason it boasts lucrative sponsorship and product-placement deals worth somewhere north of \u00a370 million, with brands including Tinder, Just Eat, JD Sports and various other sources of youthful gratification.\\nIt\u2019s also why I hate it so much. Hate it with a passion. Hate the vacuous messages it sends and the cynical way it manipulates the contestants. Hate the soapy sentiment and the overblown emotions. Hate the cookie-cutter version of physical desirability it promotes.\\nHate the fleshy vulgarity of it and, perhaps most of all, hate the rank hypocrisy and sheer brass neck of ITV for screening it alongside adverts for mental health charities and other empty-minded sentiment designed to gloss over the fact that four people associated with the show, including former presenter Caroline Flack, have taken their own lives. Nor am I the only one.\\nThis series (the seventh), has led to a record 33,540 complaints to the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom \u2013most (24,910, to be precise) related to the episode where Faye (heavily enhanced pneumatic blonde) stomped around the villa hurling abuse at Teddy (wholly innocuous hunk) after she was shown an out-of-context clip of him saying he fancied someone else.\\nIt is, I\u2019m afraid, just representative of everything that is depressingly soul-destroying about the modern world. The plastic surgery, the absence of morals, the something-for-nothing culture.\\nBut that\u2019s not all; it also takes us back to the Dark Ages. It\u2019s barbaric and gladiatorial in the way it presents suffering as entertainment, encouraging us to salivate and pore over glistening young bodies as we follow the fortunes \u2013 and misfortunes \u2013 of this surgically enhanced, fame-hungry group of desperados. There\u2019s something of the Colosseum about the way these muscle-bound young people are forced to demonstrate their physical and sexual prowess for the pleasure of the spectator.\\nSomething humiliating and dehumanising about the way they all have to sleep together in the same room, to perform their tricks beneath the constant eye of the cameras; about the way they are carted off once a week to have their nails and lash extensions topped up, their excess hair removed, their fake tans reapplied before being sent out, once again, into the arena. It\u2019s cruel, crass and exploitative. And it demeans us all.\\nTomorrow is the final episode. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s the last.\\nAnd the barefaced hypocrite of the week award goes to\u2026 Prince Harry, for flying 750 miles home to California from a polo match (for charidee, natch) in a chum\u2019s \u00a345 million private jet.\\nWhy on earth do we have to take a PCR test every time we visit a GP \u2013 even if we don\u2019t have Covid?\\n\u2018It\u2019s policy,\u2019 I was told recently when seeking treatment for a gammy knee.\\nInstead, I hobbled to my local chemist, where the nice Mr Shah gave me some Voltarol and a brace. Makes you wonder why we pay GPs an average of \u00a3100,000 a year.\\nThe \u00a350 million cost of policing the antics of Extinction Rebellion will rise with more protests due this week.\\nYet this country is responsible for only one per cent of global emissions (unlike China\u2019s 27 per cent) and we are doing our bit to help save the environment.\\nIf XR were not merely virtue-signalling anarchists, they would chain themselves to the door of the Chinese Embassy.\\nSadly, I\u2019m not convinced that school lessons on \u2018coercive control\u2019 and \u2018hatred of women\u2019 will help counter the growing \u2018incel\u2019 movement.\\nMisogynists such as the Plymouth gunman won\u2019t change their deeply paranoid antipathy to women because well-meaning teachers tell them to play nicely.\\nChanging for the worse\\nChannel 4\u2019s awful reboot of Changing Rooms, starring the unauthentic and self-referential presenter Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, makes the original 1990s home makeover series seem about as sedate as Mastermind.\\nDesigners surpassed themselves last week by creating an item of wall \u2018art\u2019 out of hair extensions.\\nIf Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo And Juliet now requires a trigger warning, God help today\u2019s youth if they ever stumble across a performance of Hamlet, where the murder body count is nine.\\nGeneral Motors are recalling their Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles over fears the lithium batteries might cause fires that reach temperatures of 2,000C.\\nI\u2019m not saying electric cars aren\u2019t the future \u2013 just that they may not be the Holy Grail green zealots believe.\\nTragic to hear about the death of children\u2019s author Jill Murphy. Her Worst Witch books and story about Mrs Large the elephant resonated deeply with my two when they were small.\\nJill truly understood children and parents. Her warmth, wit and wise insight will be greatly missed.\\nSome lament the casting of Dominic West as Charles in Netflix\u2019s The Crown, saying he\u2019s too dashing.\\nI\u2019m not sure, but one thing is clear: I\u2019ve never seen Charles in a suit as poorly cut as the one sported by West. And brown? In town? Have the producers taken leave of their senses?\\nTech tycoon Elon Musk says he\u2019s building a \u2018friendly robot that won\u2019t fight back\u2019, to perform menial tasks.

It really annoys me.'\\nNow, remarkably, something like that is happening \u2014 although the new apocalyptic daily lectures are being delivered not by an old-style fire-and-brimstone preacher but by its modern equivalent: the fanatical Chris Packham, who wants us all to change our wicked ways to avoid the planet being engulfed in flames through (he says) excessive use of fossil fuels.\\n\\nMeltdown\\nLast week, the Today programme launched a daily Packham mini-lecture in which the broadcaster \u2014 who wore a tie with the Extinction Rebellion logo when collecting his CBE from Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace in 2019 \u2014 tells us how to behave so as to avert Armageddon via carbon emissions. I heard the first two.\\nIn one, Packham proclaimed: 'We still have time to save the world.' (In reality, the planet has billions of years left, regardless of whether we humans, Today listeners or not, switch from diesel to electric cars.)\\nIn the other, Packham intoned that we were heading for 'climate meltdown and a sixth mass extinction', while denouncing what he called 'my adversaries' as 'vicious'.\\nOne old BBC hand has told me he felt his employer 'crossed a line' in giving Packham such a privileged platform and seeming to endorse it, adding: 'He's a contentious campaigner.\\nYou don't need to dispute the science of human-influenced climate change to find him over-the-top.'\\nNaturally, the BBC man would never dare say this publicly.\\nAnd, just as we would ask of religious zealots, the question arises: does Chris Packham practise what he preaches?\\nNot according to Lord (Ian) Botham, the stupendous ex-cricketer and fundraiser for leukaemia research.\\nTwo months ago, Botham hit Packham for six with an article pointing out that the Springwatch presenter 'promotes holidays for the rich that encourage people to go on very long flights to places like Botswana, Peru and the Falkland Islands. Flights which create eye-watering emissions'.\\nBotham continued: 'Take the holiday he is currently endorsing in Papua New Guinea for \u00a313,600 per person. For that price you can ''follow in the footsteps of Chris''. The tour company also assures us that Chris is a ''Travel Hero''.\u00a0But is he a Carbon Hero?'\\nPackham responded that he will not be going on any more such trips.\\nThe same question might be asked of Alok Sharma, whom the Prime Minister appointed 'president' of the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, known as COP26.\\nAs the Mail revealed last week, this so-called 'climate tsar' has over the past seven months jetted to at least 30 nations (never once quarantining, although many of them were on the Government's red list) and covering about 200,000 miles.\\nThe PM's spokesman defended Sharma's globetrotting: 'Travel to key countries for face-to-face talks is essential. For example, immediately following his visit to Japan and South Korea, the governments there committed to ambitious net zero targets.'\\nNo 10 really expects us to believe that such commitments emerged solely as a result of Sharma's amazing personal presence \u2014 which would come as a surprise to his underwhelmed parliamentary colleagues.\\nAnd yesterday, Sharma told The Sunday Times that online meetings would have failed, describing them as 'the doom of Zoom'.\\nSalvation\\nWait: I thought it was meant to be excessive plane flights that would bring about doom for the planet?\\nNo, that's only when it's being done by the rest of us. Truly, some of the most powerful proselytisers of 'zero carbon' are reminiscent of those Renaissance Popes who preached against lust and professed celibacy while enjoying the favours of sundry mistresses.\\nThe Christian churches, however, also had good news to offer: if you behaved well, loved your neighbour and so forth, then there was a prospect of avoiding hellfire and instead proceeding to the heavenly afterlife. There is nothing like that from those warning of a fiery apocalypse on Earth.\\nThis was pointed out brilliantly by the French philosopher Pascal Bruckner in his book, The Fanaticism Of The Apocalypse.\\nHe saw the more extreme 'Greens' as rather akin to the Jesuits who educated him: obsessed with the idea of salvation through leading a pure and simple life.\\nBut he said that at least the preachers of his youth had a passionate belief in man as well as God.\\nBy contrast, the green prophets see mankind as a blight on the planet, and the fewer of us the better: exactly the reverse of God's injunction to 'be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it'.\\nWeirdly, however, a number of figures in the Church of England have made common cause with the neo-pagans of Extinction Rebellion.\\nSo, for example, during the XR demonstrations of October 2019, the Bishop of Liverpool, Paul Bayes, led 20 vicars in reading the complete Book of Revelation \u2014 on the same platform as various XR doomsday cultists had been performing a ritual they called a 'die-in'.\\nAnd this cult has its own equivalent of an Old Testament prophet, in the teenage Swede, Greta Thunberg.\\nIn this context, she is also redolent of Sister Lucia, one of the three youthful 'visionaries of Fatima' who, in Portugal in 1917, claimed among other things that they had been shown a vision of Hell by the Virgin Mary.\\nThunberg definitely knows how to communicate her own terror at the alleged imminence of a planet in flames \u2014 and she has nothing but contempt for the likes of Alok Sharma.\\nApocalypse\\nLike her followers in XR, Thunberg regards the governments of the West as too wedded to the wickedness (as she sees it) of perpetual economic growth to take the necessary steps to 'save' the planet from apocalypse.\\nUnfortunately for her, it is the people as a whole, and not just those who govern them, who are quite unready for the asceticism and privation that her own austere vision demands.\\nIt explains why the British Government is quailing at enforcing any of the measures to which it has, in effect, committed itself by promising net zero emissions by 2050.\\nThis is in any case parochial: the UK contributes little more than one per cent of global CO2 emissions.\\nChina not only produces 27 per cent of the total (fair enough, given the size of its population) but has almost 250 gigawatts of new coal power in planning or development \u2014 an increase which itself exceeds the entire U.S. coal-fired energy capacity.\\nChina is definitely not buying Greta's sermons, regarding them with almost as much hostility as it did those of Christian missionaries, whom it often slaughtered.\\nWhen Thunberg told China to 'change course', Beijing's state-backed English language newspaper, Global Times, quoted one of its ministers that this was 'an attempt to deprive Chinese people of the right to improve their quality of life'.\\nAnd this Chinese equivalent of the BBC's World Service went on: 'Thunberg, who started skipping school for her climate protests, is merely 18 years old. She is short of sufficient academic knowledge and study.'\\nYou couldn't imagine anything like that ever being allowed to be spoken on the BBC, which ranks Thunberg along with Packham as ecological prophets whom the laity should not presume to question. (Thunberg guest-edited the Today programme in 2019.)\\nSay what you like about the pious platitudinisers of Thought For The Day: at least we are allowed to mock them.", "image": [["Chris Packham wants us all to change our wicked ways to avoid the planet being engulfed in flames through (he says) excessive use of fossil fuels", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/09/00/46445493-9875005-image-m-7_1628464645378.jpg"], ["Lord (Ian) Botham said the Springwatch presenter 'promotes holidays for the rich that encourage people to go on very long flights'", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/09/02/46445533-9875005-Lord_Ian_Botham_said_the_Springwatch_presenter_promotes_holidays-a-39_1628473360525.jpg"], ["Greta Thunberg definitely knows how to communicate her own terror at the alleged imminence of a planet in flames", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/09/00/46445497-9875005-image-a-6_1628464643038.jpg"], ["Alok Sharma, whom the Prime Minister appointed 'president' of the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow,\u00a0has over the past seven months jetted to at least 30 nations", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/09/02/46445543-9875005-The_same_question_might_be_asked_of_Alok_Sharma_whom_the_Prime_M-a-38_1628473360523.jpg"], ["Weirdly, however, a number of figures in the Church of England have made common cause with the neo-pagans of Extinction Rebellion.", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/09/09/46457825-9875005-image-a-2_1628498144296.jpg"], ["The Bishop of Liverpool, Paul Bayes (centre), led 20 vicars in reading the complete Book of Revelation \u2014 on the same platform as various XR doomsday cultists had been performing a ritual they called a 'die-in'", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/09/00/46445531-9875005-image-a-10_1628464731229.jpg"], ["Extinction Rebellion protesters dressed as zombies outside Queensland Parliament House in Brisbane", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/09/00/46445517-9875005-image-a-12_1628464795440.jpg"], ["Demonstrators stand outside the Bank of England in London and protest against the role of banks in the climate crisis", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/09/02/46445525-9875005-Demonstrators_stand_outside_the_Bank_of_England_in_London_and_pr-a-37_1628473360519.jpg"]], "author": ["Dominic Lawson for the Daily Mail"], "date": "2021-08-09"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9932885/Extinction-Rebellion-mob-throw-fake-blood-Standard-Chartered-bank.html": {"title": "The VERY recognisable face of Extinction Rebellion protests, 31, who is a vegan politics student, takes her clothes off to 'draw attention to the climate crisis' and says her FATHER supports her topless stunts", "subtitle": "Politics student Laura Amherst, 31, of Brighton, strips off again with just two XR stickers covering her breasts.

Demonstrators daubed paint on the Queen Victoria Memorial in front of the palace gates and dyed its fountain water red.\\nThe protesters, from an offshoot group called Animal Rebellion, held banners reading Animal Agriculture: A Royal Blood Bath.\u00a0The fountain vandals were immediately arrested.\\nThousands of people have been trapped in gridlock in the centre of the city as traffic was halted and public transport held up in the groups's week of protest.\\nYesterday demonstrators, estimated to be in the low thousands, also blocked off Hyde Park Corner and protested at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.\\nAnd in response to a video showing activists in a bizarre performance centred around a broccoli, policing minister Kit Malthouse tweeted: 'Please go back to your homes and jobs Extinction Rebellion and let all those cops get back to fighting crime.'\\nThe video, from a previous protest in London by the group, recently went viral after being posted online again. It includes people crowding around the vegetable and pointing at it. At one point, one covers it with a hat.\\nActress Emma Thompson also urged the public to join Extinction Rebellion's protests yesterday.\\nThe 62-year-old, who was previously mocked for travelling 5,400 miles from Los Angeles to the group's climate protests in London by private jet in 2019, said people must 'help in whatever ways they can'.\\nShe said in a video yesterday that the activists were not 'dropout, anarchistic outsiders', adding: 'They are rebels, if you like, who have the greatest cause in human history, nothing less than the survival of the planet.'\\nThe Metropolitan Police said they arrested seven protesters yesterday, bringing the week's total to 289.", "image": [["Extinction Rebellion climate activist Laura Amherst, 31, poses next to a police officer during the XR

This is local people's council tax.\\n'Westminster and the City of London are considered very wealthy areas, but I want to remind people that actually it's not all about wealth.\\n'There are major areas of deprivation in central London and 25 per cent of homes are social rented.\\n'The wealthy who live here have gone for the summer, so it's those who live here permanently and can't escape who are living with this so-called 'beautiful chaos'.'\\nExtinction Rebellion started a fortnight of action earlier this week and brought parts of London, including Oxford Circus and the West End, to a standstill.\\nThe action began on Monday when protestors set up a giant pink table by Leicester Square in a bid to encourage 'crisis talks' and asking the Government to 'come to the table'.\\nThe group said the demonstration was to urge\u00a0the UK Government to immediately stop all new fossil fuel investments.\\nOn Tuesday, four members of Extinction Rebellion Fashion Action glued themselves to the front door of Selfridges on Oxford Street.\\nThey were wearing a dress which displayed the messages: 'Fashion is addicted to dirty oil' and 'Code red for fossil fuel fashion'.\\nOther members of the protest poured fake oil over the activists and then proceeded to pour fake oil over the windows of the iconic British department store to further highlight the fashion industry's increasing reliance on fossil fuels, they said.\\nThe following day a large number of protestors blocked Oxford Circus with another giant pink table with a banner reading 'come to the table'.\\nA group also gathered outside the Brazilian Embassy and another group gathered at Piccadilly.\\nElsewhere, demonstrators from sister group Animal Rebellion were joined by some XR activists and glued themselves to tables in the Leicester Square McDonalds in a bid to encourage the fast food giant to switch to a plant based menu.\\nThe Metropolitan Police have arrested 236 people for a variety of offences in connection with the demonstrations since Sunday.\\nIn response to yesterday's action, a spokesman for the force said: 'Officers encouraged people to leave but as the assembly did not disperse conditions were imposed at 15.47hrs under s14 of the Public Order Act.\\n'Officers subsequently began arresting those who refused to comply, and specially trained officers are safely removing those locked on or glued in situ.\\n'This is a complex operation, where the safety of the public and those protesting is actively taken into consideration.'\\nAn Extinction Rebellion spokesman said: 'As Westminster Council will confirm, the \u00a350,000 figure was a 'service' cost, meaning the total cost of council services that were temporarily redeployed during our two-week October 2019 protests.\\n'There was no additional money spent by the council and no additional cost to the taxpayer.\\n'The 120 tons of rubbish collected took place over a two-week period. To put that figure into comparison, during London's New Year celebrations 2016-17, Westminster cleared up 85 tons of rubbish from just one night.\\n'As anyone who has been to an Extinction Rebellion protest will know, we are scrupulous about clearing up after ourselves and ask rebels to respect the spaces they're in and take their rubbish home.
