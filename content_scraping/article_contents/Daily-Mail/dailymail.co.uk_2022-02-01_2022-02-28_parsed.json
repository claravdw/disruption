They also show that we need to do significantly more to stop the greatest crime in humanity.\u2019\\nJust Stop Oil has been on a major recruitment drive in recent weeks. Despite numerous arrests for taking part in protests and an increasing \u2018cancel culture\u2019 on campuses, Hallam was allowed to seek support at several universities including Edinburgh and Glasgow.\\nThe group\u2019s strategy includes forming regional groups and recruitment teams to hold more than 20 meetings a week. Later this month, it will demand that the Government make a \u2018meaningful statement to Just Stop Oil\u2019. If no such undertaking is made, a campaign of civil resistance will be announced.\\nThe first phase would include blocking oil refineries, storage units and nearby motorways. The next move \u2013 Phase 2A \u2013 would see activists sitting in petrol forecourts as well as \u2018tanker-surfing and spray-paint(ing) filling points\u2019. Phase 2B, presumably an escalation of the protest, is simply described as \u2018high stakes resistance against oil\u2019.\\nThe unlikely venue for one of last week\u2019s meetings was a community centre in the picturesque town of Wallingford, near Oxford, which drew a 50-strong crowd of polite, mask-wearing residents.\\nPromoted through leaflets and on Facebook, it began chaotically after Hallam was stuck on a train in Reading and, ironically, had to be picked up and driven to the event by a fellow activist.\\nAs an intruder blared out a radio at full volume from the back of the room in a bid to drown out the proceedings, one of the organisers, Sarah Webb, was flustered as she prepared to read Hallam\u2019s speech. \u2018Oh God, it really is the end of the world now,\u2019 she muttered.\\nBut while she admitted to being \u2018really quite nervous\u2019, Webb is hardly a shrinking violet. The 50-year-old, who works as a special educational needs tutor for young children and is also involved in XR, was arrested last August after locking herself to a giant pink table in Central London for 21 hours.\\nWhen she attended court a month later, she wore the red uniform of an oppressed character from Margaret Atwood\u2019s dystopian novel The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\\nTo her relief, Hallam, 55, arrived after a few minutes and soon set about whipping up his audience. \u2018What I\u2019m here to tell you tonight is you have an absolute responsibility to take action on the greatest act of injustice and obscene evil in the history of humanity,\u2019 he said.\\n\u2018I\u2019m not mincing my words tonight. What else is it that we face? What other description can we give to COP26, which knowingly, in full knowledge of the science, decided to condemn the next generation to a world that is uninhabitable. A world of starvation, rape and slaughter.\u2019\\nSuggesting that joining the protest could enhance supporters\u2019 employment prospects, he added: \u2018No one is going to lose their job for campaigning on the climate, whatever it says in your contract. If anything, it\u2019s going to promote your career because it shows you\u2019ve got guts.\\n\u2018This is quite a tangent, but I think it\u2019s quite amusing \u2013 my partner, a co-founder of XR, put it on her CV and she\u2019s in middle-management of a non-governmental organisation. She\u2019s 24.\u2019\\nHallam\u2019s colourful rhetoric has landed him in trouble in the past. In January, he claimed in a controversial Facebook post that failing to engage in climate action was comparable to making a cup of tea while \u2018your daughter is being raped\u2019. The same month, students at Warwick University cancelled Hallam\u2019s visit after the Jewish Society said he had \u2018a history of Holocaust minimisation and trivialisation\u2019. It was prompted by an interview in 2019 when Hallam claimed the Holocaust was \u2018almost a normal event\u2019 and \u2018just another f***ery in human history\u2019. He later apologised.\\nSpeaking to the undercover reporter in Wallingford, Hallam said: \u2018What we\u2019re talking about tonight is 3,000 arrests, not a big number\u2026 There were 150 students in Edinburgh University this week signing up to get arrested. We can do it, it\u2019s peanuts.\u2019\\nAnd for anyone concerned about the prospect of arrest? \u2018Everyone has a great time because it\u2019s like being a kid again, it\u2019s adrenaline,\u2019 he replied.\\nOne activist, Oxfordshire vicar Tim Hewes, even cited wellbeing perks. The 71-year-old retired dentist made international headlines last year when he sewed his lips together in a bloody protest against media mogul Rupert Murdoch. He previously glued himself to furniture at the City of London Magistrates\u2019 Court.\\n\u2018I felt an amazing sense of liberation and I felt alive on the actions,\u2019 he told the reporter on Wednesday. \u2018For me, being active [with XR] is good for my mental wellbeing.\u2019\\nFor her part, Webb said: \u2018I\u2019m middle-aged now, I\u2019m 50 years old, and it\u2019s quite exciting to be naughty and getting into shenanigans. You\u2019ve got this beautiful supportive community and I don\u2019t get that in the wider world. We\u2019re in a real bubble of love and it feels fantastic.\u2019\\nAt a student Just Stop Oil meeting in South London on Tuesday, held in a local church, three young recruiters trotted out a similar line, albeit in slightly stronger terms, by saying that joining up had helped them realise \u2018that not everyone is a f***ing Nazi\u2019.\\nAnd while the overwhelmingly middle-aged activists in Wallingford were enticed to attend further meetings with the promise of pizza, the student recruiters chattered excitedly about a \u2018huge party\u2019 in Manchester where an organiser would likely \u2018spike people with acid\u2019.\\nOne recruiter, a former student nurse from Ireland, recalled spending the night in a police cell after scaling a Government building. She said the experience was \u2018all right\u2019 because the police gave her \u2018blankets and hot drinks\u2019.\\nThe young activists claimed 400 students had already committed to getting arrested for the campaign and that they hoped to recruit 1,000 students to block oil sites and paralyse the country.\\nThe Bournemouth talk on Thursday followed a similar structure. Held in a damp-smelling pub on the high street, it began with another student reeling off catastrophic science literature before launching into their havoc-causing plans.\\n\u2018What we are doing is disrupting infrastructure. So it\u2019s sitting in the road, it\u2019s putting our bodies in the way of vehicles getting to the infrastructure, it\u2019s stopping it [the oil sites] running. We\u2019re escalating the issue of oil,\u2019 said XR activist George Gaillet.\\nWhen the discussion moved to blocking a local oil plant, Dorset activist and Insulate Britain PR manager Melissa Carrington said: \u2018I think the key thing about Just Stop Oil is it\u2019s got to cause economic disruption. It\u2019s not symbolic, creative stuff, it\u2019s stuff that\u2019s going to disrupt, and that\u2019s what we need to focus on.\u2019\\nUnsurprisingly, some audience members at the meetings were daunted at the prospect of getting arrested for the climate. Hallam tried to assuage these concerns with promises of ruthless professionalism. \u2018You\u2019ll get an email and all the rest of it, it\u2019s very organised,\u2019 he insisted.\\n\u2018This is a British civil disobedience organisation, you don\u2019t just turn up. After that you go to a non-violence day and you learn how to be non-violent in case someone provokes you. You learn about the legal side, the practicalities, you learn about who you\u2019re going in the road with, it\u2019s like designing a little mini-holiday\u2019.\\nFor those unconvinced, Hallam suggested smaller, supportive roles: \u2018Whenever there\u2019s a group of people doing civil disobedience, there\u2019s three or four people who will do the transport, meet them outside a police station, walk their dog or donate money. That\u2019s what it means by having this community.\u2019\\nJust Stop Oil declined to comment.\\nThe ringleader who set up extinction rebellion\\nFailed organic farmer Roger Hallam, the ringleader of Just Stop Oil, is a veteran of climate activism.\\nThe 55-year-old staged his first protest aged 15 by sitting down in the middle of Central Manchester, his home city.\\nSince then, his stunts have included plotting to fly a drone into Heathrow Airport and spray-painting a listed building at King\u2019s College London, where he studied for a PhD in civil disobedience.\\nHallam, who has spent time in prison for his activism, co-founded the protest group Extinction Rebellion (XR) in 2018, which became notorious for blocking bridges and roads.\\nThe tactics caused mayhem and Hallam was slammed for saying he would block ambulances carrying dying patients. He went on to form Insulate Britain in 2021, which saw protesters block motorways and glue themselves to planes, trains and streets.\\nA tall, drawn figure with a shabby grey ponytail, when he stood as an independent candidate for the European Parliament in the London constituency three years ago, he received just 924 of the more than 2.2 million votes that were cast.\\nAccording to his official website, by failing to tackle the climate issue \u2018we risk unspeakable horrors such as mass slaughter, starvation and rape, and the rise of fascistic regimes as the scramble for water and land takes off\u2019.\\nThe reverend who SEWED HIS LIPS TOGETHER\\nOther campaigners include Reverend Tim Hewes, a retired dentist and part-time clergyman from Oxfordshire.\\nAn active member of climate groups including XR and Christian Climate Action, Hewes sewed his lips together last year and stood outside the News Corp offices in London to protest against \u2018the silencing of climate science\u2019 by media mogul Rupert Murdoch. The gruesome images made headlines across the world.\\nHe spent two weeks in jail last year for glueing himself to furniture at City of London Magistrates\u2019 Court. On the day of his arrest, he spoke about the planet \u2018being choked with carbon dioxide emissions, covered in tarmac, plundered of its limited resources, the deep oceans filled with plastic, biodiversity squandered by a shameful disregard for the integrity and preciousness of all non-human creatures\u2019.\\nOnce inside, Hewes went on hunger strike in solidarity with people who lost their lives from famine. The 71-year-old, who is often seen sporting a dog collar, was also arrested in 2019 for blocking several roads in Westminster. While Reverend Hewes has \u2018permission to officiate\u2019 at services in the Church of England\u2019s Oxford diocese, he does not have a parish of his own.\\nThe teacher who glued herself to a table\\nSpecial educational needs tutor Sarah Webb, who lives in Wallingford, Oxfordshire, helps children with English and maths. But after growing increasingly concerned about the climate issue, the 50-year-old decided she could better help the younger generation by becoming a zealous eco-activist.\\nWebb was arrested in August last year after glueing herself for 21 hours to a giant pink table plonked in Central London by XR.\\nMs Webb also dressed up in the red-and-white stripes of the Where\u2019s Wally? children\u2019s character and stood outside local council offices carrying a sign that read \u2018Where\u2019s Walli Town Council\u2019s climate action plan?\u2019\\nSpeaking at a protest at ExxonMobil\u2019s oil refinery in Fawley, Hampshire, last year, she said: \u2018I am here to stand up for what is right. Our Earth, our home is on fire, and all we hear from our Government is \u201cblah, blah, blah\u201d \u2013 empty promises and failed targets.\\n", "image": [["Roger Hallam, a co-founder of Extinction Rebellion (XR) and Insulate Britain, predicted that up to 3,000 activists could be arrested over two weekends in March", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/05/21/53822773-10480761-image-m-26_1644097502303.jpg"], ["The sinister plan emerged during three meetings last week attended by an undercover MoS reporter.

They were still not speaking about the situation yesterday, it is understood.\\nSenior police figures also questioned the 'fishy' timing of the Labour Mayor's decision amid claims of a 'stitch-up' over the Partygate scandal, in which the Prime Minister could be implicated.\\nConfirming the pension Dame Dick will receive, Metropolitan Police Federation chairman Ken Marsh said: 'When she has left she will receive an annual pension that amounts to two-thirds of her final salary, so it'll be around \u00a3160,000.'\\nA City Hall source said: 'There will be a due process and details about remuneration will be agreed in due course.' Yesterday Susan Hall, Tory chairman of the London Assembly's police and crime committee, said: 'Cressida has been treated appallingly by Sadiq. She has been thrown under a bus. Of course she is entitled to a payoff. She has been effectively dismissed by the Mayor.\\n'It will leave a void at the top as opposed to a properly managed handover, which is no way to run Britain's biggest police service.'\\nBut former Tory MP Harvey Proctor, who was falsely accused during the Met's botched VIP sex abuse investigation Operation Midland, argued she should be denied the cash: 'This is a dreadful reward for failure. It's appalling that the public purse should have to foot the bill to the tune of over \u00a3500,000.'\\nYesterday sources said Dame Cressida was heartbroken by the loss of her dream job and could still refuse the payoff because she is 'not motivated by money'.\\nA senior police source suggested the timing of her departure could be linked to Partygate.\\nHe said: 'The pre-emptive move discredits her and the force, which gives Labour an opportunity to question the findings when the Partygate report comes out and claim it is a whitewash if Boris isn't forced to quit.' A Whitehall source added: 'There's something fishy going on. We are trying to work out what happened between Sadiq and Cressida.\\n'Earlier this week he'd been saying she had 'days and weeks' to come up with a reform plan, and then barely a day later he cans her. It's all very odd.'\\nBut, referring to a report on the conduct of officers at Charing Cross police station released this month, a City Hall source said: 'It has nothing to do with the investigation into Downing Street.\\n'Sadiq was disgusted and angry that the Independent Office for Police Conduct report took him back to the dark days of policing in the 1970s and 1980s. Change had been promised. It hadn't been delivered.'\\nDame Cressida's departure follows a barrage of criticism of the force including over its handling of the case of Sarah Everard who was murdered by a serving Met officer.\\nThe force has also been criticised for being slow to investigate reports of parties in Downing Street and Whitehall in breach of Covid restrictions.\\nThe final straw, however, was a report by the police watchdog which exposed violently racist, misogynist and homophobic messages exchanged by officers based at Charing Cross police station.\\nHome Secretary Priti Patel has warned the\u00a0new Met chief must be prepared to tackle the 'policing culture' which has left the country's biggest force reeling from a series of scandals.\\nMs Patel, who is beginning the search for a successor to Dame Cressida, said it would require 'strong and decisive leadership' to rebuild public confidence in the force's 'integrity and professionalism'.\\nIn a statement, said she would be looking for someone who could deliver results for the public.\\n'Following a series of appalling incidents and too many historical cases involving serving Met Police officers, it is clear that strong and decisive new leadership will be required to restore public confidence in our largest police force,' she said.\\n'The public in London and across the entire country must once again have confidence in the integrity and professionalism of the police officers who serve them.\\n'Policing culture and conduct have rightly come under scrutiny. Be in no doubt that a new leader must tackle these institutional issues.'\\nShe added: 'I will appoint a Commissioner who will deliver for the public whom our police serve and represent. Beating crime, preventing crime, protecting our citizens, our streets and communities at a time when this Government is investing record sums into the police, is paramount.\\n'And above all that's what I - and the public across the country - will want from the country's most senior police officer: someone focused on the basics of reducing violence in the city, tackling the abuse of women and girls, ridding our streets of drugs, knives and weapons, saving lives and protecting the public from the those who wish to do them harm.'\\nHome Office sources said Ms Patel was angered by Mr Khan's failure to inform her that he had called Dame Cressida to a meeting on Thursday afternoon which she considered 'rude and unprofessional'.\\nDame Cressida, however, chose not attend after reportedly being informed that Mr Khan had no confidence in her plans for reform.\\nSources close to the mayor said that it had been a regular bilateral meeting and that it was up to Dame Cressida to inform Ms Patel of her decision herself.\\nRank and file officers expressed dismay at Dame Cressida's departure, with the chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, Ken Marsh, saying she had been treated unfairly.\\nMr Marsh told the PA news agency: 'She was much loved across the rank and file of the Metropolitan Police Service.\\n'We feel the way she has been treated is wholly unfair and we did believe that she was the person who could take us through this and bring us out the other side.'\\nBut former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor, whose house was raided by officers from the Met's failed Operation Midland, launched in reaction to false allegations by jailed fantasist Carl Beech about a murderous VIP paedophile ring, said he was delighted by the news.\\n'It is now time to clean the Augean stables so that a full inquiry can be conducted on all her personal mistakes,' he said.\\nHarriet Wistrich, director of the Centre for Women's Justice (CWJ) charity, said: 'There were far too many stories of officers accused of violence and abuse still in their jobs, and of whistleblowers victimised instead of listened to.\\n'Cressida Dick's response to these series of stories has been wholly inadequate, and her description of Wayne Couzens as a 'wrong un' meaningless, next to the mounting evidence of multiple allegations of abuse and policing failures to tackle violence against women and racism.'\\nJuly 22, 2005:\u00a0Jean Charles de Menezes is shot dead on a train at Stockwell Underground station in South London.\\nThe shooting happened when counter-terrorism officers mistook the innocent electrician for one of the terrorists behind an attack on the capital a day earlier.\\nMr de Menezes, a Brazilian working in the capital, was blasted in the head seven times by police at Stockwell station after being followed by officers from his home nearby.\\nMr de Menezes's family led a long campaign calling for police officers to be prosecuted for the shooting and criticising Scotland Yard for its handling of the operation, which was led at the time by Dame Cressida.\\nDame Cressida was cleared of all blame by later inquiries, but Mr de Menezes' family expressed 'serious concerns' when she was appointed Met Commissioner in 2017.\\nThe top policewoman told the Mail in 2018: 'It was an appalling thing \u2013 an innocent man killed by police. Me in charge. Awful for the family and I was properly held to account. We learned every lesson that was to be learned'.\\nApril 2017: Appointed as first female Metropolitan Police commissioner with a brief to modernise the force and keep it out of the headlines.\\nApril 2019: Extinction Rebellion protesters bring London to a standstill over several days with the Met powerless to prevent the chaos. Dame Cressida says the numbers involved were far greater than expected and used new tactics but she admits police should have responded quicker.\\nSeptember 2019: Her role in setting up of shambolic probe into alleged VIP child sex abuse and murder based on testimony from the fantasist Carl Beech is revealed but she declines to answer questions.\\n2020: Official report into Operation Midland said Met was more interested in covering up mistakes than learning from them.\\nFebruary 2021: Lady Brittan condemns the culture of 'cover up and flick away' in the Met and the lack of a moral compass among senior officers.\\nMarch: Criticised for Met handling of a vigil for Sarah Everard, where officers arrested four attendees. Details would later emerge about how her killer, Wayne Couzens, used his warrant card to trick her into getting into his car.\\nJune: A \u00a320million report into the Daniel Morgan murder brands the Met 'institutionally corrupt' and accuses her of trying to block the inquiry.

Stephen Pritchard, 62; Rev Sue Parfitt, 79; and Theresa Norton, 63.\\nOwen Greenhall, who represented Ms Causby, as well as Dr Warner and Mr Buse, said the latter two intended not to break the court injunction again after previously receiving a prison sentence in December for another breach.\\nHe said Mr Buse had decided to 'move away from direct action' after seeing the impact of the earlier court proceedings on his family.\\nDr Warner, who was handed a two-month prison term in December and released from custody on January 14, will 'continue to do everything she can to help save lives', Mr Greenhall added.\\nAsking judges not to impose on her an immediate prison term, Mr Greenhall said the Bristol GP took 'conscientious actions'.\\nSome protesters in court wore orange hi-vis vests, while Mr Taylor appeared from the courtroom dock as he continues to serve a six-month prison sentence imposed in November for a different injunction breach.\\nRepresenting himself, he told the judges that he had 'nothing to hide' and admitted breaching the injunction on October 29.\\nHe said lockdown measures at HMP Thameside meant his prison time was 'much more severe'.\\nBranding the injunction 'absurd', he said his ability to support his pregnant partner was also 'severely restricted'.\\nHe told the court: 'I find it sickening, sad that people are unnecessarily suffering in their millions... increasingly in this country', adding that there was a 'climate emergency' that 'our Government has openly recognised yet is not doing anything even remotely significant about'.\\nInsulate Britain has said the four protesters who have glued themselves together 'will remain outside of the court until they are removed or the court is no longer in session'.\\nGabriella Ditton, 28, addressed the court emotionally this afternoon, telling Lord Justice Davis she was \u2018ashamed\u2019 that she was not outside with her fellow activists.\\nShe said her mother has terminal brain cancer and \u2018that\u2019s the thing that\u2019s stopping me from being outside with those people.\\nMs Ditton added: \u2018I am not scared to go to prison. I am a lot more frightened about what happens if we don\u2019t act on this issue.

Others were jailed or given suspended sentences in December for a similar breach.\\nThe total number of people charged with contempt of court due the protests now stands at 27 \u2013 with ten of today's defendants facing court for the first time with Insulate Britain, and eight returning for a second time.\\nThe 19th one - Taylor - faces a third hearing. He is currently serving a six-month sentence given at the first hearing for the M25 injunction in November, and will be transferred from HMP Thameside for his days in court.\\nTaylor received the longest prison sentence given to an Insulate Britain activist so far. He will have served half the sentence in two weeks and is due to be released \u2013 but now faces more time being added to his sentence.\\nAn Insulate Britain spokesman said: 'The longest sentence imposed on an Insulate Britain supporter to date was six months, handed down to Ben Taylor in November. He will have served half the sentence in two weeks and is due to be released.\\n'However, he faces the prospect of having additional time added to his sentence, even if the other defendants receive suspended sentences, as we understand that there is no legal precedent for a justice giving a suspended sentence to anyone currently in prison.'\\nA total of ten Insulate Britain activists have received prison sentences so far with a further eight protesters being given suspended sentences. Taylor is the only person from the campaign that remains in prison.\\nAmong those also appearing today is Causby, a cafe worker and volunteer from Manchester, who said in an Insulate Britain press release issued yesterday: 'Tomorrow's hearing at the High Court will be the third time that the government is using civil law, rather than trial by jury, to try and halt our campaign of resistance.\\n'They know that a jury of ordinary people would not convict us. A jury would agree that the government is failing to protect the people of this country from the misery of fuel poverty and the growing threat of societal collapse caused by the climate crisis.'\\nAnd Reverend Parfitt, an Anglican priest from Bristol, said: 'When I was sitting on the motorway , I knew why I was there - to flag up justice for the poor, to witness to the truth of the climate crisis.\\n'But now I am being deprived of my human rights to protest and to manifest my religious belief by this civil case against me brought by National Highways.\\n'I want to tell the public to wake up. Do whatever you can to put pressure on the government to take meaningful action to slow down the impending climate catastrophe.'\\nAlso speaking ahead of the case was Whipster, a retail worker from Canterbury in Kent, who said: 'It's my second time in this court for breaching injunctions.\\n'Last time I asked the prosecution team to do the moral thing and close their laptops and bin their papers and walk away. Fifty days have passed since then. What a waste of intellect, skills and resources.\\n'Just imagine if that prosecution team were instead focussed on helping dig us out of this self-inflicted hole of climate and environmental collapse? It's very sad.\\n'I've made a moral choice. It's a case of watching this slow-burn genocide and destruction of our natural world unfurl, or resist. I am a parent. I have no choice but to sacrifice my liberty and my future for the next generation'\\nInsulate Britain, an offshoot from the Extinction Rebellion campaign group, is calling on the UK Government to implement policy and funding for a national home insulation programme starting with all social housing.\\nIt wants the UK government immediately to promise to fully fund and take responsibility for the insulation of all social housing in Britain by 2025, and produce 'within four months a legally binding national plan to fully fund and take responsibility for the full low energy and low carbon whole-house retrofit, with no externalised costs, of all homes in Britain by 2030 as part of a just transition to full decarbonisation of all parts of society and the economy'.\\nLast week,\u00a0Transport Secretary\u00a0Grant Shapps said it 'doesn't make sense' for climate activists to glue themselves to roads when campaigning for better home insulation, or complain about HS2 when they are keen for others to travel in a more eco-friendly way.\\nHe added that many\u00a0environmental protesters are 'anarchists' who 'just want to find a basis upon which to take extremist action'. Mr Shapps told the Centre Write magazine, from the centre-right think tank Bright Blue, that people should not even 'try to understand' such tactics.\\nAsked about how to tackle disruption from climate activism, including the Insulate Britain protests, he said: 'Unsurprisingly there's a little loophole in the law that makes it difficult to directly prosecute people gluing themselves to the road. That is being fixed through the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill.'\\nHe added: 'We will always look to take action to protect hardworking Brits who want to get around. It's inexcusable, as there are perfectly legitimate legal routes you can follow to protest or to make change happen, but gluing yourself to a road isn't one of them, and doesn't even really stack up because they're actually going on about insulating houses.'\\nMr Shapps was also asked about 'so-called climate activists and environmentalists in the political sphere', who have criticised the likes of HS2.\\n'A lot of these people are basically just anarchists who just want to find a basis upon which to take extremist action,' he said.\\n'This is why gluing yourself to a road when you're actually talking about insulating homes, or complaining about HS2 when you claim to want to allow people to travel in a more environmentally friendly way, doesn't make sense. We shouldn't try to understand it.\\n'If what you want to do is dig a tunnel and live in it to protest, the pretext is not what's important to them. Clearly HS2 is a massive project, it's the biggest building construction project in Europe. It's also the most environmentally friendly large building project there has ever been.'\\nEarlier this month, Downing Street defended measures to tackle protesters' 'guerrilla tactics' after peers gutted the legislation with a series of defeats for the Government.\\nHome Secretary Priti Patel accused peers of siding with 'vandals and thugs' after a string of defeats saw the House of Lords

Dame Cressida confirmed her departure from Scotland Yard after losing Sadiq Khan's confidence.", "text": "In the end, it is a wonder she survived in the job so long.\\nOnly last year, her force was officially branded 'institutionally corrupt'. Incredibly, despite such a devastating finding, she did not resign.\\nInstead 'Teflon' Dame Cressida Dick has made a habit of trotting out humiliating apologies, for both recent and historical blunders, including admitting that the Sarah Everard debacle had brought 'shame' on the Metropolitan Police.\\nThe daughter of two Oxford academics, Dame Cressida, 61, joined the Metropolitan Police in 1983 after graduating from Oxford University with a degree in agriculture and forest sciences. Apart from a six-year spell at Thames Valley Police, she has spent her entire policing career at Scotland Yard.\\nHer first arrest, which came in her very first beat patrol in London's Soho in 1983, was of a man using a screwdriver to jemmy open the coin box in a telephone kiosk.\\nLater, at Bramshill Police College in 1995, she was the only woman out of ten officers chosen for fast-track promotion training, but she has been determined that her sex would not define her.\\nThe police chief was one of the first female undergraduates at Oxford's Balliol College in 1979. She always played cricket, football and rowed with 'the boys', saying it never bothered her. Later on, Dame Cressida was given time out to study for a qualification in criminology at Cambridge.\\nAt the Metropolitan Police, she was given responsibility for Operation Trident \u2013 which investigated gun and gang crimes \u2013 counterterrorism, the 2012 London Olympics, and ended up as the country's principal hostage negotiator.\\nBut since rising from an impressive rookie cop in the 1980s to the very top of British policing at the country's largest force, Dame Cressida has been embroiled in at least seven career-defining disasters.\\nThe wonder is that the first of them didn't spell the end.\\nTube death blunder\\nIn July 2005, Dame Cressida was in charge of the operation which saw blameless electrician Jean Charles de Menezes shot dead on a Tube train at Stockwell station in south London after he was mistaken for a terrorist who was under surveillance.\\n11AM: 'I expect to be held to account, it's a big job and I'm quite used to being asked to account for things and I will go on doing so in the future.'\\n11.07am: 'I have absolutely no intention of going and I believe that I am leading a real transformation in the Met.'\\n11.33am: [Why she thinks she is the right person to lead Met] 'I have been commissioner since 2017. I'm very, very proud of many, many of the things that we have achieved in that time.'\\n\\nIt almost finished her career, and she says she thinks about it 'very often'.\\nThe armed officers believed him to be a fugitive suicide bomber who had escaped after failed attacks in London two weeks after the carnage of the 7/7 bombings.\\nDame Cressida was the 'gold commander' on the botched operation, and immediate lethal force \u2013 a shot to the head \u2013 was supposedly required because any other action risked setting off the suicide jacket.\\nNo officer, including Dame Cressida, faced any charges, and no one was reprimanded.\\nThe Met was found guilty of breaching health and safety laws and putting the public at risk, and was fined \u00a3175,000 and ordered to pay \u00a3385,000 costs from taxpayer funds. The Met chief was personally exonerated, but the shame of it lingered.\\nOperation Midland\\nIn 2014, Dame Cressida sanctioned the creation of Operation Midland, a disastrous investigation into spurious VIP child sex abuse allegations that saw completely innocent men pursued by the force.\\nFive years later, when the embarrassing operation began seriously unravelling, she refused to allow an inquiry into the conduct of officers involved.\\nThis was despite former High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques revealing how officers had used false evidence to obtain a search warrant for the raids. Dame Cressida said that an inquiry would be 'completely improper'.\\nWhile some of her calamities pre-dated her stint as Commissioner, this one sat squarely within her reign. A report in 2020 found the Metropolitan Police was more interested in covering up mistakes than learning from them.\\nThe Hampshire home of the Queen's confidant, Lord Bramall \u2013 who was also former head of the Armed Forces \u2013 had been invaded by police with search warrants in the early hours on the basis of spurious allegations of abuse by paedophile Carl Beech, a palpable fantasist.\\nAfter the Daily Mail exposed him, Beech was jailed. Before he died, D-Day hero Lord Bramall told his son Nick that 'he had never been so mortally wounded, even in battle'.\\nFormer Tory MP Harvey Proctor, who received a substantial payout after his life was ruined by the disastrous paedophile inquiry, last night expressed his delight at Dame Cressida's downfall.\\nHe was among seven high-profile victims of the Met \u2013 including Baroness Lawrence, whose son Stephen's 1993 murder investigation was botched by racist officers \u2013 who last year came together in a Mail interview to accuse Dame Cressida of having 'presided over a culture of incompetence'.\\nXR protests\\nIn 2019, Dame Cressida's force was widely condemned for its 'light-touch' policing of Extinction Rebellion protests, which blocked several key areas of London.\\nUnder her watch, career eco-activists from XR and its off-shoot Insulate Britain were given free rein to cause mayhem.\\nAmbulances were stopped from getting through, while businesses and workers were forced to halt their activities.\\nA low point came when police were filmed asking road-blocking protesters if they needed anything \u2013 rather than just arresting them.\\nDaniel Morgan\\nPerhaps the most jaw-dropping condemnation of Dame Cressida came in June of last year when an official report described her force as 'institutionally corrupt'.\\nAnd far from blaming the fiasco on a predecessor, it concluded that she had personally placed 'hurdles' in the way of a search for the truth about the death of Daniel Morgan \u2013 a private investigator who was brutally murdered in a south London pub car park in 1987.\\nDame Cressida was accused of 'obfuscation' for thwarting the Morgan inquiry team's attempts to access sensitive documents, leading to delays that cost the taxpayer millions. The report by Baroness O'Loan found that Scotland Yard was 'institutionally corrupt'.\\nThe Met has never found Mr Morgan's murderer, but there were long-standing allegations of police corruption over the killing and the aftermath.\\nMr Morgan's brother Alastair also joined Baroness Lawrence, Harvey Proctor and Lord Bramall in a devastating and unprecedented joint interview with the Daily Mail.\\nThey all signed a letter to the PM demanding Dame Cressida's resignation. Instead she clung on.\\nSarah Everard\\nThe brutally horrific murder of Sarah Everard in March last year by serving Met firearms officer Wayne Couzens went from disastrous to worse for Dame Cressida. She faced a clamour to quit after he was exposed as the killer.\\nIt then emerged Couzens had not been vetted properly and Met officers had failed to investigate after he was reported flashing women days before the murder.\\nBut perhaps the worst moment for the Commissioner was her officers' heavy-handed policing of a vigil for the murdered woman at Clapham Common in South London.\\nPhotographs of protesting women being pinned down by arresting officers who cited Covid restrictions on gatherings were published around the world, sparking condemnation.\\nWhen Couzens was convicted, it was dubbed Scotland Yard's 'darkest day'. Dame Cressida stood outside the Old Bailey and humbly admitted the murder had corroded trust in the police and brought 'shame' on her force.\\nMurder photos\\nIn December last year, two Scotland Yard officers who took photos of the bodies of two murder victims were jailed.\\nThe sisters who died \u2013 Nicole Smallman, 27, and 46-year-old Bibaa Henry, were black and there were accusations of racism. 2021 was also the force's worst ever year for teenage killings, with 30 deaths.\\nCharing Cross\\nEarlier this month, details emerged of horrific messages exchanged by officers at Charing Cross police station, by an official watchdog report.\\nSome 14 officers were investigated as a result, with two found to have a case to answer for gross misconduct.\\nOne was sacked and another resigned before he would have been dismissed. Another two had already left, while in some of the other cases the Independent Office of Police Conduct found 'no further action should be taken'.\\nIncredibly, nine officers kept their jobs and two were promoted \u2013 but their sickening WhatsApp messages exposed an ongoing culture of racism, sexism and bullying.\\nIt appears this sickening episode was the straw which finally broke the back. For, by the end, it was clear that confidence in the police chief had gone.\\nSo who might take over the troubled Met? Favourites to replace Cressida Dick include an ex-counter-terror chief who threatened to jail journalists or a Merseyside cop who said violent criminals were 'NOT inherently bad people'\\nThe leadership of the Metropolitan Police was thrown into chaos last night after Dame Cressida Dick's bombshell resignation as Scotland Yard boss.\\nConfidence in the force has been shaken in recent years by a series of scandals including the murder of Sarah Everard by depraved cop Wayne Couzens, the disastrous probe into fake VIP child sex abuse claims, and allegations of racism, sexism and homophobia within the ranks.\\nDame Cressida Dick, who became the first woman to head the Met Police\u00a0in 2017, said she had 'no choice but to step aside' after losing Sadiq Khan's confidence.\\nFollowing the announcement, questions quickly turned to who would succeed her during a tumultuous time for Britain's biggest police force.\\nLikely replacements for the \u00a3230,000-a-year role range from a counter-terror chief who threatened to jail journalists and blamed terrorism on a lack of social mobility to a Merseyside cop who said violent criminals were 'not inherently bad people'.\\nSpeaking to MailOnline in September, a senior MP said they feared the current crop of senior police may be 'too woke'. 'The problem with Cressida is she has presided over a series of disasters, and then says it is not her fault,' the MP said. 'It is difficult when we always take the same view that operational decisions are a matter for the police not politicians.'\\nHere, MailOnline goes through the list of likely candidates to succeed Dame Cressida.\\nNeil Basu: Anti-terror chief who called for journalists to be prosecuted after publishing leaked cables criticising Trump\\nNeil Basu is the Met's former head of counter-terrorism and the most senior serving British officer of Asian heritage.\\nHe also served as the assistant commissioner for specialist operations until September 2021, which included responsibilities around national security, and had originally been tipped for the top job in 2017 before losing out to Dame Cressida.\\nIn February this year, he called for laws in the Equality Act 2010 that restrict positive discriminations to be relaxed in order to boost the number of BAME recruits. He was immediately shot down by policing minister Kit Malthouse, while Home Secretary Priti Patel was also said to be against the idea.\\nMr Basu faced fresh accusations of meddling in politics in July 2019, when he threatened to prosecute journalists for publishing leaked cables from Britain's ambassador to the US, Sir Kim Darroch.\\nFormer Tory cabinet minister David Davis said the intervention 'strayed well beyond his brief', and represented an attack on the free Press.\\nMr Basu's comments came after Scotland Yard launched a probe to find who leaked Sir Kim's memos calling the Trump administration 'clumsy and inept'.\\nMr Basu, who has spent his whole career at the Met, made another controversial intervention in August that year when suggested homegrown terrorism was fuelled by a lack of social mobility and inclusion. He said better education and opportunities for young people would do more to fight terrorism than 'the policing and state security apparatus put together' \u2014 adding that he was not trying to excuse any acts of violence.\\nHe also said British Muslims should not be forced to 'assimilate', adding: 'Assimilation implies that I have to hide myself in order to get on. We should not be a society that accepts that.'\\nA 2019 profile of Basu in the Mail On Sunday described him as well-liked within the force and by intelligence officials at MI5. But he has attracted criticism for some of his operational decisions, most notably as head of Operations Weeting, Elveden and Tuleta. The three inquiries into phone hacking, computer hacking and alleged payments to police officers by newspapers cost around \u00a319.5million and were criticised for criminalising journalists.\\nMr Basu also raised eyebrows when he criticised the Prevent programme \u2013 which tries to detect and deradicalise Muslim extremists \u2013 as 'toxic'.\\nA Hindu, born to an Indian doctor father and a white British mother, he has said he has encountered racism over most of his life. He grew up in Stafford, where he studied at Walton High School before reading economics at Nottingham University.\\nHe became a Met police officer in 1992, serving first as a beat bobby in Battersea, South London, then swiftly moving through the ranks as a borough commander in Barnet, North London, and a Commander of South London in 2012.\\nAndy Cooke: Former Merseyside chief who insists even violent criminals are 'not inherently bad people'\\nWhile head of Merseyside Police, Andy Cooke sparked anger when\u00a0he said even violent criminals are 'not inherently bad people' and he'd rather pump billions into cutting poverty than upholding the law.\\nThe officer, marking his retirement as Chief Constable of Merseyside Police, said if he was given a \u00a35 billion budget to cut crime, he would spend \u00a31 billion on crime and \u00a34 billion on tackling poverty.\\nHe now serves in the role of Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary and Inspector of Fire and Rescue Authorities in England. He will be overseeing inspections primarily in the North of England.\\nMr Cooke was chief constable for five years, during which time he has overseen the jailing of dozens of multi-millionaire drug laws, including Liverpool's most notorious drugs boss Liam 'the Lam' Cornett, who was transported to court in a huge armed convoy every day, and the jet-setting Mulhare brothers, who were caught abroad in Thailand after being informed on by a 'supergrass'.\\nMurderers jailed during his tenure include George Leather, 60, who brutally killed his Asda worker wife, 56, by stabbing her 300 times in an 'episode of unspeakable and barbaric savagery', and Robert Child, 37, who was jailed for life for striking his 64-year-old mother Janice with a hammer 31 times.\\nTory MP Andrew Bridgen said of Mr Cooke's plans for the police budget: 'In that case would he be quite happy to sack 80% of the officers. Reducing poverty is not a function of the policing budget, it's the job of other agencies and government.\\n'I'm not convinced that this change would be welcomed by the vast majority of the UK population. They want to see the police protecting citizens and property and crime. He sounds like someone who would have taken the knee for BLM and defunded the police.'\\nUnder Mr Cooke, Merseyside Police gained a reputation for tough policing and for being a keen user of stop-and-search powers. He was also the first commander of Merseyside's Matrix unit, set up to tackle gang crime and violence.\\n\\nSimon Byrne: Top Northern Ireland cop 'with a reputation for being like Darth Vader'\\nSimon Byrne became chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland in May 2019, arriving at the force with 36 years of policing behind him.\\nAfter holding senior roles at GMP and the Met, he became chief constable of Cheshire Police from 2014 to 2017. That role ended in controversial circumstances after he was accused of bullying and humiliating staff.\\nA misconduct hearing was told he had a reputation for being like Darth Vader and treated junior officers and staff like 'roadkill'.\\nThe hearing was told he handed pictures of Dad's Army characters to officers after he became angry when flooding made him late for work.\\nHowever, he was cleared of misconduct, with the tribunal concluding that much of what was claimed was either exaggerated or most likely didn't happen.\\nDuring his time as chief constable,\u00a0Mr Byrne revealed he had considered breaking the law in order to hire more officers from ethnic minorities. At that time the force only had three black officers.\\nHe told the BBC in 2017 that the law should be changed in England 'for a certain period of time' to allow the hiring of minority candidates to speed up. This would ensure that 'for every white officer, we recruit one black officer.'\\nMr Byrne said: 'I've even taken legal advice about breaking the law, which might sound crazy as a senior police officer.\\n'But if we're put under pressure to change, then what are the consequences, other than reputational, from breaking the law?'\\nUnder current equality rules employers cannot employ a job applicant because of characteristics like race, sexual orientation or gender, if other candidates are better qualified.\\nAt PSNI he attracted controversy for\u00a0suggesting the children of paramilitaries could be taken into care.\\nHe was also forced to apologise\u00a0after tweeting a photo of himself with officers holding rifles outside a PSNI station on Christmas Day, the BBC reported.\\nMartin Hewitt: NPCC chief who backed crackdown on Covid sceptics and said officers felt 'undervalued' amid pay row\\nAs chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) throughout the Covid crisis, Martin Hewitt has made a number of high-profile interventions in politics.\\nAmid fury last year at officers being hit by a pay freeze, Mr Hewitt told Priti\u00a0Patel that many officers believed the decision was 'unfair' and they felt 'undervalued' after their efforts during Covid.\\nMr Hewitt said: 'For many it feels unfair and that their contribution is undervalued.\\n'And, unlike other parts of the public service, officers do not have the option of industrial action to make their case more strongly.\\n'As the Government makes spending decisions over coming months, we urge you to fund a settlement which properly reflects the important and complex work police officers do, and starts to address the pay shortfall.'\\nIn January 2021, he backed a crackdown on lockdown sceptics and said officers\u00a0would no longer 'waste time' trying to reason with them amid soaring death rates.\\nSpeaking at a Downing Street press briefing, he gave examples of shocking 'irresponsible behaviour' from people not heeding warnings - even with more than 1,200 people dying every day.\\nThey included a \u00a330-per-head boat party in Hertfordshire with more than 40 people, a Surrey house party whose host tried to claim it was a business event and a minibus full of people from different households caught travelling from Cheltenham into Wales for a walk.\\nMr Hewitt was appointed in April 2019. He began his policing career with Kent Police in 1993 and transferred to the Metropolitan Police Service in 2005.\\nAs an Assistant Commissioner for five years, he led frontline and local policing, specialist crime and professional standards.\\nHe led the national police response to adult sexual offences and kidnap between 2014 and 2019, and served as a Vice-Chair for the NPCC from 2015 before taking on the chairmanship.\\nMatt Jukes: Assistant commissioner credited with leading crackdown on Rotherham child grooming gangs\\nMatt Jukes joined South Yorkshire police in 1995 three years after graduating with a degree in mathematics from Oxford.\\nHe worked as a detective and rose through the ranks to represent UK police forces at G8 meetings and lead on national anti-terror strategy.\\nMr Jukes is best known for tackling Rotherham grooming gangs while borough commander\u00a0in the Yorkshire town from 2006 to 2010.\\nMore than 1,000 children were exploited in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013, with local authorities, schools and police among agencies that failed to tackle the problem.\\nA report on the scandal by Professor Alexis Jay suggested that Mr Jukes' leadership marked a point where police became more proactive in dealing with the abuse.\\nAfter serving in South Yorkshire Police, he moved to South Wales, with the police and crime commissioner there Alun Michael backing him as an outstanding leader.\\nMr Jukes worked his way up to the top post in South Wales Police, becoming Chief Constable in January 2018.\\nHe is also chairman of Police Sport UK.\\nMr Jukes moved to the Met in\u00a0November 2020.

I think we should just be quite clear about that. We are not seeing one-off incidences, this is not isolated. We have seen now too, too many times, too many instances where, in policing, we just see the most appalling behaviours, the most appalling conduct.\\n'I also think it shows a failure of leadership in some quarters.\\n'So you've asked me the question about institutional misogyny within policing. There are cultural issues there. What we saw in the IOPC report absolutely points to, I'm not even going to say just misogynistic behaviours, I think it's cultural and attitudinal.'\\nThe Home Secretary said she has confidence in Metropolitan Police boss Dame Cressida Dick but 'change is required'.\\nMs Patel said: 'I've always said that I'm confident in her and her work, but that also means that change is required.\\n'There are lots of issues, it's not straightforward with the Met, and there are lots of issues there where we need to see major, major significant improvements: culture, delivery, accountability and protecting the streets.'\\nTwo inquiries are under way looking at the culture within the Met - one by Baroness Casey that was organised by the force itself, and a Home Office probe headed by Dame Elish Angiolini that is looking at the failures behind the rape and murder of Sarah Everard by a serving officer.\\nShadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the IOPC's report had uncovered 'truly appalling behaviour' and urged the Home Office to address issues in policing.\\nShe told the BBC's Today programme: 'Officers talking and joking about raping or beating their wives, and using homophobic insults and awful racism - you cannot ever tolerate this kind of abuse, racism or misogyny, it must have no place in policing and be rooted out.'\\nShe called for action not just from the police, but also from the Home Office, saying there must be an overhaul of training and faster vetting of officers.\\nThe IOPC published the messages after a series of nine investigations into the behaviour of Metropolitan Police officers based in a now disbanded Westminster team between 2016 and 2018, sparked by a later disproven claim that an officer had sex with a drunk person at a police station.\\nFourteen officers were investigated by the watchdog, of whom two were found to have a case to answer for gross misconduct. One was sacked and another resigned before he would have been dismissed.\\nNine remain serving officers, while another is working as a contractor in a staff role.\\nIOPC regional director for London Sal Naseem said that the two accused of gross misconduct were the worst perpetrators, but could not confirm whether those still serving were responsible for any of the offensive comments published.\\nHe told Good Morning Britain: 'What I do know is that there were nine investigations here. The two officers who were sacked for gross misconduct were the worst perpetrators of some of these exchanges.'\\nIn response to an urgent question about the report in the Commons, policing minister Kit Malthouse said the document 'makes for extremely disturbing reading' and that he 'cannot begin to describe my horror' at the revelations it contains.\\nHe said he will look at a request by MP Dr Matthew Offord for a new offence to be created to make it illegal for anyone in a position of trust to try to have sexual contact with someone they have met through work.\\nThe IOPC report included messages by an officer bragging about sleeping with a sex worker he had met while on duty.\\nThe latest developments in the Met Police provoked a swift rebuke from Home Secretary Priti Patel today.\\nAppearing in front of the Home Affairs Select Committee, Ms Patel said she was 'appalled and sickened' by the findings of yesterday's report, blaming a\u00a0'failure of leadership' for the rotten culture of racism, misogyny and homophobia at Scotland Yard.\\nIn her comments today, Ms Patel also suggested a Royal Commission could eventually be set up to explore failings across the police and wider criminal justice system. She also said spiking could be made a specific criminal offence following a series of reported incidents in nightclubs,\u00a0although she warned the public 'not to expect an announcement tomorrow'.\\nAsked specifically about the report on the behaviour of officers at Charing Cross police station, she said:\u00a0'There are problems with the culture within the Metropolitan Police. I touched on this last year after the murder of Sarah Everard, which also exposed a range of issues\\n'There are some very serious and significant matters that need further investigation, primarily because we're not seeing one-off instances. We've seen now too many instances of the most appalling behaviours. I also think is shows a failure of leadership in some quarters.'\\nAsked to clarify what she meant by this, Ms Patel said:\u00a0 'In terms of failure of leadership, the fact that those behaviours were allowed to take place, there were no disciplinary actions, no-one saying that's wrong, that is actually about leadership in policing. So that's superiors, that's seniors, line managers calling that behaviour out and actually stopping it in the first place.'\\nWhen chairwoman Diana Johnson asked whether that included the commissioner, Ms Patel replied: 'It is across the board.'\\nThe Home Secretary said she would continue to be 'very challenging' with Dame Cressida but still had confidence in her.\\nA spokesperson for Sadiq Khan confirmed he had had a 'very frank discussion' with the commissioner earlier today 'which lasted for well over 90 minutes'.\\n'The mayor made clear to the commissioner how angry he is with a return to the bad days of the Met of his childhood in the 1970s and 80s, and that neither he nor Londoners will put up with this,' they added.\\n'He has put the commissioner on notice. He said the Met needs to urgently show it has an effective plan for restoring the trust and confidence of Londoners in the police and to drive out the culture of racism, homophobia, bullying and misogyny which clearly still exists within its ranks.'\\nA source close to Mr Khan also said: 'If the commissioner is not able to do so, then the mayor will have to consider whether she is the right person to lead the change needed at the Met.'\\nMeanwhile, Leroy Logan, founder of the Black Police Association and a former superintendent, said 'the rot had set in' at the Met, which had created 'safe havens for predators'.\\nCalling for 'ethical leadership and systemic changes', he told the BBC's Newsnight programme:\u00a0'Over the last few years you've had Met officers doing amazingly bad things like photographing dead bodies, and then the Sarah Everard\u00a0case.\\n'I was at Charing Cross from 2000 and 2004 and we never had a hint of that. Then again, we were supervisors on top of our game who had to know what was happening with our teams so we could spot these things early.\\n'I think the culture has become more immoral. There seems to be safe havens for predator types \u2013 sexists, misogynists and racists that aren't being challenged \u2013 so I'm wondering what's happened to the inspectors and supervisors.'\\n\\nCressida Dick's reign as Metropolitan Police commissioner has been overshadowed by controversy over bungled operations and investigations:\\nApril 2017: Appointed as first female Metropolitan Police commissioner with a brief to modernise the force and keep it out of the headlines.\\nApril 2019: Extinction Rebellion protesters bring London to a standstill over several days with the Met powerless to prevent the chaos.

He was handed a 12-month conditional discharge and an indefinite restraining order.\\nThe grim revelations are just the latest in a series of scandals for beleaguered Met Police chief Dame Cressida Dick - who is already under pressure over her late decision to investigate the Downing St Partygate scandal.\\nSpeaking to MPs yesterday, Home Secretary Priti Patel said she was 'appalled and sickened' by the findings of yesterday's report into the disgraceful behaviour of more than a dozen officers - including McLoughlin-Goodchild - at Charing Cross police station, including sick jokes about rape, 'killing black children', and 'f****** gays'.\\nMcLoughlin-Goodchild was later sacked by the Met, but remained under investigation for a series of offensive messages that were the subject of an inquiry by the Independent Office of Police Conduct,\u00a0The Times\u00a0reported.\\nThe watchdog found officers at Charing Cross had exchanged sickening messages about rape, 'killing black children', and 'f****** gays'.\\nA male officer told a female colleague 'I would happily rape you' and 'if I was single I would happily chloroform you'.\\nAnother officer was known as 'mcrapey raperson' because of his reputation for ''harassing [women], getting on them, do you know what I mean being like, just a d***''.'\\nMs Patel told the Commons Home Affairs Committee that the problem was not isolated and there had been 'too many instances where, in policing, we just see the most appalling behaviours'.\\nAsked by committee chairwoman Diana Johnson if she thinks police forces are 'institutionally misogynistic', Ms Patel said: 'There are problems with the culture, and some aspects of the culture, within the Metropolitan Police.\\n'I do think there are some very, very serious and significant matters that need, not just following up, but further investigation.\\n\\n'We're not seeing one-off incidences. I think we should just be quite clear about that. We are not seeing one-off incidences, this is not isolated. We have seen now too, too many times, too many instances where, in policing, we just see the most appalling behaviours, the most appalling conduct.\\n'I also think it shows a failure of leadership in some quarters.\\n'So you've asked me the question about institutional misogyny within policing. There are cultural issues there. What we saw in the IOPC report absolutely points to, I'm not even going to say just misogynistic behaviours, I think it's cultural and attitudinal.'\\nThe Home Secretary said she has confidence in Metropolitan Police boss Dame Cressida Dick but 'change is required'.\\nMs Patel said: 'I've always said that I'm confident in her and her work, but that also means that change is required.\\nStephen Lawrence was murdered by a gang of racists while waiting for a bus in Eltham, south-east London, in 1993.\\nThe bungled initial investigation into his death was beset by claims of racism, corruption and incompetence.\\nIt took nearly 20 years for two of his five or six killers finally to be brought to justice, after double-jeopardy rules were amended to allow new evidence to be presented at a later trail.\\nIn 1997 after his inquest, the Daily Mail ran a dramatic front-page publicly accusing five men of his murder, which was praised by Stephen's mother Doreen.\\nThe inquiry into the Met's handling of the case, led by high court judge William Macpherson, accused the force of 'institutional racism'.\\nIt made 70 recommendations including greater oversight of the police, greater powers to discipline officers, and the definition of a racist incident to be extended to 'any incident which is perceived to be racist by the victim or any other person'.\\nThe bombshell inquiry in 1999 paved the way for sweeping reform at Scotland Yard and led to the abolition of the double jeopardy law.\\n'There are lots of issues, it's not straightforward with the Met, and there are lots of issues there where we need to see major, major significant improvements: culture, delivery, accountability and protecting the streets.'\\nTwo inquiries are under way looking at the culture within the Met - one by Baroness Casey that was organised by the force itself, and a Home Office probe headed by Dame Elish Angiolini that is looking at the failures behind the rape and murder of Sarah Everard by a serving officer.\\nShadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the IOPC's report had uncovered 'truly appalling behaviour' and urged the Home Office to address issues in policing.\\nShe told the BBC's Today programme: 'Officers talking and joking about raping or beating their wives, and using homophobic insults and awful racism - you cannot ever tolerate this kind of abuse, racism or misogyny, it must have no place in policing and be rooted out.'\\nShe called for action not just from the police, but also from the Home Office, saying there must be an overhaul of training and faster vetting of officers.\\nThe IOPC published the messages after a series of nine investigations into the behaviour of Metropolitan Police officers based in a now disbanded Westminster team between 2016 and 2018, sparked by a later disproven claim that an officer had sex with a drunk person at a police station.\\nFourteen officers were investigated by the watchdog, of whom two were found to have a case to answer for gross misconduct. One was sacked and another resigned before he would have been dismissed.\\nNine remain serving officers, while another is working as a contractor in a staff role.\\nIOPC regional director for London Sal Naseem said that the two accused of gross misconduct were the worst perpetrators, but could not confirm whether those still serving were responsible for any of the offensive comments published.\\nHe told Good Morning Britain: 'What I do know is that there were nine investigations here. The two officers who were sacked for gross misconduct were the worst perpetrators of some of these exchanges.'\\nIn response to an urgent question about the report in the Commons, policing minister Kit Malthouse said the document 'makes for extremely disturbing reading' and that he 'cannot begin to describe my horror' at the revelations it contains.\\nHe said he will look at a request by MP Dr Matthew Offord for a new offence to be created to make it illegal for anyone in a position of trust to try to have sexual contact with someone they have met through work.\\nWhatsApp conversation between two police officers:\\nA separate WhatsApp conversation between two police officers:\\nA further WhatsApp conversation between two police officers:\\n\\nMessages sent by a male officer to a female officer:\\nFurther messages sent about women, include:\\nThe IOPC report included messages by an officer bragging about sleeping with a sex worker he had met while on duty.\\nThe latest developments in the Met Police provoked a swift rebuke from Home Secretary Priti Patel.\\nMs Patel said she was 'appalled and sickened' by the findings of yesterday's report, blaming a\u00a0'failure of leadership' for the rotten culture of racism, misogyny and homophobia at Scotland Yard.\\nIn her comments, Ms Patel also suggested a Royal Commission could eventually be set up to explore failings across the police and wider criminal justice system.\\nShe also said spiking could be made a specific criminal offence following a series of reported incidents in nightclubs,\u00a0although she warned the public 'not to expect an announcement tomorrow'.\\nAsked specifically about the report on the behaviour of officers at Charing Cross police station, she said:\u00a0'There are problems with the culture within the Metropolitan Police. I touched on this last year after the murder of Sarah Everard, which also exposed a range of issues\\n'There are some very serious and significant matters that need further investigation, primarily because we're not seeing one-off instances.\\n'We've seen now too many instances of the most appalling behaviours.\\n'I also think is shows a failure of leadership in some quarters.'\\nAsked to clarify what she meant by this, Ms Patel said:\u00a0 'In terms of failure of leadership, the fact that those behaviours were allowed to take place, there were no disciplinary actions, no-one saying that's wrong, that is actually about leadership in policing. So that's superiors, that's seniors, line managers calling that behaviour out and actually stopping it in the first place.'\\nWhen chairwoman Diana Johnson asked whether that included the commissioner, Ms Patel replied: 'It is across the board.'\\nThe Home Secretary said she would continue to be 'very challenging' with Dame Cressida but still had confidence in her.\\nMeanwhile, Leroy Logan, founder of the Black Police Association and a former superintendent, said 'the rot had set in' at the Met, which had created 'safe havens for predators'.\\nCalling for 'ethical leadership and systemic changes', he told the BBC's Newsnight programme:\u00a0'Over the last few years you've had Met officers doing amazingly bad things like photographing dead bodies, and then the Sarah Everard\u00a0case.\\n'I was at Charing Cross from 2000 and 2004 and we never had a hint of that. Then again, we were supervisors on top of our game who had to know what was happening with our teams so we could spot these things early.\\n'I think the culture has become more immoral.\\n'There seems to be safe havens for predator types \u2013 sexists, misogynists and racists that aren't being challenged \u2013 so I'm wondering what's happened to the inspectors and supervisors.'", "image": [["Cressida Dick was summoned yesterday for a public dressing down by London Mayor Sadiq Khan", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/03/09/53630861-10471697-Cressida_Dick_was_summoned_yesterday_for_a_public_dressing_down_-m-14_1643880711234.jpg"], ["Dal Babu OBE, who served with the force for 30 years, said confidence in the police was at an 'all-time low'", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/03/09/44337469-10471697-Dal_Babu_OBE_who_served_with_the_force_for_30_years_said_confide-a-15_1643880723502.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/03/10/53722675-10471697-image-a-52_1643883416289.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/03/10/53722671-10471697-image-m-53_1643883470191.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/03/10/53722661-10471697-image-a-46_1643883373704.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/03/10/53722657-10471697-image-m-40_1643883310550.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/03/10/53722653-10471697-image-m-35_1643883266549.jpg"], ["McLoughlin-Goodchild - who served at Charing Cross police station - was later sacked by the Met", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/03/09/53689805-10471697-McLoughlin_Goodchild_who_served_at_Charing_Cross_police_station_-a-8_1643880572776.jpg"], ["James McLoughlin-Goodchild, a PC at Charing Cross police station, threatened to stab the woman and two other officers if they came to arrest him", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/03/09/53689803-10471697-James_McLoughlin_Goodchild_a_PC_at_Charing_Cross_police_station_-a-11_1643880606315.jpg"], ["Stephen Lawrence", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/03/10/9994440-10471697-Stephen_Lawrence_18_was_fatally_stabbed_by_a_gang_of_racists_in_-a-30_1643882731092.jpg"], ["These are MailOnline mock-ups of WhatsApp conversations that were published in the IOPC report.

He was contacted by desperate postmasters numerous times about the scandal.\\nYou might have imagined, therefore, that Sir Ed would have been among the first to speak out. But you'd be wrong.

The Home Secretary found out when the commissioner rang to say she was resigning. It is not helpful, but I'm afraid we have a political mayor playing politics with the police. Did he even tell the Palace? The commissioner is appointed by the Queen.\\n'It could be quite destabilising. How does this square with the fact that just last year he was arguing she should be given a three-year contract extension? The mayor owes the people of London an explanation.'\\nThe Home Secretary will oversee the appointment of the new commissioner and more details on how she will set about searching for a replacement are expected to be confirmed in due course.\u00a0She has final decision on the next appointment, although the process requires her to consult Mr Khan as Mayor, who said he would be 'working closely' with the Home Secretary to find a successor.\\nLabour sources also said Sir Keir Starmer had also not been informed of Dame Cressida's departure in advance, the Telegraph reported.\\nLord Greenhalgh, a Home Office minister who worked with Mr Johnson at City Hall, tweeted: 'Cannot believe how badly Mayor Sadiq Khan has managed his relationship with the Metropolitan Police and their Cmr Cressida Dick who has just resigned. This Mayor of London has no idea how to lead or to manage. Shockingly bad.'\\nWhile former commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson accused Mr Khan of 'political opportunism' and 'grandstanding'.\\n'For Sadiq Khan to go public in the way he did smacked of a politician putting up a smokescreen rather than having an appropriate and sensible conversation in private to lead to a dignified outcome,' he said, adding: 'It appeared to be political opportunism and grandstanding by Sadiq Khan. I think that is very sad.'\\nDame Cressida has faced a series of scandals during her time leading the Met \u2014 most recently concerning violently racist, misogynist and homophobic messages exchanged by officers based at Charing Cross police station that were published by a watchdog.\\nThere was also fury over the rape and murder of Sarah Everard by depraved cop Wayne Couzens, as well as the force's heavy-handed actions following her death in tackling a Clapham Common vigil held in her memory during Covid restrictions, and issuing clumsy advice telling women in trouble to flag down a passing bus that later had to be retracted.\\nDame Cressida's critics praised her resignation last night, calling it 'long overdue'.\\nFormer Conservative MP Harvey Proctor, whose house was raided by officers from the Met's failed Operation Midland launched in reaction to false allegations by jailed fantasist Carl Beech about a murderous VIP paedophile ring, said he was delighted by the news.\\n'It is now time to clean the Augean stables so that a full inquiry can be conducted on all her personal mistakes,' he said.\\nOne former colleague told the Telegraph:\u00a0'She has had multiple flesh wounds and strikes but because she is personable, resilient, presents well in the corridors of power and is liked by her frontline officers, she survived.\\n'There is a myth about Cressida\u2019s popularity within the Met. She is not a great communicator within the organisation. A lot of people within the Met were fed up with the lack of clarity and direction'.\\nHarriet Wistrich, director of the Centre for Women's Justice (CWJ) charity, said: 'There were far too many stories of officers accused of violence and abuse still in their jobs and of whistle-blowers victimised instead of listened too.\\n'Cressida Dick's response to these series of stories has been wholly inadequate and her description of Wayne Couzens as a 'wrong un' meaningless next to the mounting evidence of multiple allegations of abuse and policing failures to tackle violence against women and racism.'\\nDame Cressida announced she was stepping down from the job on Thursday just hours after insisting she had no intention of going during an interview with the BBC.\\nMiss Patel has blamed 'failures of leadership' for the rotten culture at the Met, including by the commissioner herself.\\nDame Cressida began her career in London as a constable before holding a variety of posts on her way to becoming Scotland Yard's first female chief. However, her leadership of the force came under mounting public scrutiny following a number of controversies.\\nPerhaps the most damaging blot on her card is that of the shambolic Operation Midland \u2014 the Met's \u00a31milliion investigation into spurious VIP child sex abuse allegations.\\nInnocent men, including the late Lord Brittan and Mr Proctor, were pursued by the force in a probe sanctioned in 2014 while Dame Cressida was an assistant commissioner. The Met's star witness Carl 'Nick' Beech was later revealed to be a serial liar and was jailed after police investigating his claims discovered his deceit.\\nOn Dame Cressida's watch, ticketless football hooligans broke past Wembley's security barriers during the Euros last year and stormed the grounds ahead of England's clash with Italy. The Met was accused of not having enough officers on duty to create a 'ring of steel' around he venue to hold back the frenzied England supporters.\\nDame Cressida has also faced questions about why Miss Everard's evil attacker Couzens was not arrested before he kidnapped, raped and murdered the 33-year-old marketing manager for flashing offences previously reported to the police.\\nAnd last summer, the force was branded 'institutionally corrupt' by an independent panel investigating police inquiries into the unsolved murder in the 1980s of private detective Daniel Morgan.\\nDoubling-down on her record as commissioner last night, Dame Cressida said: 'Undertaking this role as a servant of the people of London and the UK has been the greatest honour and privilege of my life. Throughout my career I have sought to protect the people of this wonderful thriving and diverse city.\\n'There have been many tough calls. And many challenges.

I am not satisfied with the Commissioner's response.\\n'On being informed of this, Dame Cressida Dick has said she will be standing aside.

They urgently need new leadership that will change the culture and rebuild the public trust and confidence that officers need to do their jobs and keep us all safe.\\nThe partner of Stephen Port's youngest victim has welcomed Dame Cressida Dick's resignation and called it a 'small justice for the victims' of the serial killer.\\nDame Cressida quit as Metropolitan Police Commissioner last night after losing the support of London Mayor Sadiq Khan over her plan to reform the force following a string of scandals and accusations of a toxic working culture.\\nRicky\u00a0Waumsley, whose 21-year-old partner Daniel Whitworth was murdered by Port in Barking, east London, said his first thought when he heard the news was 'about time' and that he hoped more resignations would follow.\\nHe added: 'She had clung on to that position so tight when, all around her, the officers she was in charge of have been racist, homophobic and sexist.'\\nMr Waumsley had called for her to quit in December after an inquest jury found police failures had likely contributed to the deaths of Mr Whitworth and those of two more of Port's victims.\\nPort, known as the Grindr killer, drugged, raped and killed four men between June 2014 and September 2015, and sexually assaulted more than a dozen others.\\nThe inquests into the four deaths revealed that officers failed to carry out basic evidence gathering such as examining Port's laptop, testing DNA on bedsheets on which two of the bodies were found, and checking the veracity of a fake suicide note found with Mr Whitworth's body.\\nSeventeen officers were investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), and nine were found to have performance failings.\\nNone of the nine were disciplined or lost their jobs, and five had been promoted.\\n\\n'No one handpicked by Boris Johnson would have the credibility needed for this big and important task. There must be no interference from Number 10 in the appointment and Boris Johnson should publicly recuse himself from this decision.'\\nAs Scotland Yard chief, Dame Cressida has managed to find a way to ride-out the controversies which have mounted up across her 40-year career \u2014 in turn winning praise for her resilience and even earning the nickname 'Comeback Cressida' in some circles.\\nAn independent panel on the death of private investigator Daniel Morgan found that the Met had prioritised its reputation over finding Mr Morgan's killer \u2014 sparking allegations of institutional corruption in Scotland Yard.\\nIn its bombshell report, the Daniel Morgan Independent Panel concluded forms of police corruption had hampered both the murder inquiry, and its own work to investigate the reasons why the case was never solved. Singling out Dame Cressida for blame, the report said she had not given a 'reasonable explanation' for blocking access to computer data and delaying the release of files, the last of which were provided only in March.\\nA Home Office source said there were 'serious concerns with the Met's leadership and how it responded to failings' \u2014 although Miss Patel and Boris Johnson later expressed confidence in Dame Cressida.\\nThe commissioner apologised for past mistakes, saying: 'It is a matter of great regret that no one has been brought to justice and that our mistakes have compounded the pain suffered by Daniel's family. For that I apologise again now.\\n'I have been personally determined that the Met provided the panel with the fullest level of co-operation in an open and transparent manner, with complete integrity at all times.'\\nBut amid calls for her resignation at the time, Dame Cressida said: 'I don't believe we are institutionally corrupt. No, I don't accept that. I have the deepest feelings for Daniel Morgan's family. They have shown extraordinary grit and determination and courage.\\n'Yesterday, I apologised again to them for our failings and the fact that we have not brought anybody to justice despite six investigations and countless other reviews and pieces of work.'\\nShe added: 'And for the fact that, in so doing and along the way, we have clearly, we the Met, my force, of which I'm very proud to be the Commissioner, we have caused them extra anguish. But I don't accept that we are institutionally corrupt, no.'\\nThe independent panel led by Baroness Nuala O'Loan found that the Met had put protecting its own reputation above finding Mr Morgan's killer.\\nThe panel's report said: 'Concealing or denying failings, for the sake of the organisation's public image, is dishonesty on the part of the organisation for reputational benefit and constitutes a form of institutional corruption.'\\nDame Cressida also came under the spotlight after it emerged that bosses at Scotland Yard missed three crucial clues about killer cop Couzens that could have seen him kicked out of the force before he murdered Miss Everard.\\nCouzens, who kidnapped, raped and murdered the marketing executive while she walked home from a friend's house in Clapham, was reported to bosses for allegedly slapping a female colleague's bottom at Bromley police station in 2018 \u2014 just weeks after he joined the force.\\nShortly after starting at Bromley in South London, the married killer allegedly stopped a female motorist and said her tax and insurance were out of date before making a note of her address so he could later pull up outside her house and leer at her.\\nCouzens, whose former colleagues at the Civil Nuclear Constabulary nicknamed him 'The Rapist' because of how he is said to have made female colleagues uneasy, is also accused of parking his patrol car by schools so he could watch mothers and sixth-formers.\\nSADIQ KHAN\\nLast week, I made clear to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner the scale of the change I believe is urgently required to rebuild the trust and confidence of Londoners in the Met and to root out the racism, sexism, homophobia, bullying, discrimination and misogyny that still exists.\\nI am not satisfied with the Commissioner's response.\\nOn being informed of this, Dame Cressida Dick has said she will be standing aside.

One was sacked and another resigned before he would have been dismissed. Nine remain serving officers, while another is working as a contractor in a staff role.\\nAsked if all of those involved in the Charing Cross incident should be sacked, Mr Khan told Today: 'I think Londoners can't understand why nine of these 14 police officers are still serving. I've asked that question.'\\nHe also told the programme: 'And by the way, I only discovered last week that two of them have been promoted.'\\nOne of the officers disciplined for their behaviour has since been promoted from the rank of constable to sergeant, it emerged last week. She was found to have committed misconduct for failing to report wrongdoing, yet the Met told the Guardian the promotion went ahead anyway, telling the paper that the officer 'attended a misconduct meeting and was given management action/advice about reporting wrongdoing'.\\nAnother officer, whose disturbing messages formed part of the inquiry, threatened to murder a female colleague while under investigation for sexually harassing her.\\nJames McLoughlin-Goodchild, a PC at Charing Cross, threatened to stab the woman and two other officers if they came to arrest him during a phone call with a sergeant to discuss an upcoming gross misconduct hearing.\\nA trial heard he said: 'I will kill them, I will murder them if I see them, I know where they live and what cars they drive. If they come to my home and arrest me they are going to get stabbed. I will not go to prison alive.'\\nThe officer was found guilty of sending an offensive, indecent, obscene or menacing communication after a trial at Hendon Magistrates Court in January 2019. He was handed a 12-month conditional discharge and an indefinite restraining order.\\nMeanwhile, new damning claims emerged last week about the behaviour of officers at Charing Cross, including allegations they slept with female suspects and called black colleagues 'monkeys'.\\nA 'toxic' culture existed at the station dating back to 2006, said the former constable, who asked to be referred to by her first name, Liz.\\nThe ex-officer said there was an 'awful' atmosphere at the station where men had sex with women in bathrooms, 'mercilessly bullied' a colleague and made 'cruel and sexual comments' about women in the street while senior leaders stayed silent.\\nShe said her male colleagues were like 'kids in a candy store' given the station's proximity to 'pubs, bars and party culture', with one sergeant bragging about seeing his favourite Russian escort at Spearmint Rhino.\\nThe IOPC watchdog said it would look into the shocking allegations. An officer who gave only her first name, Liz, told LondonWorld she witnessed appalling behaviour by male cops after graduating from Hendon Police College in the mid-noughties.\\nShe moved to another station in a different borough after two years and is now a writer living in Perth, Australia. She says she saw officers having sex down the station, caught a male cop in the act with someone he had arrested and she was victim to 'countless propositioning from male colleagues'.\\nAs the only woman in her team, she had to endure a night out at the Spearmint Rhino strip club where a sergeant bragged about having 'his favourite Russian girl'.\\nOn one occasion, she was sat in a carrier vehicle in Whitehall when all the male officers made lewd sexual comments about every woman that walked past.\\nBlack officers were referred to as 'monkeys' and officers said 'they better smile at night or we won't see them'.\\nAn autistic police community support officer was mercilessly bullied and 'mindf***ed' until he thought it was all part of him being 'part of the team', she claimed. She said she knew the behaviour was wrong but did not know who to turn to, fearing bosses would turn a blind eye and she would be ostracised by colleagues.\\nCressida Dick's ledger of failures: From the Met's disastrous probe into fake VIP child sex abuse to Sarah Everard's killing, the Daniel Morgan inquiry and 'institutional racism, sexism and homophobia'\\nDame Cressida Dick's shock resignation last night marks the end of a controversial chapter in the history of the Metropolitan Police.\\nAs Scotland Yard chief, Dame Cressida's tenure was plagued by a series of scandals \u2014 from Sarah Everard's killing by depraved cop Wayne Couzens, the Wembley security fiasco during the Euros and the force's bungled probe into fake VIP sex abuse claims, to heavy-handed policing during the pandemic and allegations of racism, sexism, homophobia and 'institutional corruption'.\\nBritain's most senior police chief dramatically resigned from the Met Police after losing the support of London Mayor Sadiq Khan\u00a0following the watchdog's report into the behaviour of officers at the Charing Cross police station.\\nThough Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel\u00a0paid tribute to Dame Cressida, her critics called her resignation 'long overdue' and said her departure would mark the beginning of proper reform at the force.\\nHere, MailOnline examines the many failings which have marked Dame Cressida's card.\\nOPERATION MIDLAND\\nThe Metropolitan Police has been mired in controversy since it launched an astonishing investigation into false allegations of child sex abuse at the heart of Westminster.\\nNamed Operation Midland, detectives probing claims made by serial liar Carl 'Nick' Beech conducted dawn raids at high-profile addresses including the homes of D-Day hero Lord Bramall, Lord Brittan and former Tory MP Harvey Proctor.\\nBeech falsely claimed that he and other boys were raped and tortured in the 1970s and 1980s and that one young boy was even murdered by members of a VIP paedophile ring. He is now serving an 18-year prison sentence for 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one count of fraud.\\nScotland Yard was heavily criticised in an independent review of the case by former High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques. His findings recommended that 'offences of attempting to pervert the course of justice be considered' against the two complainants, and this should be carried out by another police force.\\nIn September 2019, Dame Cressida's role in setting up the shambolic probe into alleged VIP child sex abuse and murder was revealed, but she declines to answer questions.\\nTwo years later, Lady Brittan condemns the culture of 'cover up and flick away' in the Met and the lack of a moral compass among senior officers.\\nThe same month a freedom of information request revealed an extraordinary spin campaign to ensure Dame Cressida was not 'pulled into' the scandal over the Carl Beech debacle.\\nSARAH EVERARD\\nBritain was shocked by the murder of Sarah Everard at the hands of depraved cop Couzens as she walked across Clapham Common in March last year.\\nA court heard that Couzens staged a fake arrest of Miss Everard using Covid emergency powers, before raping and killing her.\\nDame Cressida faced public fury after it emerged that Scotland Yard may have missed multiple opportunities to sack or prosecute Couzens.\\nCouzens was reported to bosses for allegedly slapping a female colleague's bottom at Bromley police station in 2018 \u2014 just weeks after he joined the force.\\nShortly after starting at Bromley in South London, the married killer allegedly stopped a female motorist and said her tax and insurance were out of date before making a note of her address so he could later pull up outside her house and leer at her.\\nCouzens, whose former colleagues at the Civil Nuclear Constabulary nicknamed him 'The Rapist' because of how he is said to have made female colleagues uneasy, is also accused of parking his patrol car by schools so he could watch mothers and sixth-formers.\\nDame Cressida faced calls to resign after officers conducted a heavy-handed crackdown on a vigil held for Miss Everard at Clapham Common after the 33-year-old's death.\\nAt the time, she defended the force's actions and dismissed 'armchair critics', raging: 'What has happened makes me more determined, not less, to lead my organisation.'\\nDANIEL MORGAN INQUIRY\\nLast summer, the force was branded 'institutionally corrupt' by an independent panel investigating police inquiries into the unsolved murder in the 1980s of private detective Daniel Morgan.\\nIn its bombshell report, the Daniel Morgan Independent Panel concluded forms of police corruption had hampered both the murder inquiry, and its own work to investigate the reasons why the case was never solved. Singling out Dame Cressida for blame, the report said she had not given a 'reasonable explanation' for blocking access to computer data and delaying the release of files, the last of which were provided only in March.\\nA Home Office source said there were 'serious concerns with the Met's leadership and how it responded to failings' \u2014 although Miss Patel and Boris Johnson later expressed confidence in Dame Cressida.\\nThe commissioner apologised for past mistakes, saying: 'It is a matter of great regret that no one has been brought to justice and that our mistakes have compounded the pain suffered by Daniel's family.

Their attempted attack followed the 7/7 atrocity which killed 52 people on Tubes and a bus in London earlier that month.\\nDame Cressida was cleared of all blame by later inquiries, but Mr de Menezes' family expressed 'serious concerns' when she was appointed Met Commissioner in 2017.\\nThe top policewoman told the Mail in 2018: 'It was an appalling thing \u2014 an innocent man killed by police. Me in charge. Awful for the family and I was properly held to account. We learned every lesson that was to be learned.\\n'My job was to stand up and be counted, tell the truth and carry on. If police officers fell to pieces or resigned when operations didn't go well, it wouldn't send out a good message.'\\nCHARING CROSS\\nA bombshell report by the IOPC watchdog exposed a cruel, toxic 'boys club' culture among officers at Charing Cross police station.\\nIt found cops made rape jokes, boasted about domestic violence and made vile racist remarks in WhatsApp exchanges.\\nGrim texts between officers about raping women, killing black children, pedophilia, Muslims, Auschwitz and disabled people were also published in the watchdog's report.\\nLast week, a former Met officer has come forward with new allegations of horrifying behaviour by officers at Charing Cross police station, including claims officers slept with female suspects and called black colleagues 'monkeys'.\\nA 'toxic' culture existed at the station dating back to 2006, said the former constable, who asked to be referred to by her first name, Liz.\\nThe ex-officer said there was an 'awful' atmosphere at the station where men had sex with women in bathrooms, 'mercilessly bullied' a colleague and made 'cruel and sexual comments' about women in the street while senior leaders stayed silent.\\nShe said her male colleagues were like 'kids in a candy store' given the station's proximity to 'pubs, bars and party culture', with one sergeant bragging about seeing his favourite Russian escort at Spearmint Rhino.\\nThe report sparked public fury and caused Mr Khan to put Dame Cressida 'on notice' to make serious reforms to the force. Days later, she resigned.\\nMET COPS SHARE PHOTOS OF MURDERED SISTERS\\nNicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry were stabbed to death by Danyal Hussein in Fryent Country Park in Wembley, north London, in June 2020, while out celebrating a birthday.\\nHowever, a report by the Independent Office for Police Conduct found the level of service provided by the Met over the weekend when they went missing was 'below the standard that it should have been'.\\nMet officers Jamie Lewis and Deniz Jaffer later admitted taking and sharing images of the scene where the sisters were murdered.\\nDame Cressida said at the time: 'My thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of Nicole and Bibaa for their tragic losses.\\n'The way we responded to information that Nicole and Bibaa were missing that weekend was below the standard we should have achieved and compounded the distress felt by their loved ones.\\n'While we know that very sadly Nicola and Bibaa had been murdered in the early hours of Saturday, 6 June 2020, before they were reported missing. If we had responded better we may have saved their friends and family immeasurable pain.\\n'I am very sorry that the level of service we provided fell short. We have contacted the family to ask if they will allow me or, if they prefer, another senior officer to visit them at a time that is right to apologise in person.'\\nHowever, the sisters' mother Mina Smallman called on Dame Cressida to resign, asking: 'This is the woman who is going to tackle what we are up against in the Met?'.\\nShe added: 'Time for her to go. Up until she did the statement after the missing persons, the failure, the neglect in that particular procedure, I was so disappointed by what she said.\\n'She said 'We have been advised in the report to apologise to the family' and I thought to myself if you need to be told by an organisation, because she knew it was true she had all the evidence.'\\nSTEPHEN PORT KILLINGS\\nScotland Yard was accused of 'institutional homophobia' for allegedly repeatedly dismissing fears that the murders of four young gay men by serial killer Stephen Port could be linked.\\nJohn Pape, who said he had a 'whirlwind friendship' with Slovakian Gabriel Kovari in summer 2014, said he provided the Metropolitan Police with information he thought might link the deaths in Barking, east London.\\nBy September of that year, depraved killer Port had murdered Anthony Walgate, Mr Kovari and Daniel Whitworth by plying them with fatal doses of the drug GHB and dumping their bodies near his home.\\n\\nAt the inquests into the deaths at Barking Town Hall, Mr Pape said he tracked down Mr Kovari's former boyfriend, Thierry Amodio, who was told by another man \u2014 later established to be Port, seeking to distance himself from the investigation \u2014 that the men were drugged at orgies involving older men.\\nBut Mr Pape said police seemed to ignore his attempts to provide them with information. It came as the detective appointed to speak with Mr Kovari's family admitted having never done so, saying she was 'busy'.\\nIn December, Dame Cressida apologised to the family of a victim of Port. She told Mr Walgate's mother: 'I am sorry, both personally and on behalf of The Met \u2014 had police listened to what you said, things would have turned out a lot differently.'\\nEURO 2020 WEMBLEY FIASCO\\nOn Dame Cressida's watch, ticketless football hooligans broke past Wembley's security barriers during the Euros 2020 last year and stormed the grounds ahead of England's clash with Italy.\\nThe Met was accused of not having enough officers on duty to create a 'ring of steel' around he venue to hold back the frenzied England supporters.\\nAt the time, Sadiq Khan said: 'It was not right what happened on Sunday \u2014 not just at Wembley, but across our city with the hooligans, from outside London, breaking the law in Leicester Square, Liverpool Street, Trafalgar Square, Wembley, and so forth.\\n'The FA are reviewing their arrangements at Wembley, the Met Police Service will take part in that review.\\n'The Met Police Service as we speak are sifting through the CCTV and body-worn videos. Already, 86 arrests have been made. I'd remind people that 19 police officers were injured. It's really important that those responsible for criminal behaviour are arrested, charged and prosecuted.\\n'What's also really important, that I say loudly and clearly: the police have my full confidence and full support. One of my jobs as the mayor is to provide scrutiny of the police service to help provide the checks and balances in a vibrant democracy.\\n'The police should be properly policed and often that there are difficult conversations between me as mayor and the senior team at the Met Police Service, but they have got my full support.'\\nLONDON BRIDGE & EXTINCTION REBELLION\\nIn 2017 Dame Cressida was criticised for her choice of words after she said the victims of the London Bridge terror attack demonstrated London's 'diversity'.\\nThe officer added: 'We believe, of course, that that's what makes our city so great. It's a place where the vast majority of time it's incredibly integrated and that diversity gives us strength.'\\nIn 2019 the Met under Dame Cressida's leadership was widely criticised for its 'light-touch' policing of Extinction Rebellion protests.The environmental demonstrators were allowed to blockade key areas of the capital for days, including Westminster Bridge and Oxford Circus.\\nSo who might take over the troubled Met? Favourites to replace Cressida Dick include an ex-counter-terror chief who threatened to jail journalists or a Merseyside cop who said violent criminals were 'NOT inherently bad people'\\nThe leadership of the Metropolitan Police was thrown into chaos last night after Dame Cressida Dick's bombshell resignation as Scotland Yard boss.\\nConfidence in the force has been shaken in recent years by a series of scandals including the murder of Sarah Everard by depraved cop Wayne Couzens, the disastrous probe into fake VIP child sex abuse claims, and allegations of racism, sexism and homophobia within the ranks.\\nDame Cressida Dick, who became the first woman to head the Met Police\u00a0in 2017, said she had 'no choice but to step aside' after losing Sadiq Khan's confidence.\\nFollowing the announcement, questions quickly turned to who would succeed her during a tumultuous time for Britain's biggest police force.\\nLikely replacements for the \u00a3230,000-a-year role range from a counter-terror chief who threatened to jail journalists and blamed terrorism on a lack of social mobility to a Merseyside cop who said violent criminals were 'not inherently bad people'.\\nSpeaking to MailOnline in September, a senior MP said they feared the current crop of senior police may be 'too woke'. 'The problem with Cressida is she has presided over a series of disasters, and then says it is not her fault,' the MP said. 'It is difficult when we always take the same view that operational decisions are a matter for the police not politicians.'\\nHere, MailOnline goes through the list of likely candidates to succeed Dame Cressida.\\nNeil Basu: Anti-terror chief who called for journalists to be prosecuted after publishing leaked cables criticising Trump\\nNeil Basu is the Met's former head of counter-terrorism and the most senior serving British officer of Asian heritage.\\nHe also served as the assistant commissioner for specialist operations until September 2021, which included responsibilities around national security, and had originally been tipped for the top job in 2017 before losing out to Dame Cressida.\\nIn February this year, he called for laws in the Equality Act 2010 that restrict positive discriminations to be relaxed in order to boost the number of BAME recruits. He was immediately shot down by policing minister Kit Malthouse, while Home Secretary Priti Patel was also said to be against the idea.\\nMr Basu faced fresh accusations of meddling in politics in July 2019, when he threatened to prosecute journalists for publishing leaked cables from Britain's ambassador to the US, Sir Kim Darroch.\\nFormer Tory cabinet minister David Davis said the intervention 'strayed well beyond his brief', and represented an attack on the free Press.\\nMr Basu's comments came after Scotland Yard launched a probe to find who leaked Sir Kim's memos calling the Trump administration 'clumsy and inept'.\\nMr Basu, who has spent his whole career at the Met, made another controversial intervention in August that year when suggested homegrown terrorism was fuelled by a lack of social mobility and inclusion. He said better education and opportunities for young people would do more to fight terrorism than 'the policing and state security apparatus put together' \u2014 adding that he was not trying to excuse any acts of violence.\\nHe also said British Muslims should not be forced to 'assimilate', adding: 'Assimilation implies that I have to hide myself in order to get on. We should not be a society that accepts that.'\\nA 2019 profile of Basu in the Mail On Sunday described him as well-liked within the force and by intelligence officials at MI5. But he has attracted criticism for some of his operational decisions, most notably as head of Operations Weeting, Elveden and Tuleta. The three inquiries into phone hacking, computer hacking and alleged payments to police officers by newspapers cost around \u00a319.5million and were criticised for criminalising journalists.\\nMr Basu also raised eyebrows when he criticised the Prevent programme \u2013 which tries to detect and deradicalise Muslim extremists \u2013 as 'toxic'.\\nA Hindu, born to an Indian doctor father and a white British mother, he has said he has encountered racism over most of his life. He grew up in Stafford, where he studied at Walton High School before reading economics at Nottingham University.\\nHe became a Met police officer in 1992, serving first as a beat bobby in Battersea, South London, then swiftly moving through the ranks as a borough commander in Barnet, North London, and a Commander of South London in 2012.\\nAndy Cooke: Former Merseyside chief who insists even violent criminals are 'not inherently bad people'\\nWhile head of Merseyside Police, Andy Cooke sparked anger when\u00a0he said even violent criminals are 'not inherently bad people' and he'd rather pump billions into cutting poverty than upholding the law.\\nThe officer, marking his retirement as Chief Constable of Merseyside Police, said if he was given a \u00a35 billion budget to cut crime, he would spend \u00a31 billion on crime and \u00a34 billion on tackling poverty.\\nHe now serves in the role of Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary and Inspector of Fire and Rescue Authorities in England. He will be overseeing inspections primarily in the North of England.\\nMr Cooke was chief constable for five years, during which time he has overseen the jailing of dozens of multi-millionaire drug laws, including Liverpool's most notorious drugs boss Liam 'the Lam' Cornett, who was transported to court in a huge armed convoy every day, and the jet-setting Mulhare brothers, who were caught abroad in Thailand after being informed on by a 'supergrass'.\\nMurderers jailed during his tenure include George Leather, 60, who brutally killed his Asda worker wife, 56, by stabbing her 300 times in an 'episode of unspeakable and barbaric savagery', and Robert Child, 37, who was jailed for life for striking his 64-year-old mother Janice with a hammer 31 times.\\nTory MP Andrew Bridgen said of Mr Cooke's plans for the police budget: 'In that case would he be quite happy to sack 80% of the officers. Reducing poverty is not a function of the policing budget, it's the job of other agencies and government.\\n'I'm not convinced that this change would be welcomed by the vast majority of the UK population. They want to see the police protecting citizens and property and crime. He sounds like someone who would have taken the knee for BLM and defunded the police.'\\nUnder Mr Cooke, Merseyside Police gained a reputation for tough policing and for being a keen user of stop-and-search powers. He was also the first commander of Merseyside's Matrix unit, set up to tackle gang crime and violence.\\n\\nSimon Byrne: Top Northern Ireland cop 'with a reputation for being like Darth Vader'\\nSimon Byrne became chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland in May 2019, arriving at the force with 36 years of policing behind him.\\nAfter holding senior roles at GMP and the Met, he became chief constable of Cheshire Police from 2014 to 2017. That role ended in controversial circumstances after he was accused of bullying and humiliating staff.\\nA misconduct hearing was told he had a reputation for being like Darth Vader and treated junior officers and staff like 'roadkill'.\\nThe hearing was told he handed pictures of Dad's Army characters to officers after he became angry when flooding made him late for work.\\nHowever, he was cleared of misconduct, with the tribunal concluding that much of what was claimed was either exaggerated or most likely didn't happen.\\nDuring his time as chief constable,\u00a0Mr Byrne revealed he had considered breaking the law in order to hire more officers from ethnic minorities. At that time the force only had three black officers.\\nHe told the BBC in 2017 that the law should be changed in England 'for a certain period of time' to allow the hiring of minority candidates to speed up. This would ensure that 'for every white officer, we recruit one black officer.'\\nMr Byrne said: 'I've even taken legal advice about breaking the law, which might sound crazy as a senior police officer.\\n'But if we're put under pressure to change, then what are the consequences, other than reputational, from breaking the law?'\\nUnder current equality rules employers cannot employ a job applicant because of characteristics like race, sexual orientation or gender, if other candidates are better qualified.\\nAt PSNI he attracted controversy for\u00a0suggesting the children of paramilitaries could be taken into care.\\nHe was also forced to apologise\u00a0after tweeting a photo of himself with officers holding rifles outside a PSNI station on Christmas Day, the BBC reported.\\nMartin Hewitt: NPCC chief who backed crackdown on Covid sceptics and said officers felt 'undervalued' amid pay row\\nAs chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) throughout the Covid crisis, Martin Hewitt has made a number of high-profile interventions in politics.\\nAmid fury last year at officers being hit by a pay freeze, Mr Hewitt told Priti\u00a0Patel that many officers believed the decision was 'unfair' and they felt 'undervalued' after their efforts during Covid.\\nMr Hewitt said: 'For many it feels unfair and that their contribution is undervalued.\\n'And, unlike other parts of the public service, officers do not have the option of industrial action to make their case more strongly.\\n'As the Government makes spending decisions over coming months, we urge you to fund a settlement which properly reflects the important and complex work police officers do, and starts to address the pay shortfall.'\\nIn January 2021, he backed a crackdown on lockdown sceptics and said officers\u00a0would no longer 'waste time' trying to reason with them amid soaring death rates.\\nSpeaking at a Downing Street press briefing, he gave examples of shocking 'irresponsible behaviour' from people not heeding warnings - even with more than 1,200 people dying every day.\\nThey included a \u00a330-per-head boat party in Hertfordshire with more than 40 people, a Surrey house party whose host tried to claim it was a business event and a minibus full of people from different households caught travelling from Cheltenham into Wales for a walk.\\nMr Hewitt was appointed in April 2019. He began his policing career with Kent Police in 1993 and transferred to the Metropolitan Police Service in 2005.\\nAs an Assistant Commissioner for five years, he led frontline and local policing, specialist crime and professional standards.\\nHe led the national police response to adult sexual offences and kidnap between 2014 and 2019, and served as a Vice-Chair for the NPCC from 2015 before taking on the chairmanship.\\nMatt Jukes: Assistant commissioner credited with leading crackdown on Rotherham child grooming gangs\\nMatt Jukes joined South Yorkshire police in 1995 three years after graduating with a degree in mathematics from Oxford.\\nHe worked as a detective and rose through the ranks to represent UK police forces at G8 meetings and lead on national anti-terror strategy.\\nMr Jukes is best known for tackling Rotherham grooming gangs while borough commander\u00a0in the Yorkshire town from 2006 to 2010.\\nMore than 1,000 children were exploited in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013, with local authorities, schools and police among agencies that failed to tackle the problem.\\nA report on the scandal by Professor Alexis Jay suggested that Mr Jukes' leadership marked a point where police became more proactive in dealing with the abuse.\\nAfter serving in South Yorkshire Police, he moved to South Wales, with the police and crime commissioner there Alun Michael backing him as an outstanding leader.\\nMr Jukes worked his way up to the top post in South Wales Police, becoming Chief Constable in January 2018.\\nHe is also chairman of Police Sport UK.\\nMr Jukes moved to the Met in\u00a0November 2020. He was awarded a Queens Police Medal in the New Year Honours List 2018.", "image": [["Jean Charles De Menezes", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/11/06/40688278-10499677-Jean_Charles_De_Menezes-a-7_1644562361570.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/09/13/53722675-10493141-image-a-7_1644411778511.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/09/09/53722671-10493141-image-a-17_1644399739870.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/10/19/53722661-10499677-image-a-19_1644520968949.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/09/13/53722657-10493141-image-a-8_1644411778512.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/11/02/53722653-10499677-image-a-39_1644545314195.jpg"], ["Beleaguered Dame Cressida Dick has finally resigned as Metropolitan Police Commissioner after presiding over a litany of controversies as Scotland Yard chief", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/10/19/54031465-10499677-image-m-8_1644520515861.jpg"], ["The under-fire public figure had earlier insisted she had \u2018no intention of going\u2019, striking a defiant tone following London Mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s decision to put her \u2018on notice\u2019 with just \u2018days and weeks\u2019 to enact major changes", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/11/19/54031561-10499677-The_under_fire_public_figure_had_earlier_insisted_she_had_no_int-a-14_1644606540750.jpg"], ["Dame Cressida was also slammed by the families of victims of VIP paedophile ring fantasist Carl Beech, whose spurious allegations were investigated by police - ruining the lives and reputations of those he accused", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/11/00/45416125-10499677-Dame_Cressida_was_also_slammed_by_the_families_of_victims_of_VIP-a-73_1644539163836.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/10/20/54033129-10499677-image-m-40_1644523529332.jpg"], ["The news comes a week after Mr Khan said he was \u2018not satisfied\u2019 with the Met's Commissioner\u2019s response to calls for change following a series of scandals including the murder of Sarah Everard by serving officer Wayne Couzens", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/10/19/54031565-10499677-The_news_comes_a_week_after_Mr_Khan_said_he_was_not_satisfied_wi-a-35_1644522167455.jpg"], ["This is a MailOnline mock-up of WhatsApp conversations that were published in the IOPC report.

At least some of the wrongdoers served in a specialist vice squad.\\nThe highly critical report is\u00a0just the latest scandal under Dame Cressida's watch - who is currently facing criticism over her handling of the No10 Partygate scandal - and today led to a chorus of calls for her to resign or be sacked.\\nFormer chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal said: 'The Met Police may be the worst for institutional misogyny and racism but they're not the only ones.\u00a0Only a statutory judge led inquiry will do. Only new leadership will do.'\\nMeanwhile, Labour MP Diane Abbott said Dame Cressida was 'clearly not fit to lead the fundamental reform needed'.\\nInstitutional failings at the force were\u00a0placed under intense scrutiny by the murder of Sarah Everard by serving Met officer Wayne Couzens - who was allegedly nicknamed 'the rapist' by colleagues during his earlier career as an armed guard for the Civil Nuclear Constabulary.\\nCommenting on the watchdog's findings, Priti Patel said:\u00a0'It has been clear for some time that there are problems with the culture of the Metropolitan Police, which is why last year I tasked the Angiolini Inquiry and the police inspectorate with investigating these deeply concerning issues.\\n'I expect the Metropolitan Police and the Mayor of London to implement the recommendations of this report as soon as practically possible. The public rightly expects the behaviour of the police to be beyond reproach - standards must be raised.'\\nThe report also exposed numerous instances of homophobic language, with officers talking about 'f****** gays' and writing 'f*** you bender', in addition to a mass of\u00a0racist comments including references to African children, Somali people and Auschwitz.\\nToday Jamie Klingler, of campaign group Reclaim These Streets, called Dame Cressida 'delusional' for recently claiming the Met did not have a problem with institutional homophobia.\\nThe messages were uncovered as part of nine linked investigations into officers based in Westminster, mostly at Charing Cross police station, which began in March 2018 after allegations that a male officer had sex with a drunk woman at a police station.\\nToday, the Met today said it was 'deeply sorry' for the 'reprehensible behaviour' displayed by its officers and said it had taken 'a series of measures to hold those responsible to account and stamp out unacceptable behaviour'.\\nBut\u00a0Dame Diana Johnson, the Labour chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, accused the force of not doing enough to root out racists and misogynists.\\n\\nCressida Dick's reign as Metropolitan Police commissioner has been overshadowed by controversy over bungled operations and investigations:\\nApril 2017: Appointed as first female Metropolitan Police commissioner with a brief to modernise the force and keep it out of the headlines.\\nApril 2019: Extinction Rebellion protesters bring London to a standstill over several days with the Met powerless to prevent the chaos.

While these officers predominantly worked in teams in Westminster, which have since been disbanded, we know from other recent cases that these issues are not isolated or historic.\\n'The learning report we are publishing today is shocking and contains language which is offensive - and some may find it upsetting. However, we felt it was important to provide the context for the public, the Met and other forces, for why such hard-hitting recommendations are necessary.'\\nWhile the IOPC acknowledged the work that the Met has done since to improve, Mr Naseem said more needs to be done.\\nHe said: 'Our investigation showed the officers' use of 'banter' became a cover for bullying and harassment. Colleagues were afraid to speak out about these behaviours for fear of being ostracised, demeaned or told to get another job.\\n'We are grateful to those officers who were brave enough to speak to us about the cultural issues that existed within these teams, realising that in doing so they risked further bullying. This took courage. Hopefully our learning report and recommendations will give officers the confidence to come forward in the knowledge that people are listening and that changes will be made.\\n'The relationship between the police and the public is critical to maintaining the principle of policing by consent. The concerns about behaviour and culture addressed in our report, if allowed to continue and go unchallenged, risked causing serious damage to that relationship.'\\nOf the 14 officers investigated, two were fired for gross misconduct and put on a barred list to stop them ever working again for the police. Two officers resigned and two others were disciplined.\\nDeputy assistant commissioner Bas Javid said: 'I am angry and disappointed to see officers involved in sharing sexist, racist and discriminatory messages. It's clear we have a lot of work to do to ensure bullying and discrimination does not exist in any part of the Met.\\n'The actions of these officers between 2016 and 2018 were unacceptable, unprofessional, disrespectful and deeply offensive. I read their messages with increasing disgust and shame.\\n'We haven't waited for the IOPC's report to take action - a number of officers have been subject to misconduct proceedings, including one officer dismissed and one who would have been dismissed had he not already resigned. Every Met employee has also been spoken to about responsible use of social media.\\n'We recognise that there is need for real change in the Met and we are committed to creating an environment that is even more intolerant to those who do not uphold the high values and standards expected of us.'\\nA review of culture and standards in the Met is currently being carried out by Baroness Casey, in the wake of the murder of Sarah Everard by a serving police officer.\\nMayor of London Sadiq Khan said: 'I am utterly disgusted by the behaviour outlined in this IOPC report, which details the shocking evidence of discrimination, misogyny, harassment and bullying by police officers.\\n'The conduct of these officers was totally unacceptable and what has been revealed by these investigations will only further damage public trust and confidence in the police.\\n'It is right that the team concerned has been disbanded and the police officers found to be involved have been dismissed, disciplined or have left the police.\\n'Anyone found to be responsible for sexism, racism, misogyny, Islamophobia, antisemitism, bullying or harassment does not deserve to wear the Met uniform and must be rooted out.'\\nWith Cressida Dick facing fresh questions over the culture at the Met, here are just some of the horrific comments\u00a0 exposed in the report:\\nOn rape and sexual abuse\\nOne officer's aggressive behaviour towards women was considered so suspect that he was known as 'Mcrapey Raperson'.\\nThe nickname is similar to that of PC Wayne Couzens, the police officer who used his position to abduct, rape and murder Sarah Everard.\\nAsked why someone at Charing Cross Police Station was called 'Mcrapey Raperson', a colleague said it related to 'harassing them [women], getting on them, do you know what I mean being like, just a d***.\\nWhatsApp conversation between two police officers:\\no Officer 1: 'And my bird won't stop taking the p***.

It can be done with a bit of effort using a credit card, but it's quicker and easier just to use a knife.'\\nPolice officers who gave evidence spoke of dominant macho officers, bragging about sexual activity, encouraging each other to 'slap women' or even 'grab her p***y'.\\nFor example, there was an officer described as 'a bit of a ladies man, who would chase and harass women', and that 'there was a 'be careful when he's around' kind of atmosphere.'\\nWhatsApp groups were dominated by chat including domestic violence, plus sexually explicit, misogynistic and demeaning conversations about women, including partners.\\nIn one conversation 'Officer 1' said: 'And my bird won't stop taking the p**s. Swear to got [sic] I'm going to smack her'. A policeman known as\u00a0Officer 2 said: 'Slap her one\u2026say you didn't'\\nOfficer 1 then replied 'I`ll f***ing do it. She`s f***ed off home.'\\nIn a later conversation\u00a0\u00a0Officer 1 said: 'I f***ing need to take my bird out, won't see her until next Saturday. Then I have to work.

Knock a bird about and she will love you. Human nature. They are biologically programmed to like that s**t.'\\nOfficer 2 said: 'Lmao' and his colleague replied:\u00a0'I'm right though'.\\nRacism and homophobia\\nThe Met officers joked about black people being robbers, Africans being 'made into dog food', Somalian 'rats' and even the Holocaust.\\nOne police officer described one patrol as having 'walked past the big mosque [as] all the fanatics turn up at to radicalise the young'.\\nMany of the messages were sent at the time when the Black Lives Matter movement came to prominence around the globe in 2020.\\nIn one WhatsApp group an policeman said:\u00a0 'My dad kidnapped some African children and used them to make dog food'.\\nAnother wrote: 'Some uniform or plain clothes work on Somalian rats\u2026 I battered one the other day\u2026weighed less than [police officer's name]'.\\nA police officer sent another officer an image of a Black man wearing a white shirt. His\u00a0colleague asked, 'What's good about it I don't get it lol.'
