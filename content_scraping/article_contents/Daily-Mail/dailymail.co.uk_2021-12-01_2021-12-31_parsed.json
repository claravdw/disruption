Up to six activists gather at nighttime to build structures used in demonstrations, according to neighbour.

The boat, covered in grey tarpaulin, sits alongside two large yellow skips, a portaloo and a red Toyota Yaris.", "text": "Extinction Rebellion activists are believed to be holding secret nighttime meetings in a public car park just outside Cambridge where they are also storing their bright pink boat used as the centrepiece of their hated protests, MailOnline can reveal today.\\nMembers of the climate group are said to gather with car headlights on and speak with 'hushed tones'\u00a0as they plan their demonstrations and have been seen putting together their scaffolding-type structures\u00a0used to cause traffic chaos in London and outside businesses they don't like.\\nThe car park is just down the road from one of XR's most active local protestors, Nick Skelton, who also goes by DJ Skunk on a radio show that he runs. He told MailOnline he knew nothing about the quarterly meet-ups 50 yards from his terraced house.\\nA neighbour claims up to six activists gather when darkness falls to practice erecting the tipi-like wooden structures that are used to block roads during protests.\\nThe man, who asked not to be named, told MailOnline: 'They gather in the dark with the car headlights on like some kind of secret meeting. They\u2019re tucked up in the corner and trying to not draw too much attention to themselves. It\u2019s a fairly quiet place, you wouldn\u2019t notice them as you were driving by.'\\nIt is believed that the group may have used the car park to prepare for a recent Black Friday protest at Amazon distribution centres.\\nThe XR activists also hide their famous pink boat at the far end of the car park, which is around the size of a five-a-side football pitch. Covered by grey tarpaulin, the boat - around two metres high and five metres long - was used to block a road in a recent protest at the Schlumberger Gould research centre in Cambridge.\\nLocals said it has been there for more than a year and XR members have been seen gathering there at least three times in 2021, but activist Mr Skelton said it is nothing to do with him.\u00a0\u00a0A neighbour said that the boat had been in the car park since March 2020.\\nNick said: 'I can\u2019t be implicated in anything. Anything that\u2019s written down is incriminating or could be incriminating, and as you know it [the boat] is used for protests.\\n'The boat just arrived there one day. I know it\u2019s there but it\u2019s not mine. It just lives down there. Someone comes and takes it away and it reappears again. I don\u2019t move it and I don\u2019t have access to the trailer or anything.'\\nNick, 68, denied taking part in the secret meetings of XR activists as he spoke on the doorstep of his semi-detached house, which has a large fabric banner in the front garden reading \u2018A better world is possible\u2019.\\nNick, who was last year charged with conspiracy to cause criminal damage in relation to an XR protest before the charge was dropped, said: 'I\u2019m not involved in that. I\u2019m disabled so all I can do is hold a flag or write a letter to an MP.'\\nHe confirmed that the pink boat belongs to XR and was used in the Schlumberger protest but denied any personal ownership over it.\\nThe boat sits alongside two large yellow skips, a portaloo and a red Toyota Yaris that apparently belongs to Nick.\\nTwo pots of paint and several planks of four-metre-long wood are stored beneath the boat.\\nA neighbour said that he had seen XR protestors gathering in the car park on three occasions in the last year, including ahead of the recent Black Friday protests at Amazon distribution centres.\\nHe said: 'They meet to set up their tipis. They do practice runs at night before going out. It\u2019s always in the evening with three to six people.'\\nExtinction Rebellion has previously described itself as an international 'non-violent civil disobedience' movement and has staged countless demonstrations that have caused major disruption across the UK.\\nSince April 2019, the campaign group has targeted popular and busy areas of Britain, including central London, as well as disrupting commuters on the roads and gluing themselves to trains.\\nIn October 2019, XR launched a two-week series of actions they called 'International Rebellion' which took place in 60 cities worldwide.\\nIn London, this included protests which saw several thousand people shut down parts of Westminster, blocking Whitehall, the Mall, Westminster Bridge, Lambeth Bridge, Trafalgar Square, Downing Street and Victoria Embankment.\\nThey also used a fire engine to spray fake blood onto and around the Treasury.\\nMost recently, 44 activists were arrested at the recent demonstrations outside Amazon distribution centres.\\nThe group claimed protests took place\u00a0at sites in Doncaster, Darlington, Newcastle, Manchester, Peterborough, Derby, Coventry, Rugeley, Dartford, Bristol, Tilbury, Milton Keynes and Dunfermline.\\nActivists arrived in the early hours of Friday to set up bamboo structures and 'lock-ons', and held banners urging Amazon to cut its emissions.\\nLast month,\u00a0Extinction Rebellion pledged to mobilise two million protestors to launch what it says will be 'the largest act of civil resistance in UK history' in April next year.\\nIt made the pledge after criticising November's COP26 climate summit, claiming it did not go far enough to tackle the crisis.\\nThe group said that the number of activists taking part in their demonstrations had dwindled during the pandemic but that they hoped to rely on record numbers in 2022.\\nThe famous pink boat has featured in many Extinction Rebellion protests and was used to help blockade a busy Oxford Street junction in London back in April 2019.\\nA number of Extinction Rebellion supporters, including British Olympians Laura Baldwin and Etienne Stott, also chained themselves to the boat after gaining access to ExxonMobil's Fawley oil terminal at the edge of the New Forest in Hampshire in October.", "image": [["The unassuming public car park, on the outskirts of Cambridge, where Extinction Rebellion
