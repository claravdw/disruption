We were very conscious about that. We've been responsible and went to great lengths to research the environmental impact \u2013 it's not like I just purchased the cheapest option.\\n'It definitely seemed like the group are using a blunt tool to tackle what is actually a complex problem.'\\nMr Lowe, who runs a family-owned gin distillery and owns a Land Rover e-SUV, said he agrees that environmental challenges need tackling but that this is the wrong way to go about it.\\nHe added: 'I'm obviously sympathetic to their cause. The environmental situation is dire and needs answering but it's a complex and nuanced situation that minor acts of vandalism show no signs of improving.\\n'This is an important cause but they seem aligned with Extinction Rebellion who are uniquely placed to rally people against the cause they're trying to unite people behind.'\\nOne woman affected posted a photograph of her electric Mercedes-Benz EQC on Twitter as she urged the group to 'think before you act'.\\nShe wrote: 'You let down my tyres and I didn't notice until I started driving with my three children in my car. My car is fully electric.\\n'We also had a child that required to be at the hospital for an appointment in the city. Thankfully we had a second car.'\\nSUVs feature elements of standard cars but are larger and have off-road capabilities such as high ground clearance.\\nPetrol and diesel-powered models are generally less fuel efficient than cars.\\nLast year, one of the UK's most popular selling cars was a Kia Sportage SUV, according to Auto Express.\\nLegal experts say that although prosecution is unlikely, the activists could actually be committing a criminal offence.\\nLaura Baumanis, a criminal defence solicitor at legal defence firm Olliers, told MailOnline: 'Whilst it is extremely rare for someone to be prosecuted for letting the air out of a tyre, technically, it could be classed as criminal damage.\\n'For this offence to be satisfied, any damage caused does not have to be permanent, but is made out by virtue of the fact that steps need to be taken, ordinarily at expense to the owner, for the item to be in a working condition again.'\\nMeanwhile,\u00a0Matthew Nash, tutor at The University of Law, said if the driver failed to notice the flat tyre and drove away, more serious charges could be brought it they crashed.\\nHe said: 'Letting out air from someone's tyres is clear criminal damage.\\n'Although technically the tyre is not 'damaged', if you do something to someone else's property and they need to do something to restore it, that is Criminal Damage within the meaning of the Criminal Damage Act.\\n'It is possible that if they let the air out of someone's types so as to cause an accident, there could be more serious charges depending on the resulting damage or injury.\\n'It is also possible that there could be other offences if this were done to many cars at the same time.'\\nThree police forces have confirmed they are investigating multiple reports of criminal damage in Brighton, Liverpool and Cambridge.\\nSUVs emit 25 per cent more\u00a0carbon dioxide on average than a medium-sized car, and have jumped in popularity in the UK from nearly seven per cent of private cars sold in the UK in 2009 to more than 21 per cent in 2018, according to the UK energy Research Centre.\\nThe New Scientist reported how global analysis found the rise of SUVs last year wiped out the environmental gains from electric cars.\\nThe eco fanatics are actively encouraging people to join their cause and are directing people to websites which demonstrate how to deflate someone's tyres.\\nMarion Walker from The Tyre Extinguishers said: 'Governments and politicians have failed to protect us from these massive unnecessary vehicles.\\n'SUVs are a climate disaster, they cause air pollution and are dangerous for other road users. Everyone hates them, apart from the people who drive them.\\n'Politely asking for climate action, clean air and safer streets has failed. It's time for action.\\n'We have no leader \u2013 anyone can take part, wherever you are. Join us.'\\nThe leaflets left on vehicles make little mention of those who have chosen to drive electric vehicles bar one line at the end which reads: 'Driving a hybrid or electric? These are still polluting, dangerous and cause congestion.'\\nA hybrid SUV owner who was targeted last night says his day was upended as he was meant to be moving house this morning.\\nNeil Longuet-Higgins, from Brighton, told MailOnline: 'I got in my car and drove about 10 yards down the road when I noticed a leaflet on the windscreen and thought I must have got a parking ticket.\\n'At that point, there were warning lights about the flat as well and I realised what had happened so I drove gingerly about 200 yards so I could park up and thought well I can't wait around because I'm meant to be meeting movers at 8am.'\\nMr Longuet-Higgins says he was forced to drive carefully to the nearest garage but after trying two, was unsuccessful due to faulty pumps and so was forced to call out AA.\\nHe says the ordeal set him and his movers back about two hours and left him out of pocket.\\nHe added: 'Because I had driven on it, I damaged the tyre so it's going to cost me \u00a3250 to get it replaced.\\n'It's just a waste of everyone's time. I had a diesel before and got rid of it because of the harm to the environment.\\n'I use the 4x4 on all terrains so its not like it's a Chelsea tractor \u2013 it's ideal for what I use it for so I don't see why I should be punished.\\n'I think they will end up alienating most people \u2013 it disrupts ordinary people's lives.'\\nChris Genner, from Brighton, also drives an electric SUV and wrote a complaint to the Tyre Extinguishers. He told MailOnline he intends to review CCTV and hand any evidence over to the police.\\nHe added: 'I was surprised but more so disappointed as whilst my vehicle may look like an SUV, it is an electric version which I purposely chose - and paid more for - for its environmental benefits.'\\nPictures shared by the group show that they left leaflets on the vehicles they targeted which told drivers to use public transport.\\nThe leaflet reads: 'Attention - your gas guzzler kills.\u00a0You'll be angry, but don't take it personally. It's not you, it's the car.\\n'We did this because driving around urban areas in your massive vehicle has huge consequences for others.'\\nCalling SUVs 'pure vanity', it tells the driver they will 'have no difficulty getting around without your gas guzzler, with walking, cycling or public transport.'\\nThe Tyre Extinguishers claim air pollution is racist because people of colour live in areas more likely to be exposed to toxic air and 'SUV drivers tend to be richer and therefore tend to be white'.\\nThe group cite the International Energy Agency's findings in 2019 which reported that SUVs are the second largest cause of the global rise in carbon dioxide emissions over the past decade.\\nThey also claim SUVs are more dangerous because they are more likely to kill a pedestrian and cite unknown psychological studies which found SUV drivers take more risks, 'putting other road users and pedestrians in danger'.\\nIn a statement shared this morning, it adds: 'SUVs exist purely for the vanity of their owners, who see them as a status symbol.\\n'For the sake of this vanity and conspicuous consumption, climate change is made worse, we breathe in polluted air, and more people die in accidents. This is unacceptable.'\\nCalling on a ban on SUVs in urban areas, pollution levies to tax SUVs 'out of existence' and 'massive investment in free, comprehensive public transport', the eco mob say they will continue until politicians take action.\\nThe respective police forces have been contacted for comment.\\nA spokesperson for the Met said: 'We are aware of a statement by Tyre Extinguisher alleging damage to vehicles at various locations in London by them.\\n'We ask that reports of this nature are made through the Met's website and we will assess these to establish whether offences have been committed.\\n'At this time, we are not aware of any investigations being launched.'\\nCambridgeshire Constabulary is treating three reports of air being let out of tyres as suspected criminal damage.\\nA spokesman said: 'We have received three reports of flat tyres in the Cambridge area. Crimes have been raised for criminal damage and an investigation is ongoing.'\\nAvon and Somerset Police couldn't find any relevant incidents in Bristol.\\nIren Brown and her husband Nick woke up to find all four tyres on the family's part-electric Toyota Rav 4 had been deflated by activists.\\nMr Brown, 64, from Brighton, had to cancel a hospital appointment.\\nMrs Brown, 43, said: 'The Toyota is a hybrid electric car which we bought because we were being mindful of the environmental impact our previous diesel car was having.\\n'But these activists have not taken that into consideration.\\n'I'm so angry because everyone is behind their cause but their tactics are indiscriminate and scattershot.'\\nThe mother-of-two, a kitchen designer, added: 'Nick is quite a serious diabetic and we may have need to access a vehicle in an emergency.\\n'Their actions could have been dangerous.'\\nSussex Police is appealing for CCTV footage which could help their investigation after multiple drivers reported their cars had been targeted by The Tyre Extinguishers.\\nCars parked in five roads near a school in Green Party constituency Brighton were hit by the eco warriors during the early of hours.\\nA spokesman for the force said: 'On Tuesday morning (March 8) police received multiple reports from the Brighton area from members of the public who found the tyres on their cars had been deflated.\\n'It's thought the vehicles in Balfour Road, The Drive, Lowther Road, Maldon Road and Newells Close were targeted during the early hours of the morning.\\n'Enquiries are ongoing, and anyone with information or who has video footage from the area which could help officers with their investigation is asked to report it to police online or call 101 quoting serial number 111 of 08/03.'\\nMerseyside Police is launching high visibility patrols in the Liverpool suburb of Allerton after a number of cars were targeted by The Tyre Extinguishers.\\nA force spokesman said: 'We are appealing for information after tyres on a number of cars were reported to have been let down in Allerton overnight.\\n'We received a number of reports on Tuesday morning (March 8) reporting members of the public finding their tyres had been deflated on streets off Allerton Road and Rose Lane.\\n'It is believed the vehicles on streets including Courtland Road, Edale Road, Addingham Road and Hillside Road were targeted in the early hours of the morning.\\n'Enquiries are ongoing, and high visibility patrols will be deployed in the area affected.'\\nWere you targeted by Tyre Extinguishers?

A large family car will now cost more than \u00a3100 to fill up and a gas-guzzling 4x4 Land Rover north of \u00a3165 per tank.\\nBut in a slight glimmer of hope, the price of a barrel of oil has fallen to around $111-a-barrel today, down from $117 yesterday, $127 on Tuesday and a spike of $140 on Monday. But that's unlikely to filter back down to drivers just yet.\\nSaudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman is said to have snubbed a request from Joe Biden to have a call on the issue of oil supply, as the West tries to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels.\\nBut the Prime Minister is believed to have a better relationship with the crown prince than the US President, whose links have been strained since the killing of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The PM and crown prince discussed 'energy cooperation' only last month. Tory MPs suggested Mr Johnson could use his relationship with the Saudis to convince them to release more oil.\\nAndrew Murrison, who served as Mr Johnson's Middle East minister until February 2020, told The Daily Telegraph: 'The energy crunch means that jurisdictions are going to have to look further afield for continuity of supply... The UK has always maintained a positive and constructive relationship with Saudi Arabia based on dialogue.'\\nThe price of oil dropped from 14-year highs earlier this week following suggestions from the International Energy Agency (IEA) that members will release 60 million barrels from stockpiles, mainly from the US, western Europe and Asia. The United Arab Emirates is also ready to encourage fellow Opec members to increase oil production as the West bans Russian imports, which is further pushing down prices, albeit still to a still exceptionally high level.\\nReaders of Mail Newspapers and MailOnline have always shown immense generosity at times of crisis.\\nCalling upon that human spirit, we are supporting a huge push to raise money for refugees from Ukraine.\\nFor, surely, no one can fail to be moved by the heartbreaking images and stories of families \u2013 mostly women, children, the infirm and elderly \u2013 fleeing from the bombs and guns.\\nAs this tally of misery increases over the coming days and months, these innocent victims of this conflict will require accommodation, schools and medical support.\\nDonations to the Mail Force Ukraine Appeal will be used to help charities and aid organisations providing such essential services.\\nIn the name of charity and compassion, we urge all our readers to give swiftly and generously.\\n\\nTO MAKE A DONATION ONLINE\\nDonate at www.mailforcecharity.co.uk/donate\\nTo add Gift Aid to a donation \u2013 even one already made \u2013 complete an online form found here: mymail.co.uk/ukraine\\nVia bank transfer, please use these details:\\nAccount name:\u00a0Mail Force Charity\\nAccount number:\u00a048867365\\nSort code:\u00a060-00-01\\nTO MAKE A DONATION VIA CHEQUE\\nMake your cheque payable to 'Mail Force' and post it to: Mail Newspapers Ukraine Appeal, GFM, 42 Phoenix Court, Hawkins Road, Colchester, Essex CO2 8JY\\nTO MAKE A DONATION FROM THE US\\nUS readers can donate to the appeal via a bank transfer to Associated Newspapers or by sending checks to dailymail.com HQ at 51 Astor Place (9th floor), New York, NY 10003\\nFigures from data firm Experian Catalist show UK forecourts sold the fuel at an average price of 159.6p per litre on Wednesday, up 3.2p since Monday.\\nThe average cost of a litre of diesel was 167.4p on Wednesday, following an increase of 5.1p from the start of the week.\\nOil prices soared following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, leading to higher wholesale costs for fuel retailers.\\nThe price per barrel of Brent crude - the most commonly used way of measuring the UK's oil price - reached 139 US dollars on Monday, which was its highest level in 14 years. But the price plummeted to 109 US dollars on Wednesday. It has risen again slightly today.\\nRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: 'A tank of petrol is now almost \u00a388 while diesel has now gone over \u00a392.\\n'Diesel unfortunately appears to be on a clear path to \u00a31.70 a litre.\\n'As this is an average price, drivers will be seeing some unbelievably high prices on forecourts as retailers pass on their increased wholesale costs.\\n'But there was a hint of better news yesterday on the wholesale market with substantial drops in both petrol and diesel which could lead, in a week or so, to a slight slowing in the daily pump price increases, and records being broken less frequently.'\\nIf unleaded reaches 184p per litre on average, that will see the typical price of filling up reach \u00a3101. Tory MP Karl McCartney said the Chancellor should take 'action to cut fuel duty or VAT until prices fall'.\\nAnd motorists could face even more misery in the coming weeks \u2013 as eco-protest group Extinction Rebellion said it plans to block major UK oil refineries next month as part of its campaign to force the Government to stop using fossil fuels.\\nAn economic shock worse than the 1973 oil crisis is looming for the UK amid fears prices could hit $240 a barrel this summer, MPs said last night.\\nThe warning came as energy prices around the world are soaring, with the ban on oil imports from Russia set to pile more pressure on already struggling British households.\\nRocketing inflation\u00a0\u2013 currently 5.5 per cent \u2013 could leave the average family \u00a31,750-a-year worse off, according to think-tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Some fear inflation could hit 8 per cent within months.\\nAs fuel prices rose at a rate of 5p per day - and at one Reading service station, in one hour - former Communities and Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick, 40, admitted that this crisis coupled with the cost of heating a home and rising food prices,\\nTory MP Steve Baker, of the Conservative Net Zero Scrutiny Group, told the Daily Mail: 'I'm afraid I fear an economic crisis worse than the 1970s, but I don't wish to be too alarmist because what actually happens will depend on the policy response.'\\nHe said: 'I fear that we still have the biggest bond market bubble in history, that we had inflation coming anyway, and this crisis will feed the inflation that's coming. That will force the Bank of England's hand on interest rates.'\\nThe fracking ban could be lifted if it can be done in a safe and sustainable way, the Business Secretary said yesterday.\\nIn what appeared to be the first sign of a U-turn, Kwasi Kwarteng confirmed the Government was 'open' to looking again at extracting shale gas as concerns grow over soaring energy prices.\\nDowning Street declined to deny talk of a rethink and said Boris Johnson was considering 'all options' to reduce reliance on Russian oil and gas.\\nFracking is a process in which liquid is pumped at high pressure underground to fracture shale rock and release gas or oil.\\nA moratorium was placed on the industry after it caused minor earthquakes in Lancashire in 2011 and 2019.\\nLiberal Democrat leader and former Energy Secretary Sir Ed Davey said: 'We could be facing the biggest economic shock since the 1973 oil crisis yet the Government's answer is to clobber people with an unfair tax rise.'\\nReferring to plans to raise national insurance, he stressed: 'It's time to spike the hike and offer families some much-needed respite.\\n'The last thing our economy or the British people need right now is for incomes to be squeezed further.'\\nThe 1973 crisis was triggered when Arab countries acted to quadruple the price of oil and imposed an embargo in protest at the West's support for Israel during the Yom Kippur War.\\nIn the ensuing chaos, UK inflation reached nearly 23 per cent in 1975.\\nThe price of a barrel of Brent crude oil hit 130 dollars this week after the US and UK announced bans on imports from Russia.\\nThat is 75 per cent higher than three months ago \u2013 and nearly three times where it was two years ago.\\nBut there are fears the price could surge to $240 by summer if Western countries continue to sanction Russian oil exports.\\nDavid Cameron last night urged the Government to slash taxes to help families weather the cost of living crisis.\\nThe former prime minister warned that Britons face a 'huge squeeze' on living standards with rocketing bills set to make 2022 a 'very tough year'. Mr Cameron \u2013who led an austerity drive during his own time in Downing Street \u2013 told Andrew Marr on LBC yesterday: 'If you can keep the cost of government down, and people's taxes down, you help them through the cost of living crisis.'\\n\\nIndustry consultant Rystad Energy told the Bloomberg news network that wider sanctions on Russian oil would create a 4.3million barrel a day hole that 'cannot simply be replaced by other sources of supply'.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Government was yesterday warned that the cost of supporting households with gas and electricity bills could soar by more than \u00a312billion.\\nChancellor Rishi Sunak last month promised to give families a discount on bills.\\nBut since war broke out in Ukraine the cost of oil and gas has shot up even more.\\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies said to give households the same degree of protection as Mr Sunak originally intended, the Government will need to find more than \u00a312billion on top of the original \u00a39billion it had planned to hand out.\\nThis will take the total cost of the package above \u00a321billion.\\nMr Sunak, who makes his Spring Statement on March 23, had also planned to give workers in the public sector, such as teachers and nurses, a long-awaited pay rise.\\nBut experts say if he wants their wages to increase in real terms at the rate he intended he will need to give them an extra \u00a31,750 each \u2013 or \u00a310billion in total.\\nBut in a slight glimmer of hope, the price of a barrel of oil fell 5 per cent to $117 this afternoon, having spiked at $140 on Monday and settling at around $127 yesterday.\\nIt dropped from 14-year highs earlier this week following suggestions from the International Energy Agency (IEA) that members will release 60 million barrels from stockpiles, mainly from the US, western Europe and\u00a0Asia.\\nOne petrol station in Chelsea is charging 219p-a-litre for diesel - a wallet-hammering \u00a310-per-gallon - and more than 218.9p\u00a0for unleaded. Prices of more than 190p are being seen outside the capital with queues forming at cheaper forecourts to beat the daily price hikes - not because of any shortages.\\nOne Welsh filling station, the\u00a0Moto Services at junction 47 of the M4 near Swansea,\u00a0is already charging 192.9p for diesel as prices continue to soar. Pictures also showed 199.9p for diesel outside Norwich, 189.9p on the A23 near Brighton and 185.9p in Grays, Essex.\\nRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: 'The cost of filling a 55-litre family car with petrol is now \u00a387 - \u00a37 more than it was at the start of the year. Diesel drivers are even worse off with a tank now costing more than \u00a390 for the first time ever \u2014 \u00a38 more than in early January'.\\nFormer Communities and Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick, 40, has admitted it could be 'the most difficult economic year we've seen in my lifetime'.\\nMailOnline yesterday tracked seven ships carrying Russian oil, gas and diesel all turned away from the UK in the past week including several trying to use a loophole meaning they weren't technically covered by sanctions.\\nPressure was growing for Rishi Sunak to cut petrol taxes last night amid warnings the average cost of filling up a family car will surge past \u00a3100 within days.\\nTory MPs and motoring groups say millions who rely on their vehicles are facing 'unbelievable financial pain'.\\nPrices have hit an all-time high of 158.2p a litre and diesel a record 165.24p thanks to the soaring price of oil after Russia's invasion.\\nAt Reading Services on the M4 yesterday, the price of both petrol and diesel soared by 5p in just one hour.\\nIf unleaded reaches 184p per litre on average, that will see the typical price of filling up reach \u00a3101.\\nTory MP Karl McCartney said the Chancellor should take 'action to cut fuel duty or VAT until prices fall'.\\nAnd motorists could face even more misery in the coming weeks \u2013 as eco-protest group Extinction Rebellion said it plans to block major UK oil refineries next month as part of its campaign to force the Government to stop using fossil fuels.\\nDockers at the Isle of Grain in Kent, Milford Haven in Wales,\u00a0Ellesmere Port on Merseyside and on the Isle of Orkney all refused to unload the fuel being sold by Putin's Russia to help pay for his invasion.\\nInstead the ships, some owned by Russian shipping companies and all carrying Russian fossil fuels, were diverted to ports in France, Belgium and Holland to unload. Two tankers are yet to find a port who will have them as the West's sanctions starts to bite.\\nThe Unite union today backed the dockers. General secretary Sharon Graham said: 'I am very proud of Unite's members taking a principled stand to prevent Russian oil coming to our ports.\\n'But it is appalling that they have been put in this position by the government, which is still dragging its feet on sanctions.'\\nOne Ellesmere Port docker, who refused to off-load the Russian oil, told Mailonline: 'There's a war on.\\n'What the Russians are doing to the Ukrainians is disgusting.\\n'There was no way I was going to handle Russian oil. They should not be here.\\n'I support Ukraine not Russia.'\\nCyprus-flagged tankers Boris Vilkitsky and Fedor Litke were last week diverted from the Isle of Grain, the largest terminal in Europe for importing liquefied natural gas.\\nThe Fedor Litke was forced to go to Belgium to unload on March 6 and is heading back to Yamal, Russia.\u00a0Boris Vilkitsky diverted from Isle of Grain to western France on March 4 and is wow heading back to the Arctic.\\nTwo other ships due in Kent at the end of February were also diverted. The\u00a0Christophe de Margerie forced to unload at Rotterdam on March 6 and is back off to Russia. The Boris Davydov was diverted to Dunkirk and now heading back to Yamal.\\nOil tanker Seacod, which sails under a German flag, left Primorsk on February 22 and arrived in Merseyside on March 3. Dockers refused to unload it and it moved on March 7, and now it appears to be heading to a European port.\\nLiberian-flagged Archelaos, carrying diesel, was en route to the Welsh port of Milford Haven and due to offload the cargo today having been filled with fuel at Primorsk in Russia. It was turned away and is heading to Antwerp. And Oil tanker\u00a0NS Champion was due to unload on Orkney on February 28 but was asked not to.

But\u00a0Lady Gaga\u00a0hid her head in her hands as her boyfriend Michael Polansky was handed one.\\nThese self-styled 'Rebel Baftas' went to nominees who had a high percentage of losing on the night, including one awkward moment she went to The Power Of The Dog star Benedict Cumberbatch, giving him 'Best Actor In The Room Who Has Just Reminded Me He Is Married' as he sat next to his wife\u00a0Sophie Hunter. She also unveiled a bizarre cake of his face, which she sliced and handed out as the Sherlock Holmes star looked perplexed.\\nAnother joke that fell flat came when Wilson said that she had planned to do a musical number on roller skates about Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, which was going to be called 'Pizza Express'.\\nThere were also off-colour gags about her 'bush', a 'weird' Daniel Craig leg tattoo and a joke about Will Smith, who won the Leading Actor award for his role in King Richard, causing the Royal Albert Hall audience to groan as she said his 'best performance in the past year was being OK with all his wife's boyfriends' - a nod to\u00a0Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith's open relationship. But there was some praise for her decision to give Vladimir Putin the middle finger over Ukraine.\\nBut Wilson was then accused of bowing to the 'woke mob' by using the prime time show on BBC1 to lay into\u00a0JK Rowling, who was at the centre of a TV ambush involving Emma Watson, 31. Miss Watson - best known for her role as Hermione Grainger in the film adaptations of Rowling's books that has made reputedly her \u00a365million ($85m) - took to the stage to present the award of Best Outstanding British Film.\\nWhen she was introduced Rebel said: 'Here to present the next award is Emma Watson.

She owes her a heck of a lot, she needs to stop biting the hand that feeds'. Another wrote: 'Emma Watson, a woman, the feminist that can't define what a woman is? The one that is famous because of JK?'\\nA red-faced Lady Gaga\\nLady Gaga's hid her head in her hands as her boyfriend Michael Polansky was handed a golden bra for a joke award. Australian actress Rebel, 42, said after setting eyes on Michael: 'Are you Lady Gaga's plus one? That is a good gig!'\\nGaga looked apprehensive as she looked on, laughing before cupping her hands over her face. She grabbed the bra off of Michael and hid it under her dress for a few seconds before retrieving it and laying it out on her lap.\\nThe Benedict Cumberbatch cake that even left the star confused\\nWilson brought out a cake shaped like Cumberbatch's face to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Bafta.\\nThe Power Of The Dog star looked totally confused as she started chopping it up after\u00a0actor and director Andy Serkis jammed a 75-shaped candle into the cake.\\nThe Australian actress said she had personally chosen the celebratory cake to be made in homage to the actor as she wanted it later for 'reasons she would not go into'.\\nEmbarrassing Benedict Cumberbatch's wife\\nShortly afterwards there was another\u00a0awkward moment when she went back to The Power Of The Dog star Benedict Cumberbatch, giving him 'Best Actor In The Room Who Has Just Reminded Me He Is Married' as he sat next to his wife Sophie Hunter.\\nShaming JK Rowling\\nWilson opened the ceremony dressed in a sparkly red gown and said: 'I might look a bit different from the last time you saw me here. That was me two years ago and since then I've done quite a transformation - I hope JK Rowling still approves.'\\nJames Bond tattoo\\nThe ceremony's host Rebel Wilson revealed a tattoo of Daniel Craig on her leg as Bafta marked 60 years of the 007 films.\\nThe Australian actress joked that she had been given special permission to reveal that she would be taking over from Daniel Craig as the next James Bond.\\nWilson added that she already had a pitch for the new Bond film where the spy goes to Australia and the movie title would be 'Die Another G'day', but said that because of the gender pay gap she would be called 004.5 instead of 007.\\nMeghan and Harry\\nRebel Wilson made a jibe at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey.\\nThe Australian actress, 42, said the special, which aired on CBS in the United States on ITV in the UK in March last year, had everything from 'drama to fantasy' but was 'unfortunately' not nominated in the Outstanding British Film category at this year's BAFTAs.\\nLosing weight for Robert Pattinson\\n'Everyone is asking me, why did you lose weight? Clearly it was to get the attention of Robert Pattinson,' she joked, adding: 'You know what they say, once you got bat, you don't go back.'\\nShe continued: 'I didn't lose weight just to get a guy, I did it to get more acting roles. I'm now so excited I can play the non-funny love interest in an Adam Sandler film.'\\nWill Smith joke\\nAfter Will Smith had won the leading actor award for King Richard, Wilson said she thought his best performance in the past year was 'being OK with all of his wife's boyfriends'.\\nAfter the crowd reacted with groans, she added: 'What? He didn't show up. You can't use Covid as an excuse any more.'\\nPartygate\\nWilson signed off from the 2022 ceremony saying: 'I can't wait for the after-party, it's going to go off, I think it's at Number 10 Downing Street. Boris just texted me.'\\nShe added: 'I hope I haven't said anything to get cancelled tonight.'\\nThe Duke of York\\nWilson joked that she had planned to do a musical number on roller skates about the Duke of York, during the ceremony, which was going to be called 'Pizza Express'.\\nHowever, she said she had scrapped the idea as she wanted to save her voice for the film sequel to Cats.\\nMiss Wilson also took aim at JK earlier in the night, as she joked about her recent weight loss. Referring to a picture of her at the 2020 ceremony that appeared on screen, she quipped: 'That was me two years ago and since then I've done quite a transformation \u2013 I hope JK Rowling still approves.'\\nMiss Rowling has faced a continued onslaught of accusations of transphobia since publishing an essay on her website in July 2020 in which she argued that biological sex is real.\\nShe also revealed she was 'a domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor'. She was labelled a TERF \u2013 trans-exclusionary radical feminist \u2013 after taking issue with the term 'people who menstruate'.\\nIn December she was once again forced to deny that she is transphobic as she argued for sex, not gender identity, to be the 'basis of decisions on safeguarding'.\\nHarry Potter stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Miss Watson and Evanna Lynch, who recently reunited for the 20th anniversary of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone without Miss Rowling, are among those who have condemned her.\\nThe author previously revealed that 'hundreds of trans activists have threatened to beat, rape, assassinate and bomb me'.\\nShe vowed to continue speaking out after she named and shamed three activists after they posed with signs reading 'Don't be a cissy,' 'Trans liberation now' and 'Trans rights are human rights' outside her house in Edinburgh in November.\\nMiss Watson led the red carpet arrivals as the event was back to full capacity for the first time in two years, following the Covid pandemic.\\nShe looked effortlessly glamorous in a statement gown with a plunging black halter-neck top and a cream tulle skirt with a train.\\nThe Harry Potter actress said she was thrilled to be at the event at 'a moment when we really are looking to cinema for inspiration, for joy, for hope and for escape and comfort'.\\nShe was joined by singer and actress Lady Gaga, 35, who wowed in a plunging forest green Ralph Lauren gown perfectly hugging her figure, with a Tiffany & Co. diamond and emerald necklace.\\nThe star, who wore her hair with a sophisticated wave, was nominated for Best Actress for her take on Patrizia Reggiani in the film House of Gucci but was beaten to the prize by Joanna Scanlan.\\nBritish star Miss Scanlan, 60, who won for her role as widow Mary Hussain in After Love, was visibly shocked as she collected her prize and told the audience: 'Some stories have surprise endings don't they?'\\nDame Shirley Bassey opened this year's ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall with a performance of the Bond theme Diamonds Are Forever in celebration of the 60th anniversary of the film franchise.\\nNo Time to Die had a disappointing evening taking home just one award, despite being nominated for five, but Lashana Lynch, 34, who played new 007 agent Nomi in the film, scooped the Rising Star award.\\nAccepting her award, Miss Lynch, who stunned in a black Prada off-the-shoulder gown clinched at the waist, said: 'I'm grateful for a working-class foundation that has taught me everything I need to know about failure, about noes and what noes mean and how to celebrate your yeses.'\\nShe later added she was going to give the prize to her mother because 'I don't know what to do with it'.\\nShe was joined at the ceremony by co-star Lea Seydoux, 36, who opted for a black and silver sequinned floor-length dress by Louis Vuitton.\\nBut Bond himself was absent from the evening as Daniel Craig decided to give the awards show a miss as he prepares for a stint on Broadway later this month.\\nThe ceremony's host, Australian comedienne Rebel Wilson, also paid tribute to the film franchise claiming she would be playing the next 007 before revealing a tattoo of Daniel Craig on her leg.\\nBritish actress Emilia Jones, the daughter of Aled Jones, also performed at the event giving an emotional rendition of Joni Mitchell's ballad Both Sides Now, accompanied by two sign language interpreters who signed the song in both British Sign Language and American Sign Language.\\nThe 20-year-old - who stunned in a Grecian inspired halter neck metallic gold gown - attended the event with her mother and grandmother but her famous father was unable to join them as he is currently on tour.\\nMiss Jones had been nominated in the leading actress category for her role as a singer in the film CODA (child of deaf adults) \u2013 which was last night crowned Best Adapted Screenplay.\\nAmerican actor Troy Kotsur won Best Supporting Actor for his role in the film, signing his speech with audience members sign clapping following his victory.\\nThroughout the evening some of those took in attendance took the opportunity to reference the situation in Ukraine, including Bafta chairman Krishnendu Majumdar who addressed the conflict in his opening speech.\\nHe said: 'We are hugely grateful to the journalists and filmmakers covering Ukraine, many of whom are Bafta members, who are bravely reporting and documenting the conflict and humanitarian crisis.'\\nHe encouraged donations to the Disasters Emergency Committee, adding: 'Our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine, as well as those affected by the many other conflicts around the world at this time.'\\nMiss Rebel Wilson, also took the opportunity to give Vladimir Putin the middle finger as she made reference to the sign language interpreters, saying: 'luckily though in all sign languages, this is the gesture for Putin,' as she raised her middle finger.\\nBenedict Cumberbatch, 45, donned a Ukrainian flag badge as he walked the red carpet in a velvet tuxedo before telling reporters on the red carpet he would like to be part of a programme taking in Ukrainian refugees.\\nAsked about the badge he was wearing, he said: 'It's all I can do tonight, is to stand by the people of Ukraine.\\n'We all need to do something more than is emblematic in this.

Which is why I need a car. If I need to go somewhere, my husband needs to drive me \u2014 and I never know when those days are going to happen.\u2019\\nSo imagine her shock on Tuesday morning when she was alerted by a neighbour to a flat tyre on her Jaguar F-Pace. A leaflet left under the windscreen wipers made it clear that this was no accidental puncture.\\n\u2018Attention \u2014 your gas guzzler kills,\u2019 the message began. \u2018We have deflated one or more of your tyres. You\u2019ll be angry, but don\u2019t take it personally. It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s your car. That\u2019s why we have taken this action. You will have no difficulty getting around without your gas guzzler, with walking, cycling or public transport.\u2019\\nNo difficulty?\\n\u2018On bad days I certainly can\u2019t walk the ten minutes to a bus stop then wait the 30 minutes for a bus that may or may not come because Bristol transport is terrible,\u2019 says Mrs Basker, who is pregnant and purposefully chose her car because its emissions were relatively low.\\n\u2018I\u2019m all in favour of action to combat climate change,\u2019 she says. \u2018But skulking around at night and damaging people\u2019s property is not the way to raise awareness. I feel we\u2019ve been subjected to bullying, intimidating behaviour. It\u2019s shocking to find out that someone has decided we\u2019re fair game just because of the car we drive, not knowing anything about us.\u2019 And Mrs Basker is far from alone in feeling that sense of anger at being targeted in this way.\\nOn the same morning, hundreds of motorists awoke not just in Bristol but in Brighton, Cambridge, Sheffield, Liverpool, London and Edinburgh to discover the air had also been let out of their car tyres.\\nWhile all had the same note attached, their sense of confusion was compounded by the fact that not all the vehicles were petrol or diesel \u2014 some were hybrid or fully electric.\\nBut what they did all have in common was they were all sport utility vehicles (SUVs). These cars are generally larger than standard cars and have off-road capabilities such as high ground clearance. Some are four-wheel drive. The fact that they are often used in urban settings \u2014 rather than negotiating muddy lanes \u2014 has led them to be dubbed \u2018Chelsea Tractors\u2019. Chelsea relates to the fact that they first became trendy in upmarket areas.\\nThey are also increasingly popular. In the past decade, sales have increased from about 6 per cent of all vehicles sold in the UK to 20 per cent. And there, say environmentalists, lies the problem.\\nThe bigger the car, the more they pollute. And it is not just exhaust emissions. Because they are heavier it is claimed even the brake pads and tyres of hybrid or electric versions degrade more quickly, causing harmful particles to be released into the air.\\nAnd so it was that on Monday night a new front on the eco-war opened as a group calling themselves the Tyre Extinguishers launched a co-ordinated effort to deflate the tyres of as many SUVs as they could.\\nSeemingly unconcerned that their actions might stop a doctor or nurse getting to work or the danger that an unnoticed flat tyre might pose to the driver and other road users, the activists warn that this is just the start of it.\\n\u2018We are prepared to risk our life and liberty to protect people from climate change, air pollution and unnecessary death on our roads,\u2019 a spokesperson told the Daily Mail.\\n\u2018We will make it impossible to own an SUV in the world\u2019s urban areas.\u2019\\nPrecisely who is behind the new shadowy group, which claims to be leaderless, remains unclear.\\nBut their decision to take direct action that affects the lives of ordinary members of the public mimics the tactics of Extinction Rebellion (XR) and Insulate Britain, whose protests have gridlocked cities and roads in recent years.\\nWhile the Tyre Extinguishers deny they are affiliated to any other organisation, when it set up a Twitter account last summer, the very first group it followed was Extinction Rebellion. Not that its aims and activities haven\u2019t been attempted elsewhere before.\\nMore than a decade ago, a Swedish group calling itself the Indians of the Concrete Jungle started targeting the tyres of SUVs, cocerned about their environmental impact.\\nGlobally, the number of SUVs has increased from less than 50 million in 2010 to around 320 million last year \u2014 equivalent to the total car fleet of Europe. Because of their size, on average, SUVs consume around a quarter more energy than medium-sized cars.\\nA 2019 study by the International Energy Agency found that they rank among the top contributors to energy-related carbon dioxide emissions growth over the past decade \u2014 cancelling out the reductions from people switching to electric cars. Because of their size, they are also said to be more dangerous when involved in an accident.\\nOf course, some of those SUVs are owned by people who need their 4 x 4 capabilities for work or because of where they live \u2014 for example farmworkers and those based in remote rural areas.\\nFor this reason, the new group of activists is focussing its efforts on city-dwellers. And not just any city-dwellers \u2014 but \u2018posh\u2019, white city-dwellers. \u2018SUV drivers tend to be richer, and therefore tend to be white,\u2019 the group claims.\\n\u2018Three quarters of these \u201coff-road\u201d vehicles are sold to people living in towns and cities.\\n\u2018They exist purely for the vanity of their owners, who see them as a status symbol. For the sake of this vanity and conspicuous consumption, climate change is made worse, we breathe in polluted air, and more people die in accidents.\\n\u2018This is unacceptable. In addition, air pollution is racist; people of colour live in areas more likely to be exposed to toxic air.\u2019 Of course, as some have pointed out, targeting cars in wealthy suburbs may also make life easier for the activists.\\nAs one of their victims observed last week: \u2018If they are anything like the Extinction Rebellion activists then they will probably be white and middle-class themselves \u2014 so at least they won\u2019t have to travel too far.\u2019 If that sounds unduly stereotypical then their list of advice on \u2018how to deflate a tyre\u2019 is beyond parody.\\n\u2018Unscrew the cap on the tyre valve,\u2019 it begins. \u2018Usually, you turn the cap to the left to unscrew it, right to tighten it. Remember: righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.\\n\u2018To get the air out of the tyre, there must be something pushing down on the pin located in the centre of the valve. Drop a small bean (we like green lentils, but you can experiment with couscous, bits of gravel, etc) inside the valve cap. Replace the cap, screwing it on with a few turns until you hear air hissing out.\\n\u2018Even if it\u2019s only hissing out a little bit, that\u2019s enough \u2014 it will deflate slowly. The whole process should take about 10 seconds.\u2019\\nAmong the hardest hit were those in Brighton. Boasting not just the country\u2019s only Green MP but a Green council to boot, the city was last year voted the UK\u2019s most eco-friendly. So imagine the shock of residents living in one of its most middle-class suburbs when they awoke on Tuesday morning to discover that they, of all people, had been branded enemies of the environment.\\nKatie Wood, who found that three tyres on her Kia Sportage had been let down, was one of them.\\nAn educational psychologist, she was two hours late for work as she tracked down a portable pump and then headed to a garage to top up her tyres.\\n\u2018I\u2019d use public transport if I could but, because I work in a variety of different locations, I need a car to travel,\u2019 said the 41-year-old.\\n\u2018My car can in no way be described as a \u201cChelsea Tractor\u201d. It has a relatively small engine and its emissions are low.\u2019\\nShe added: \u2018The tactics used on this occasion are wrong. Everyone wants to help reduce climate change and are doing what they can but in order to effect real change they should be winning hearts and minds.\u2019\\nNearby, Rob Derkin was equally outraged at being singled out. When he left to take his daughter to college he spotted that three tyres on his Volkswagen T-Roc were flat.\\nUnscrewing the valve caps, he discovered telltale dried legumes within. \u2018It\u2019s ridiculous that they targeted this car because it has a 1-litre engine and low emissions,\u2019 the 58-year-old music composer said. \u2018I specifically chose it because of its low emissions.\\n\u2018All this campaign serves to do is make people angry and reinforces the image of activists. It reeks of student idealism \u2014 it\u2019s so Brighton that a lentil was involved.\u2019\\nHe added: \u2018If they\u2019re going to continue with this campaign then they need to brush up on what cars have high emissions and which ones to avoid because at the moment they are targeting the wrong people.\u2019\\nIt was a point echoed by Neil Longuet-Higgins, 61, who was moving house on Tuesday morning and spotted one of the tyres on his Porsche Cayenne was flat as he went to meet the removals van. The car is a hybrid, meaning it can travel around 20 miles on battery power alone.\\n\u2018The car I had before was a diesel but I changed it and because I live and work around Brighton I only really use the electric element of the car,\u2019 he said.\\nThe disruption caused by the flat tyre ended up costing him more than \u00a3500. Driving to two garages \u2014 in vain \u2014 to find an air pump caused damage to the tyre, forcing him to pay \u00a3250 for a replacement. Because of the delay, he also had to pay the removal firm for an extra two hours of their time.\\nIn London, motorists were targeted in Chelsea, Chiswick, Harley Street, Hampstead Heath, Notting Hill, Belgravia, and Clapham. One victim in the capital pointed out that he had had to re-inflate his tyres using a portable pump powered via his car cigarette lighter.\\n\u2018I had my engine running for 45 minutes while I inflated my tyres so thanks for helping me pollute the environment even more you numpties,\u2019 he wrote on Twitter.\\nOthers complained that if you have three young children it is very hard to find a car smaller than an SUV that will fit three car seats side-by-side in the back seat.\\nOf those who had their tyres deflated, a number contacted police to complain about what had happened \u2014 with differing responses.\\nIn Bristol, Mrs Basker was told that the incident would be logged as antisocial behaviour.\\nMeanwhile, police in Brighton, Liverpool and Cambridge were said to be investigating the incidents as possible criminal damage.\\nTo satisfy the offence a tyre would not have to be damaged in any way \u2014 the fact that the owner has to take steps to return it to a working condition is sufficient.\\nWere someone to be hurt as a result of the action then more serious charges might apply, depending on the resulting damage or injury.\\nOf course, tracing the perpetrators is unlikely to be easy. A photograph released on Tuesday showed an activist working under the cover of darkness and with their face obscured by a hoodie.\\nAnd what about forensic clues?

It is part of a wider wave of eco groups organised by Extinction Rebellion.\\nAR is an extremist faction of XR which wants all animal farming and fishing banned. One of the principal beliefs behind the campaign is meat and fish products have a greater carbon footprint than vegetables.\\nIt is argued about 7kg of carbon dioxide is emitted in the production of a day's food for someone on a meat-rich diet, whereas it is just 4kg for a vegetarian or 3kg for a vegan. Thus, they claim, veganism is the only way to prevent environmental catastrophe.\\nThis belief \u2014 vigorously disputed by the National Farmers' Union among others \u2014 has gained momentum with, for example, Cambridge University which removed beef and lamb from its menus in 2016.\\nAR compares its efforts to ban meat, fish and dairy products to the 19th-century campaign against slavery. They say they are following in the footsteps of a long list of people including Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi.\\n'We declare rebellion against the Government and the animal agriculture and fishing industries,' they say. 'We are not simply here to disrupt . . . For the sake of all life, these industries must end.'\\nThe move comes on the back of Seaspiracy, who proved popular on Netflix by slamming firms such as the Marine Stewardship Council.\\nThe film claimed the non-profit was funded by licensing fees paid by the fisheries and supermarkets that were given its coveted blue tick.\\nMeanwhile reports emerged last year products with the accreditation were worth \u00a39billion in 2020 alone amid claims it did not support sustainable fishing.\\nThe Marine Stewardship Council blasted today's stunt, saying it was 'wholly unacceptable that our staff who are working to protect the oceans should be intimidated in this way'.\\nA spokesman added:\u00a0'We're shocked that Animal Rebellion has targeted the Marine Stewardship Council in this way.\\n'The MSC is a not-for-profit organisation, working with NGOs, scientists, governments and the fishing industry to protect the ocean, endangered species and fish stocks.\\n'We empower retailers and consumers to choose seafood from fishers who are taking care of our precious ocean.\\n'Targeting the MSC's office will do nothing to stop fishing \u2013 instead it hurts an organisation making a positive difference.

I didn\u2019t know what the crowd was going to do, I was overreacting in my mind.\\n\u2018I went to the most catastrophic conclusion. People were making death threats, I thought my life was in danger and the last thing I wanted to do was get down.\u2019\\nMee said he expected to receive a \u2018serious, serious beating\u2019 if got off the train. \u2018As it happened, there were a few people who wanted to put the boot in, none of them really connected. The crowd very quickly pacified after we were brought down.\u2019\\nAsked about footage of him kicking out at a passenger who reached up to grab him, Mee said he felt guilty about breaking Extinction Rebellion\u2019s code of non-violence.\\nMr Blackman played footage of Mee and Ovland climbing onto the train, after which a passenger approaches shouts and throws a sandwich at them.\\nThe prosecutor asked: \u2018Within a minute of you getting on that train people are already angry, aren\u2019t they? Did you not think at that stage, it\u2019s not going where you want, should we not get off now?\u2019.\\n\u2018You can see in the footage someone throws a sandwich,\u2019 replied Mee. \u2018At that point there was less fear of our safety from violence in the crowd.\\n\u2018We were there to do a protest and there\u2019s that human psychology in that it\u2019s harder to abandon something you\u2019ve started and as things got more violent it became harder to come down.\u2019\\nMee, of Bristol, and Ovland, of Somerset, denied but were convicted of obstructing engines or carriages on railways under the Malicious Damages Act 1861.\\nMee has nine previous convictions for 14 offences, the most recent being criminal damage on 9 December 2019, two months after this offence took place.\\nOvland was in breach of a conditional discharge that he received on October 14, 2019 for gluing himself to the doors of the InterContinental Hotel London Park Lane while a BP conference in relation to oil and gas was taking place.

In a reference to the recent film they wore T-shirts reading 'Just look up' and 'Just Stop Oil'.\\nIn statements shared on the Just Stop Oil website, Claudia, 23, said: 'I am here supporting Just Stop Oil because I am absolutely terrified about our future.\\n'Last year the UK government's former chief scientific advisor warned us that what we do within the next 3-4 years will determine the future of humanity.\\n'Yet our government, knowing this, knowing that continuing to support the oil industry is a death sentence for us all, remains determined to drag us down this path of suffering and destruction. And the mainstream media doesn't care.\\n'So we are asking those with power and influence to use it, to do what is necessary, and use their platform to demand the government just stop oil. We have to act like our lives depend on it, because they do.'\\nDillon Parsons, 20, an aspiring filmmaker at the University for the Creative Arts, said:\u00a0'I don't want to disrupt the BAFTAS but feel I have no choice because of the danger we are all in.\\n'This is not a protest against the BAFTAs or the film industry, nor is it a publicity stunt. We couldn't care less who wins what award. This is a cry for help from a generation who has the most to lose.'\\nThe group say actions will continue to escalate until the government makes a meaningful commitment to stop new fossil fuel.\\nLast month Just Stop Oil supporters delivered a letter to Downing Street asking the PM to bring an end to investment in new fossil fuel supply projects and warning the group will take direct action if they do.\\nJust Stop Oil said a reply received by the group from BEIS indicates the government has no intention of ending new fossil fuel supply.\\nA spokesman for Bafta said the activists did not cause any disruption to the ceremony and guests were re-rerouted away from the protest, which they described as peaceful.\\nThey added the demonstrators were able to access the red carpet from the street but did not gain access to any restricted areas.\\nMeanwhile Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week said Saudi Arabia could 'help people at the petrol pumps' amid the ongoing crisis. His comments came after inconclusive talks with the country's controversial ruler.\\nMohammed bin Salman has been de facto leader of Saudi Arabia since 2017 when he was made Crown Prince following a brutal round of intrigue. But he split opinion from the start with alleged his ruthless treatment of rivals.\\nAnd 'MBS' has been shunned by much of the West since the US intelligence community alleged he ordered the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi. The US-based journalist was a vocal critic of Saudi Arabia's rulers before his slaying and dismemberment in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, in 2018.\\nThe wider human rights record of the Kingdom has also been called into question. Mr Johnson's trip also came just days after the execution of 81 people, the largest\u00a0mass execution in the kingdom in modern history.\\nThousands of civilian deaths have also been linked to airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition fighting the war against the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Amnesty International UK has warned about Saudi Arabia becoming 'increasingly repressive' under Prince bin Salman.\\nPolly Truscott, the organisation's foreign affairs human rights adviser, added: 'The key point is that Saudi oil shouldn't be allowed to buy the world's silence over Saudi Arabia's terrible human rights record.'\\nMike Davis, the chief executive of the Global Witness human rights organisation, said Mr Johnson is 'absolutely right' to take action against Russia but said it 'does not mean we should be subjected to the grotesque spectacle of the British Prime Minister cosying up to Mohammed bin Salman'.\\nTory former minister Crispin Blunt urged Mr Johnson to make clear Britain's concerns to the crown prince, calling the executions a 'new low for human rights' in the kingdom.\\nConservative Julian Lewis, who chairs Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, called on the Government to assure that 'in seeking to lessen our dependence upon one source of oil and gas, we do not end up creating a source dependency on another unreliable and sometimes hostile regime'.\\nThe Prime Minister failed to finalise a deal in the desert on increasing oil production during almost two hours of talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh.\\nBut speaking after the meeting, he described the discussions as 'very productive' and said it was vital to keep talking to the Saudis despite their abysmal human rights record.\\nOpposition MPs had urged Mr Johnson to cancel the visit after Saudi Arabia carried out the mass execution of 81 prisoners at the weekend.\\nIn an embarrassing development, the state-run Saudi Press Agency announced three more individuals had been executed on the day of Mr Johnson's visit. Last night, the PM said he had raised human rights with the leader.\\nBut he added: 'We also talked about what we can do to stabilise oil prices, to fight inflation, to help consumers, to help people at the gas pumps, at the petrol pumps, and a lot of agreement that it is important to avoid inflation, to avoid the damaging economic consequences, agreement that we need to work together to bring peace to Ukraine.'\\nThe PM was asked whether states like Saudi Arabia who are members of the oil producers' cartel Opec understood the importance of increasing supplies at a time when the West is trying to wean itself off Russian oil and gas.\\nHe replied: 'There's an interest for Saudi Arabia, for all oil-producing and exporting countries, in making sure that the global economy is not damaged by the current spikes, that we don't get the kind of inflation that we saw in the 1970s, we don't see the stagflation. So it was a very productive conversation.'\\nBut pressed on if he had won a decision on increasing supply to reduce the shock of the West moving away from Russian fuel, he said: 'I think you need to talk to the Saudis about that.'\\nMr Johnson, who shook hands with the Saudi crown prince accused of ordering the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, insisted closer ties with the kingdom did not mean 'we can't stick to our principles'.\\nAt his first stop in Abu Dhabi, where he met UAE Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, Mr Johnson pointed towards Saudi Arabia announcing a \u00a31billion investment in green aviation fuel in Teesside.\\n'That's the kind of thing we want to encourage - doesn't in any way mean we can't stick to our principles and raise those issues that we all care about.'\\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the PM of 'going cap in hand from dictator to dictator', which he said was 'not an energy strategy'. But he stopped short of saying Labour would boycott Saudi oil.\\nMaya Foa, director of human rights advocacy group Reprieve, said the Saudis' decision to execute three people while Mr Johnson was visiting was a 'provocative act, designed to flaunt the crown prince's power and impunity to the world'.", "image": [["An eco-zealot who strapped himself to a goalpost during the Everton versus Newcastle football match last night is an Insulate Britain protester who bragged about being welcomed in prison", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/03/18/08/55490821-10626625-A_protester_brought_Everton_s_game_against_Newcastle_to_a_halt_a-a-1_1647593752538.jpg"], ["Louis McKechnie stormed the pitch half way through the Premier League bout and zip-tied himself to the woodwork wearing a bright orange t-shirt saying: 'Just stop oil'", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/03/18/08/55491019-10626625-Stewards_and_security_staff_struggled_to_free_him_with_a_cable_t-a-4_1647593762131.jpg"], ["The 21-year-old halted play for seven minutes before the stadium's staff prised him free with a huge pair of bolt cutters and hauled him off the pitch", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/03/18/08/55491025-10626625-A_large_pair_of_bolt_cutters_were_brought_out_with_the_supporter-a-5_1647593770493.jpg"], ["Ahead of the latest climate stunt to hit the UK, he released a rambling video trying to justify himself (pictured), claiming 'as many people as possible need to know what a possible future holds'", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/03/18/09/55507893-10626625-image-a-28_1647595392031.jpg"], ["Tim Speers, Roman Paluch, Emma Smart, Ben Taylor, James Thomas, Louis McKechnie, Ana Heyatawin and Oliver Roc from Insulate Britain are pictured in November", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/03/18/09/55507487-10626625-image-a-26_1647595223981.jpg"], ["Despite his age, McKechnie is a seasoned disruptor who has caused havoc in recent months with Insulate Britain's protests on major UK roads", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/03/18/08/55491031-10626625-Both_sets_of_players_watched_on_with_bemusement_during_the_attem-a-7_1647593802898.jpg"], ["The mechanical engineering student was one of nine demonstrators hauled to the High Court for breaking a government injunction stopping the thugs gluing themselves to carriageways including the M25 last year", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/03/18/08/55491035-10626625-Eventually_the_long_haired_man_was_freed_and_escorted_off_the_fi-a-9_1647593814045.jpg"], ["The lout was locked up for three months in HMP Thameside, but on his release after half that time he boasted how he had been 'terrified' but was welcomed by other lags who he claimed were 'entertained' by his protests", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/03/18/08/55491037-10626625-The_tie_the_fan_used_to_attach_himself_to_the_goal_post_on_one_s-a-11_1647593824650.jpg"], ["Pictured: Eco-zealots targeted the Bafta film awards and launched a protest on the red carpet where they chanted Just Stop Oil last week", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/03/18/08/55303573-10626625-Pictured_Eco_zealots_have_targeted_the_Bafta_film_awards_and_lau-a-13_1647593843313.jpg"], ["Protesters outside the Royal Albert Hall in London could be heard chanting 'just stop oil' and banging drums while surrounded by a barrier of police", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/03/18/08/55303805-10626625-Activists_during_a_protest_by_Just_Stop_Oil_near_the_Royal_Alber-a-17_1647593868253.jpg"], ["The Downing Street readout of Boris Johnson's discussions with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (right) only made a vague reference to oil, while the Saudis did not mention it at all", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/03/17/09/55466737-10622791-image-a-2_1647509642090.jpg"]], "author": ["James Gant For Mailonline"], "date": "2022-03-18"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10633821/Meet-boho-yoga-mums-spreading-dangerous-anti-vaxx-myths-online.html": {"title": "A 'psychotherapeutic counsellor' from the Netherlands and a 'declutterer' who supports Extinction Rebellion...
