Their next of kin are aware and are being supported by specialist officers.\\nThe latest Just Stop Oil demonstrations have been brought on following a heatwave that saw the UK record its hottest ever day on Tuesday.\\nTemperatures hit an unprecedented 40.3C (104.54) in Coningsby, Lincolnshire, yesterday beating records.\\nA Just Oil spokesperson added: 'The main thing is, we've just seen 40 degree temperatures, which have been predicted for decades, maybe it's happening a bit faster.\\n'But it has just revealed how inadequate the Government's preparations for climate change are and their entire policy, and basically we're just saying it's evident now we cannot continue.\\n'As we're going on, we need to stop new oil. It's the first step to ensuring we have a liveable future, and maybe it's already too late. This is something we definitely need to do.'\\n\\n\\nThe group has chosen the M25 as the site of the action as it is 'the place where we confront the carbon economy headlong and bring our resistance into full public view.\\nIt added: 'The M25 has a kind of iconic status as the motorway from hell, doesn't it? So it's a reference to that.'\\nThe group demands the government make a 'meaningful statement' that they will commit to stop licensing and consents for the exploration, development and production of fossil fuels in the UK, which they say is 'the necessary first step to ensuring a liveable future'.\\nMs Gethin said: 'I am terrified by the extreme heat in the UK this week, knowing that this will only get worse as we continue to extract and burn more and more fossil fuels.\\n'This country has the technology and money to begin a just and rapid transition immediately using renewable energy, insulation and cheap public transport, but our government refuses to do so.\\n'I feel it is my duty as a human being to demand change in a way that cannot be ignored.'\\nAnd Ms Percy-Ratcliff added: 'I joined Just Stop Oil because I was worried about my future, about my sister\u2019s future, but I think a lot of us have realised this week that we\u2019re not talking about the future, we\u2019re talking about now.\\n'It was 40 degrees this week, and thousands of deaths are predicted across the country due to the heat. The government will not stop pushing fossil fuels; we have to stop them.'\\nJust Stop Oil will march and take part in a sit down protest in Westminster on Saturday 'with thousands of ordinary people' to create 'mass civil resistance' - calling for the public to join them.\\nA spokesperson for the National Police Chiefs' Council said: 'The ability to protest peacefully in a democracy is important and where lawful, forces will seek to facilitate protests - but even if a protest is peaceful and non-violent, this doesn't always mean the actions taken by protestors are legal.\\n'At a time of significant demand on emergency services, if officers are on the roads resolving this disruption they aren't available elsewhere preventing crime and keeping the public safe.'\\nToday's demonstrations come two weeks after activists from the same group glued themselves to the frame of a copy of Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper at the Royal Academy of Arts in London.\\nExtinction Rebellion co-founder Simon Bramwell was among those involved on July 5, along with fellow XR activist Caspar Hughes.\\nJust Stop Oil also named three of the protesters as Jessica Agar, 21, an art student from Hereford; Tristan Strange, 40, a community organiser from Swindon; and Lucy Porter, 47, a former teacher from Leeds.\\nThe activists entered The Collection Gallery at the Royal Academy just and glued their hands to the base of the painting.\\nSecurity quickly responded and cleared visitors away before trying to prise the activists off the artwork.\\nPolice arrived nearly an hour later and arrested them on suspicion of criminal damage.\\nThat action took place days after protestors glued themselves to works by JMW Turner, Vincent van Gogh and Horatio McCulloch in London, Glasgow and Manchester to warn against 'a future of suffering'.\\nOn July 3, Just Stop Oil activists\u00a0stormed the track of the British Grand Prix at Silverstone.\\nPictures from trackside showed a small group of

When the Government acts on the climate crisis, acts on fuel poverty and stands up for its own people.'\\nThe latest action comes amid warnings that the Provence region in southeastern France, depicted in Van Gogh's peach tree painting, may soon be experiencing a drought after\u00a0rainfall levels were 45 per cent below historic averages.\\nJust Stop Oil, which has previously carried out protests at oil terminals and the UK Government offices in Edinburgh, said it is calling for art institutions to join the group in 'civil resistance' against climate change.\\nMcKechnie, from Weymouth in Dorset, said: 'As a kid I used to love this painting, my dad took me to see it when we visited London. I still love this painting, but I love my friends and family more, I love nature more. I value the future survival of my generation more highly than my public reputation.\\n'The scientists are saying we need to end fossil fuel licensing and the government is pouring sand in their ears. I'm not willing to be marched to my death by the fossil fuel companies and their government puppets.\\n'It is immoral for cultural institutions to stand by and watch whilst our society descends into collapse. Galleries should close. Directors of art institutions should be calling on the government to stop all new oil and gas projects immediately. We are either in resistance or we are complicit.'\\nThe second protestor at today's art gallery was Emily Brocklebank, 24, who is a psychology student from Leeds.\\nShe added: 'I'm taking action today because I can't live in a bubble of normality when society is collapsing around us and people in the global south are suffering so much.\\n'Billionaires are getting richer whilst nurses queue at food banks, tens of millions of people across the world are starving and half the world's population is exposed to extreme danger from heatwaves, floods, fires and famine. Meanwhile the art establishment, the politicians and the fossil fuel companies look the other way.\\n'I love art, everywhere I go I visit all the galleries. Art is so important, it captures history and a moment in time, but artists and the art establishment are failing us by focusing on the wrong things. We need everyone to focus on the government's genocidal plans to allow fossil fuel companies to drill for more oil. This is one of the greatest injustices in history.

I'm on this road because I'm terrified of the world my children and the people I love will come to know.\\n'I do my best to do what seems right and necessary to me. To prevent millions of people from living in a world of immense suffering, wars and famines.\\n'I am determined to do everything in my power, rather than remain in denial and inaction where our government takes refuge. I can't be 100 per cent sure what I'm doing is the best solution, but I know it'll always be better than not trying.'\\nMany did not take so kindly to the protestors' actions however, with several social media users in France expressing their disapproval at the 'pathetic' attempts to stop the historic bike race.\\n''Again with these charlatans... take action that is useful and not counterproductive... because no one supports you with your extremist positions,' one user wrote, while another tweeted: 'Their battle is lost - you don't change the mentality of 66 millions people by blocking an event of French heritage'.\\nMost seemed to sympathise with the cause, but disagreed with the way in which DR tried to raise awareness.\\n'I understand the group's motivations - but not by doing this kind of thing at such a cycling event... Frankly pathetic, especially since pro cyclists almost fell because of you... that's pathetic,' one user said.\\nDuring a protest on Friday, six protesters - four men and two women - were arrested by French police for another disruption attempt and are set to be hauled into court in November to face trial.\\n'At the end of their police custody, the six people were summoned to appear on November 22, 2022 before the Auch criminal court to be tried on the count of obstructing the circulation of vehicles', Jacques-Edouard Andrault said in a statement.\\nThey are likely to face a two-year prison sentence and a fine of 4,500 euros, local media reported.\\nOther DR members let off a smoke bomb about 95 miles from the stage's finish line, between the villages of Boucagn\u00e8res and Auterive, while five activists glued and chained themselves to the road.\\nPhilippe Gilbert, a rider competing in his final Tour de France, said on Friday: 'It's a bit disappointing because there are other ways to protest. I hope they will be punished in proportion to their stupidity.'\\nFive people were also arrested trying block Stage 15 of the Tour De France on July 17, the group also said.\\nDR spokesperson Sasha Cantet said: 'In the absence of a bill on the energy renovation of buildings, which is all the more necessary in the context of the war in Ukraine, we will continue to disrupt the normal functioning of the country, its infrastructure and sports competitions.'\\nThe 10th stage of the Tour de France was also halted for 10 minutes earlier this month after half a dozen climate activists tried to block riders before being hurled out of the road by police and a senior Tour official.\\nThe activists sat on the road some 22 miles from the finish in Megeve on July 12.\\nThe activists were pulled off the road by police, helped by Tour organisers' Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) general director Yann Le Moenner.\\nDR also targeted the French Open on June 3 with demonstrations.\u00a0A young woman ran onto the\u00a0men's semifinals and tied her neck to the net while wearing a T-shirt saying: 'We have 1,028 days left'.\\nByKaya Terryand Adam Solomons For MailOnline\\nThis is the moment an Italian security guard tears protestors' hands off a priceless Botticelli painting at a Florence art gallery - in stark contrast to guards at London's National Gallery, who simply watched on when eco-zealots did the same.\\nThe out-of-patience security official stormed over to the young pair and pulled their superglued hands from the Renaissance masterpiece shortly after they began their short-lived protest in the Uffizi Gallery on Friday morning.\\nIt struck a jarring contrast to the inaction shown by British guards at the Trafalgar Square gallery this month, where Just Stop Oil zealots were allowed to cover over\u00a0John Constable's The Hay Wain with their own version.\\nMore than an hour later, Brighton students Hannah Hunt, 23, and Eben Lazarus, 22, were finally arrested.\\nYesterday's protest in northern Italy was perpetrated by an unnamed man and two women from climate activist group Ultima Generazione ('Last Generation').\\nThey rolled out a banner which read: 'Last Generation No Gas No Coal'.\\nThe activists, who had paid for tickets to get into the gallery, were removed from the gallery by police.\\nLuckily, no damage was caused to the artwork due to the 'special protections in place'.\\nA statement from the gallery read: 'If there had not been the special protections decided for the main masterpieces of the museum a few years ago by the management, today we would have had an important damage to the work, as happened recently in other museums.'\\nHowever the group posted a statement to their website explaining they make sure they take 'great care' and research artwork to not cause damage.\\nThey wrote: 'We have taken great care in order not to cause any damage to Botticelli's Primavera. Neither the frame nor the glass that protects the canvas was exposed to a risk.\\n'To make sure, we consulted restorers who advised us to use a glue suitable for glass and frames. It is important for us to value art, rather than damage it, as our governments do with the only planet at our disposal.'\\nThe protest comes after Just Stop Oil activists provoked fury earlier this month when they carried out a protest at the National Gallery by covering John Constable's The Hay Wain with their own version featuring double yellow lines, pollution and a washing machine.\\nTwo students who are eco demonstrators covered the world-famous painting in London with a mock 'undated' version including aircraft, before gluing their hands to the frame in a protest against UK oil and gas projects on 4 July.\\nThe group said their reimagined version of the 1821 priceless work, which depicts a rural scene on the River Stour in Suffolk, shows a 'nightmare scene that demonstrates how oil will destroy our countryside'.\\nArt historians and experts have all raised concerns that the vandals, two Brighton university students who have appeared at Just Stop Oil protests before, could have caused irreparable damage to the 19th century masterpiece.\\nThe National Gallery later released a statement clarifying The Hay Wain suffered minor damage to its frame and on the painting's varnish, both of which have been dealt with before it is re-hung in Gallery Room 34.\\nDr Adrian Hilton, who is a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, previously said: 'How is this even possible in the National Gallery? I mean, it's a John Constable masterpiece; a national treasure. Is it really this easy to paper over or - God forbid - destroy it?'\\nJust Stop Oil activists have carried out similar protests over the past month at art galleries in Glasgow, Manchester and London - while the group blocked a motorway on Wednesday, causing nine hours of traffic chaos on the M25.\\nThree eco-activists accused of sparking nine hours of traffic chaos by climbing on to the gantry above the M25 are set for trial after pleading not guilty.\\nCressida Gethin, 20, Alexander Wilcox, 21, and Emma Mani, 45, are charged with causing a public nuisance following a Just Stop Oil demonstration on Wednesday morning.\\nThey are accused of forcing the motorway to close in both directions by climbing on an overhead gantry and unfurling banners.\\nThey pleaded not guilty at Ealing Magistrates' Court in west London on Friday.\\nThe defendants allegedly harnessed themselves to Junctions 14 and 15 on the south-west side in Surrey.\u00a0The 117-mile M25 encircles London.\\nGethin, of Dorstone, Herefordshire; Wilcox, of South Fifth Street, Milton Keynes; and Mani, of High Street, Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, were released on bail.\\nThey will next appear at Inner London Crown Court on August 19.\\n'Police were notified that protesters were planning on causing disruption on the M25 and therefore police arrived at the scene,' said Beata Murphy prosecuting at Ealing magistrates court.\\n'The decision was made to stop the traffic on the road because it was simply too dangerous and the protesters kept moving across the gantry.\\n'There were lengthy tailbacks in both directions. At Heathrow Airport several flights were unable to take off because the staff were unable to get to work.'\\nThe court was told that in total 26 flights were delayed because of the demonstration by Just Stop Oil at the Poyle Interchange, causing 'incredible loss to the airlines.'\\nMs Murphy added: 'The protesters had harnesses on for safety and stuck to the gantry.\\n'Once police were on top of the gantry, protesters went limp and would not comply putting themselves and officers in danger.'\\nDefence counsel for Mani, Mr John Briant, said: 'This is a complex case involving multiple statements and witnesses.\\n'I anticipate complex legal arguments and it is totally appropriate to be trialled in the crown court.\\n'There are going to be Article 10 and 11 arguments in terms of Human Rights.\\n'There will be legal arguments about whether the action amounted to a public nuisance. If it did amount to a public nuisance was there a reasonable excuse.'\\nHe added: 'There will be arguments about recklessness and arguments about the police and how they reacted and about whether it is proportionate to prosecute.'\\nThe case was sent to the crown court because of its 'unusual legal complexity.'\\nIn a statement released shortly before the demonstrations, Just Stop Oil said it was 'declaring the M25 a site of civil resistance' this week.", "image": [["Hero Tour de France fans have taken justice into the own hands to remove eco-protesters threatening to disrupt the event by blocking the road.

Just Stop Oil also named three of the protesters as Jessica Agar, 21, an art student from Hereford; Tristan Strange, 40, a community organiser from Swindon; and Lucy Porter, 47, a former teacher from Leeds.\\nThe protesters also sprayed painted the phrase 'no new oil' below the 20ft painting, which depicts a scene from the Gospel of John in the Bible when Jesus Christ announces that one of his 12 apostles will betray him.\\nThey entered The Collection Gallery at the Academy just after 11.30am, and glued their hands to the base of the painting. Security quickly responded and cleared visitors away before trying to prise the activists off the artwork.\\nA Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'At 11.37am on July 5, police were called to Burlington House, Piccadilly following reports that protestors had glued themselves to artwork. Officers are in attendance. The incident is ongoing.'\\nThe copy in the Royal Academy was painted around 1520 and is almost the same size as the original - but missing the top third of da Vinci's composition, which is on the wall of the Santa Maria delle Grazie church in Milan.\\nThe value of the London work is not known, but will likely be worth tens of millions of pounds because the original is estimated to be worth at least \u00a3375million ($450million). The only other official copy is located in Switzerland.\\nIt comes less than 24 hours after two climate change activists from the same protest group glued themselves to the frame of John Constable's masterpiece The Hay Wain at the National Gallery while security guards watched on.\\nThe action also follows protestors from the group last week glued themselves to works by JMW Turner, Vincent van Gogh, and Horatio McCulloch in London, Glasgow and Manchester to warn against 'a future of suffering'.\\nJust Stop Oil are calling for the Government to commit to halt new oil and gas licenses in the UK and for the directors, employees and members of art institutions to join their coalition in 'peaceful civil resistance'.\\nOne of the protesters at the Royal Academy, Ms Agar, said today: 'No painting is worth more than my six-month old nephew's life. No sculpture can feed babies starving because extreme heat killed food crops.\\n'Nurses are lining up outside food banks, not galleries. If the directors of this gallery really believe that art has the power to change the world then I demand that they claim that power, close and refuse to open until the government commits to no new oil.'\\nMs Agar, who wore an orange Just Stop Oil T-Shirt, added: 'I am an art student but there is no place for me to follow my calling as an artist in a world where I have no future.\\n'In no uncertain terms, the establishment - of which the Royal Academy is a part - has condemned me and all young people to suffer. I am outraged and you should be too.'\\nAnother protester, Ms Porter, said: 'When I was teaching I brought my students to great institutions like the Royal Academy. But now it feels unfair to expect them to respect our culture when their government is hellbent on destroying their future by licensing new oil and gas projects.\\n'We have no time left, to say that we do is a lie. We must halt all new oil and gas right now, we will stop disrupting art institutions as soon as the government makes a meaningful statement to do so. Until then, the disruption will continue so that young people know we are doing all we can for them. There is nothing I would rather be doing.'\\nAnd Mr Strange added: 'I'm terrified for our future. We are heading for a collapse of our food supply and a world in which only the rich can feed themselves comfortably.\\n'Time is running out to change course or prepare for disaster and the message is not reaching the public: there is no free pass, we are all in this together and we must all rise up in civil resistance to force the government to stop new oil and gas.\\n'Da Vinci said that art is the Queen of all sciences communicating knowledge to all the generations of the world. The science still isn't being heard.\\n'We are continually fed comforting lies that downplay the urgency of the climate crisis we face so that fossil fuel interests can continue to reap huge profits whilst the global south and our children are condemned to live in a potential hell.\\n'I call on all artists to harness every ounce of their creativity sounding the alarm in the hope that it cuts through the misinformation. Nothing is more critical at the moment.'\\nThe group were led by Simon Bramwell, who apologised for disrupting other visitors but added: 'The truth is that any new oil expansion is a death sentence for the future.'\\nThe protesters involved in yesterday's action at the National Gallery were named by Just Stop Oil\u00ad as music student Eben Lazarus, 22, and psychology student Hannah Hunt, 23, who are both from Brighton.\\nThe duo forced the evacuation of art lovers, tourists and a class of 11-year-old children on a school trip from the room where the painting hangs after they struck at 2.15pm yesterday.\\nThey attached their own image of 'an apocalyptic vision of the future' of the landscape, on three large sheets of paper, featuring an old car dumped in front of the Mill and the Hay Wain cart carrying an old washing machine.\\nMr Lazarus and Miss Hunt wore white T-shirts with the Just Stop Oil logo, stepped over a rope barrier and then placed the coloured paper on to the front of the painting. Each also placed a hand on the frame of the painting and kneeled beneath it before loudly outlining their concerns as visitors were ushered out by security staff.\\nDuring the protest Mr Lazarus, who described himself as an art lover, said: 'Art is important. It should be held for future generations to see, but when there is no food what use is art. When there is no water, what use is art. When billions of people are in pain and suffering, what use then is art.'\\nThe Hay Wain, which was painted in 1821, is one of the most popular paintings at the gallery and shows a rural Suffolk scene of a wagon returning to the fields across a shallow ford for another load.\\nMr Lazarus said: 'We have stuck a reimagined version of the Hay Wain that demonstrates our road to disaster.'\\nMiss Hunt later added that 'the disruption will end when the UK Government makes a meaningful statement that it will end new oil and gas licences'. She continued: 'I'm here because our government plans to license 40 new UK oil and gas projects in the next few years.\\n'This makes them complicit in pushing the world towards an unliveable climate and in the death of billions of people in the coming decades.\\n'You can forget our 'green and pleasant land' when further oil extraction will lead to widespread crop failures which means we will be fighting for food. Ultimately, new fossil fuels are a death project by our Government.\\n'So yes, there is glue on the frame of this painting but there is blood on the hands of our government.'\\nA spokesman for the National Gallery said the room was closed to the public and police were called. They said later: 'The painting was removed from the wall to be examined by our conservation team.\\n'The Hay Wain suffered minor damage to its frame and there was also some disruption to the surface of the varnish on the painting - both of which have now been successfully dealt with.\\n'The painting will be rehung in Room 34 ready for when the National Gallery opens at 10am on Tuesday.'\\nA Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'At approximately 14.25 on Monday officers were called to a protest taking place inside the National Gallery involving two people. Two people were arrested.'", "image": [["Protestors are removed after running onto the track at the Formula 1 British Grand Prix at Silverstone on Sunday",

Security quickly responded and cleared visitors away before trying to prise the activists off the artwork. Police arrived nearly an hour later and arrested them on suspicion of criminal damage.\\nExtinction Rebellion co-founder Simon Bramwell, 50, of Stroud, Gloucestershire, who is a bushcraft instructor and former builder, was among those involved today.\\nHe was joined by fellow XR activist Caspar Hughes, also 50, of Exeter, Devon, who is a former bike courier and sports events company owner who has also supported Insulate Britain.\\nJust Stop Oil named the three other protesters as 21-year-old Jessica Agar, an art student from Hereford; Tristan Strange, 40, a community organiser from Swindon; and 47-year-old Lucy Porter, a former teacher from Leeds.\\nMs Agar, who has volunteered with the RSPB, and Ms Porter were both involved in a demonstration with XR at Royal Ascot just last month which saw activists shackle themselves to the running rail \u2013 while Ms Agar was also part of an XR protest on Waterloo Bridge three years ago in April 2019 that brought traffic chaos to London.\\nAnd Ms Porter was among a group from XR who used hammers and chisels to smash the windows of a Barclays building in London's Canary Wharf in April 2021 in protest at capitalism fuelling a 'climate catastrophe'.\u00a0She also appealed for funds via JustGiving to help XR protesters who were arrested in the London 2019 demonstrations.\\nMr Strange, an XR supporter from Swindon, was involved in a protest in 2020 that blocked the road outside a print works - and he regularly tweets about environmental issues. Just yesterday, he retweeted a post by Gary Lineker which referenced Sunday's British Grand Prix demonstration where Just Stop Oil supporters sat on the track, saying: 'Way more risk of death with climate change to everyone than there is attempting to delay a motor race.'\\nMr Hughes also appears to be a fan of BBC football pundit Lineker, having retweeted a post by him on June 16 saying: 'Right, I'm done with the wearisome, misinformed climate change deniers. Blocking as many as possible.'\\nCulture Secretary Nadine Dorries blasted the group, tweeting on Tuesday: 'These attention seekers aren't helping anything other than their own selfish egos. Disrupting access to our fabulous cultural assets and putting them at risk of damage is unacceptable. These protestors should be removed and held responsible for the damage and disruption.'\\nThe protesters also sprayed painted the phrase 'no new oil' below the 20ft painting, which depicts the moment when Jesus Christ said one of his 12 apostles would betray him during the last time he ate with them before he was crucified.\\nArts and culture commentator Dr Adrian Hilton, an honorary research fellow at the University of Buckingham and a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, told MailOnline today: 'It's one thing for protestors to paper over or glue themselves to a national treasure like Constable's 'Hay Wain', but it's quite a different plane of offence to violate Leonardo's 'Last Supper', which is a masterpiece of Renaissance religious art revered by Christians all over the world.\\n'When protest extends to desecration of the sacred, the offence becomes intolerable.'\\nDr Matthew Landrus of the University of Oxford, who is one of the world's most respected experts on the work of Leonardo da Vinci, told MailOnline today: 'I wish they would not damage the frame and the wall.'\\nBut he added: 'I think Leonardo would have appreciated the concerns of the climate activists, as well as some of their approaches. He spent most of his life examining the natural world and natural laws, by contrast with the time he contributed to approximately 25-plus paintings.'\\nOther people on social media reacted with fury at the stunt, which came just one day after two other Just Stop Oil activists glued themselves to the frame of John Constable's The Hay Wain at the National Gallery while security guards watched on.\\nOne tweeted: 'Get some proper security - don't know who is the most pathetic, the protesters or the art gallery.' A second said: 'What on earth do they think they will achieve by this? They come across as idiotic vandals and I hope they get jailed'. A third added: 'The UK law is a laughing stock - this would never be tolerated in any other country.'\\nThe action also follows protestors from the group last week gluing themselves to works by JMW Turner, Vincent van Gogh and Horatio McCulloch in London, Glasgow and Manchester to warn against 'a future of suffering'.\\nThe five activists were followed into the Collection Gallery at the Academy by a suspicious security guard, who approached one of his colleagues sitting near the painting. He was overheard warning his colleague about the group - which included a number of photographers - and said: 'Watch them, make sure they don't touch anything.'\\nLess than two minutes later, the protesters glued themselves to the artwork. The guard in the gallery radioed for assistance and he was joined quickly by four more guards. Police were called at 11.37am and arrived at 12.25pm.\\nA Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'At 11.37am on Tuesday, July 5 police were called to Burlington House, Piccadilly following reports that protestors had glued themselves to artwork. Officers attended. Three men and two women were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. They remain in custody.'\\nOne of the protesters on the scene branded the Government as a 'Judas' to future generations as he said the group had brought its campaign to this 'magnificent beautiful painting' because the future is 'bleaker than ever'.\\nJust Stop Oil are calling for the Government to commit to halt new oil and gas licenses in the UK and for the directors, employees and members of art institutions to join their coalition in 'peaceful civil resistance'.\\nThe Royal Academy bought the copy of the painting by Giampietrino - a pupil of Leonardo da Vinci's - for 600 guineas from an 'H. Fraville' in 1821, which was the most expensive work of art they had ever acquired at the time. It also required all the Academicians being called to a general assembly meeting to agree the purchase.\\nA Royal Academy spokesman told MailOnline today: 'Five people have entered the RA's Collection Gallery and glued themselves to the frame of The Last Supper, an early 16th century copy of Leonardo da Vinci's work, attributed to Giampietrino. The protesters have also spray painted 'No New Oil' below the painting in white paint. The room has been closed to the public. The police have been called upon the protestors' request.'\\nThe copy in the Royal Academy was painted around 1520 and is almost the same size as the original - but missing the top third of da Vinci's composition, which is on the wall of the Santa Maria delle Grazie church in Milan.\\nThe value of the London work is not known, but will likely be worth tens of millions of pounds because the original is estimated to be worth at least \u00a3375million ($450million). The only other official copy is located in Switzerland.\\nOne of the protesters at the Royal Academy, Ms Agar, said today: 'No painting is worth more than my six-month old nephew's life. No sculpture can feed babies starving because extreme heat killed food crops.\\n'Nurses are lining up outside food banks, not galleries. If the directors of this gallery really believe that art has the power to change the world then I demand that they claim that power, close and refuse to open until the government commits to no new oil.'\\nMs Agar, who wore an orange Just Stop Oil T-Shirt, added: 'I am an art student but there is no place for me to follow my calling as an artist in a world where I have no future.\\n'In no uncertain terms, the establishment - of which the Royal Academy is a part - has condemned me and all young people to suffer. I am outraged and you should be too.'\\nAnother protester, Ms Porter, said: 'When I was teaching I brought my students to great institutions like the Royal Academy. But now it feels unfair to expect them to respect our culture when their government is hellbent on destroying their future by licensing new oil and gas projects.\\n'We have no time left, to say that we do is a lie. We must halt all new oil and gas right now, we will stop disrupting art institutions as soon as the government makes a meaningful statement to do so. Until then, the disruption will continue so that young people know we are doing all we can for them. There is nothing I would rather be doing.'\\nAnd Mr Strange added: 'I'm terrified for our future. We are heading for a collapse of our food supply and a world in which only the rich can feed themselves comfortably.\\n'Time is running out to change course or prepare for disaster and the message is not reaching the public: there is no free pass, we are all in this together and we must all rise up in civil resistance to force the government to stop new oil and gas.\\n'Da Vinci said that art is the Queen of all sciences communicating knowledge to all the generations of the world. The science still isn't being heard.\\n'We are continually fed comforting lies that downplay the urgency of the climate crisis we face so that fossil fuel interests can continue to reap huge profits whilst the global south and our children are condemned to live in a potential hell.\\n'I call on all artists to harness every ounce of their creativity sounding the alarm in the hope that it cuts through the misinformation. Nothing is more critical at the moment.'\\nThe group were led by Mr Bramwell, who apologised for disrupting other visitors but added: 'The truth is that any new oil expansion is a death sentence for the future.'\\nThe protesters involved in yesterday's action at the National Gallery were named by Just Stop Oil\u00ad as music student Eben Lazarus, 22, and psychology student Hannah Hunt, 23, who are both from Brighton.\\nLeonardo Da Vinci's 'Last Supper' is a late 15th century masterpiece depicting a scene from the Gospel of John, where Jesus Christ announces that one of his Twelve Apostles will betray him.\\nThe artwork hanging at the Royal Academy in London is a copy of that signature work, believed to have been painted by da Vinci's pupil Giampietrino in around 1520.\\nIt shows some details that are no longer visible in the original, including the salt-cellar and the feet of Jesus, according to the Academy's website.\\nThe copy is believed to have been privately owned before being sold to a Carthusian monastery in Pavia, Italy in 1591.\\nIt remained there until 1793 when it was sold. It later appeared in the Brera Academy in Milan before it was again auctioned off in England in 1817.\\nAcademicians from The Royal Academy were summoned before purchasing the copy for six hundred guineas in 1821 - the most expensive piece of work ever purchased for the London collection.\\n\\n\\nThe duo forced the evacuation of art lovers, tourists and a class of 11-year-old children on a school trip from the room where the painting hangs after they struck at 2.15pm yesterday.\\nThey attached their own image of 'an apocalyptic vision of the future' of the landscape, on three large sheets of paper, featuring an old car dumped in front of the Mill and the Hay Wain cart carrying an old washing machine.\\nMr Lazarus and Miss Hunt wore white T-shirts with the Just Stop Oil logo, stepped over a rope barrier and then placed the coloured paper on to the front of the painting.\\nEach also placed a hand on the frame of the painting and kneeled beneath it before loudly outlining their concerns as visitors were ushered out by security staff.\\nDuring the protest Mr Lazarus, who described himself as an art lover, said: 'Art is important. It should be held for future generations to see, but when there is no food what use is art. When there is no water, what use is art. When billions of people are in pain and suffering, what use then is art.'\\nThe Hay Wain, which was painted in 1821, is one of the most popular paintings at the gallery and shows a rural Suffolk scene of a wagon returning to the fields across a shallow ford for another load.\\nMr Lazarus said: 'We have stuck a reimagined version of the Hay Wain that demonstrates our road to disaster.'\\nMiss Hunt later added that 'the disruption will end when the UK Government makes a meaningful statement that it will end new oil and gas licences'. She continued: 'I'm here because our government plans to license 40 new UK oil and gas projects in the next few years.\\n'This makes them complicit in pushing the world towards an unliveable climate and in the death of billions of people in the coming decades.\\n'You can forget our 'green and pleasant land' when further oil extraction will lead to widespread crop failures which means we will be fighting for food. Ultimately, new fossil fuels are a death project by our Government.\\n'So yes, there is glue on the frame of this painting but there is blood on the hands of our government.'\\nA spokesman for the National Gallery said the room was closed to the public and police were called. They said later: 'The painting was removed from the wall to be examined by our conservation team.\\n'The Hay Wain suffered minor damage to its frame and there was also some disruption to the surface of the varnish on the painting - both of which have now been successfully dealt with.\\n'The painting will be rehung in Room 34 ready for when the National Gallery opens at 10am on Tuesday.'\\nA Metropolitan Police spokesman added: 'At approximately 14.25 on Monday officers were called to a protest taking place inside the National Gallery involving two people. Two people were arrested.'\\nIn the last week, Just Stop Oil activists have allegedly attached themselves to a 19th-century landscape by Horatio McCulloch called My Heart's In The Highlands which hangs in Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum.\\nThey are also alleged to have sprayed the group's logo on the walls and floor of the renowned gallery in orange paint.\\nThey have also attached themselves to Vincent Van Gogh's 1889 work Peach Trees in Blossom at The Courtauld gallery in London.\\nAnother alleged target has been a JMW Turner painting at Manchester Art Gallery.\\nBy Martin Robinson, Chief Reporter for MailOnline\\nFuel protesters who brought motorways including the M4 to a standstill yesterday are plotting to shut down London at the end of the month and 'gridlock the whole city' in the battle to convince\u00a0Boris Johnson to cut the price of petrol and diesel, MailOnline can reveal today.\\nFuel Price Stand Against Tax (FPSAT) plan to meet in Parliament Square at Midday on Friday July 22, after driving slowly through the capital during\u00a0the morning rush hour amid fears 'go slow' protests could escalate dramatically this summer.\\nIt came as Priti Patel\u00a0urged police to take a 'zero tolerance' approach and use tough new powers to stop them and said officers should arrest and charge the drivers.\\nThe maximum penalty for 'wilful obstruction of a highway' was recently increased to six months in jail and an unlimited fine.\u00a0Previously the offence carried only a low fine of around \u00a3100 to \u00a3150, which many eco protesters have faced, in a string of cases where one sentencing judge even praised their commitment to green issues.\\nOn one occasion a police officer was filmed telling\u00a0Insulate Britain\u00a0fanatics to 'just be careful' because 'I don't want to put good people in a cell' having offered them 'another 10 minutes' to block a road in Birmingham. Yet yesterday fair fuel activists were surrounded by as many as 100 police officers, arrested and had their vehicles towed.\\nOne FPSAT member told MailOnline: 'Priti Patel is going for us - but all we want is a fair deal on fuel so we can do our jobs. Look at how the climate change protesters have been treated. They cause chaos, are arrested and then released on bail the next day to do it all over again'.\\nCritics have blasted the 'soft touch' approach police have taken against climate activists who in some cases have been arrested dozens of times in recent months only to pop up again to shut\u00a0down roads, oil refineries and even glue themselves to British national treasures such at Constable's The Hay Wain at the National Gallery yesterday and a\u00a0copy of Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper at the Royal Academy of Arts in London today.\\nOn Sunday a mob stormed the British Grand Prix at Silverstone in an act Martin Brundle claimed could have seen them 'sliced into 100 pieces' or kill a driver, fan or race marshal. Six people were charged today including Just Stop Oil ringleader\u00a0Louis McKechnie, a John Lennon lookalike who has already been arrested 20 times.\\nYesterday 12 drivers were arrested on the M4 travelling slowly between England and Wales and another driver was arrested close to the A38 near Bristol. There were also delays the A92 in Scotland, the M5 in Devon, the M32, the M180 in Lincolnshire and the A64 near York. After the\u00a0protests yesterday, a petition to slash fuel duty as a litre of diesel and unleaded hits \u00a32 a litre has blasted\u00a0through the 300,000 barrier.\\nA post on the FPSAT Facebook page, seen by MailOnline, says that on Friday July 22 supporters should 'meet your mates, congregate at Parliament Square, drive as slow as you can, gridlock the whole city, bring it to its knees, aim is to stay and not move until we get action'.\\nYesterday activists were surrounded by as many as 100 police officers with around a dozen arrested on suspicion of driving at 10mph - less than the 30mph which had been agreed in advance. The Government is said to fear the\u00a0slow-moving convoys on major routes could become regular and see the start of a new movement akin to the gilets jaunes across the Channel, where working class\u00a0protesters wearing yellow vests shut down France over economic problems.\\nAs Britain faces a summer of discontent, it also emerged today:\\nLouis McKechnie, a John Lennon lookalike ringleader of the Just Stop Oil movement,\u00a0has already been arrested 20 times because of his professional protesting. But despite his many brushes with the law his most recent punishment was a \u00a3150 fine\u00a0for wilfully obstructing a highway in central London.\\nJust Stop Oil damaged Constable's masterpiece The Hay Wain in their latest stunt as MailOnline can reveal that one of\u00a0the eco-vandals arrested\u00a0at the National Gallery is a hypocrite yachtswoman who has\u00a0racked up tens of thousands of carbon-belching air miles travelling the globe while lecturing on climate change.\\nBrighton\u00a0students Hannah Hunt, 23, and Eben Lazarus, 22,\u00a0were held after sticking large sheets of paper over the 200-year-old painting's Suffolk landscape, replacing it with a scene of scorched trees, polluted skies, and discarded household waste - and then gluing their hands to the frame.\\nHunt and Lazarus lectured the public on fossil fuels being a 'death project' and warning of the 'total collapse of society' yesterday, but Miss Hunt previously admitted she 'impulse flew to the Canaries to escape chilly British weather', MailOnline can reveal.\\nA spokesman for the National Gallery, confirmed the painting had been damaged, and said: 'Police attended and removed the protestors at around 4.40pm, and they were then arrested. The painting was removed from the wall to be examined by our Conservation team. The Hay Wain suffered minor damage to its frame and there was also some disruption to the surface of the varnish on the painting - both of which have now been successfully dealt with'.\\nThe painting, considered John\u00a0Constable's greatest work and a 'national treasure', will be rehung today. While its cultural value to the nation is priceless,\u00a0the record price for a Constable at auction was \u00a322.5million for The Lock ten years ago.\\nBut it was the target of another attack by Just Stop Oil, who have recently moved from disrupting football matches and shutting down oil refineries to attacking pieces of art.\\nMcKechnie's partner in crime at an oil refinery protest this year, Matthew Powell, was fined \u00a3127 after he admitted aggravated trespass on April 10 at Exolum Storage Ltd.\\nBiff Whipster, 54, admitted criminal damage after leaving a 'hard, crusty layer of glue' on the window of a police vehicle, in a case where the judge praised his commitment to greener living despite him and his friends disrupting the journeys of 18,000 drivers on the M25.\\nCatherine Maclean was charged with aggravated trespass after an incident at an oil terminal in Thurrock in April. She was fined just \u00a3400 despite action that saw some petrol stations run low on fuel.\\nConservative MP Robert Halfon called for Chancellor Rishi Sunak to go further than the 5p per litre reduction in fuel duty implemented in March's Spring Statement, and said the growing wave of anger should not be ignored.\\n'I don't want anything that disrupts people in their ordinary lives,' he said. 'But I'm worried that this is a precursor to even more protests that are going to spread around the UK.\\n'If we're not careful, we're going to have a Canadian-style situation, with truck drivers descending on Parliament.'\\nAmong those taking part in the Fuel Price Stand Against Tax protest yesterday was welder Richard Dite, who risked six points on his driving licence and a \u00a3200 fine by filming the convoy on his mobile phone from the wheel of his van.\\nShouting 'give us our country back', the 44-year-old was among about half a dozen vehicles in a small procession - admitting it was 'not a very good turnout'.\\nHe drives 30 miles from Maesteg to Cardiff for work daily, and said the cost is now 'upwards of \u00a3300' a week, having been around '\u00a3125 before the price increases'. 'I am on the verge of putting my gear in the shed,' he said, adding: 'I would be better off on the dole. That's not me. I am a worker. Something's got to happen.'\\nMartin Crowley, 48, from Cardiff, said he is a self-employed exotic animal courier and fuel prices are damaging his livelihood. 'Fuel cost me \u00a3280 over two days last week. It's unbelievable,' he said. 'You can hardly make a living anymore.'\\nAlso taking part was Vicky Stamper, 41, a former HGV driver from Cwmbran, South Wales, said: 'We had to leave those jobs because it was costing us \u00a3380 a week just to get to and from work'.\\nFarmer Andrew Spence, who targeted a Shell plant at Jarrow, South Tyneside, in demonstrations when Tony Blair was prime minister 22 years ago, claimed yesterday's action was 'just the start of things to come'.\\n'We're promising a summer of discontent - this is only going to get bigger and bigger,' he said.\\nMr Spence, 55, from County Durham, said the advent of sites such as Facebook had transformed his ability to mobilise people angered by rising fuel prices.\\n'Social media is what makes people stand up and take notice,' he said. 'That's something we didn't have in the early 2000s.'\\nMr Spence said blockades of refineries had 'not been ruled out', adding: 'We're promising a summer of discontent - this is only going to get bigger and bigger.' He is planning a protest in Newcastle.\\nPriti Patel last night urged police to use tough new powers to stop fuel protesters bringing Britain's roads to a halt.\\nAt the time of publishing, the average price of petrol has hit at an all-time high, which has been an almost daily occurrence in the last few weeks.\\nDiesel also isn't far short of its steepest price on record.\\nOn Sunday 3 July, the UK average for petrol hit a new record 191.53p a litre, while diesel hung on to record levels at 199.03p a litre - just a fraction short of the all-time high of 199.07p set on Friday 1 July.\\n\\nWhat motorists pay at the pumps is determined by a number of factors that make-up the overall price of petrol and diesel. However, the single biggest influence is the price of crude oil.\\nThis had a major impact on what is charged for 'wholesale' petrol and diesel - the price paid by fuel companies.\\nExperts from the AA and RAC have repeatedly accused the industry of 'rocket and feather pricing': quickly passing rising wholesale prices onto consumers but not cutting them as urgently when the fall.\\n\\nAnd other factors are also at play when it comes to the price of petrol and diesel.\\nThis includes the cost of biofuel content used in the manufacturing of both fuel types that is designed to make them more environmentally friendly.\\n\\n\\nAlso adding to the pump price calculation is the cost of transporting the fuel, retailer profit margins and last - but no means least - taxation.\\nIn fact, petrol and diesel is taxed twice in the UK: the first is fuel duty of 52.59p paid on every litre of fuel, which is then also taxed at 20 per cent for VAT.\\nIt means over 40 per cent of what drivers currently pay at the pump is taxation.\\nCast your mind back 12 months and the price of petrol and diesel was 130.5p-a-litre and\u00a0133p respectively at the start of July 2021. But prices were on the brink of a rise.\\nThe combination of a fuel supply crisis, panic buying and rising oil meant petrol and diesel prices in October had eclipsed previous record highs that had existed since April 2012.\\nBut it was the outbreak of war in Ukraine in February that triggered the cost of filling up to skyrocket.\\nRussia is one of the world's largest oil exporters, but the fallout from its invasion of Ukraine has resulted in sanctions on Russian products.\\n\\nThe RAC says the price of petrol in particular should already be much lower than what it currently is after five weeks of decline wholesale prices.\\nSimon Williams, the motoring organisation's fuel price expert, says major supermarkets are playing a key role in keeping costs high by failing to make reductions when they can.\\n'The average cost of delivered unleaded was 145.7p a litre last week which after adding 7p a litre retailer margin and 20 per cent VAT produces a price of 183p,' explains Williams.\\n'Despite this the big four supermarkets, which dominate fuel sales, are standing firm with a litre of petrol at their stores costing an average of 190.19p.\\n'We would love to hear their reasoning for keeping their prices so high in this instance, but we've never known them publicly defend themselves.\\n'Far too often it's the smallest retailers, who sell far less fuel combined despite having more forecourts, that stand up for the industry.'\\nThe AA's Luke Bosdet says it is 'very hard' to understand why forecourts aren't bringing down prices.\\n'Perhaps it's supermarkets using higher fuel costs to pay for their 'Aldi-matching' offers, and then local oil company-branded sites feeling no pressure to bring down their prices,' he told This is Money.\\n'Maybe it's a carbon copy of what happened in the run-up to the 23 March fuel duty cut [read about this below]: wholesale prices had been falling but the fuel trade kept piling on increases at the pump, in the expectation that the Government would fork out the savings though a duty cut.\\n'Or, perhaps, it's because fuel customers have stopped buying sweets and coffee when they go to pay for their petrol and diesel \u2026 which is why a pump price cut might entice them to resume those habits.\\n'Our concern is that, because petrol demand is still 94 per cent of what it would normally be, both the supermarket and non-supermarket sites think that most of their customers can take the hit.\\n'That means they are taking us for fools.'\\nDespite experts thinking fuel prices should already be lower, there could be another huge spike in the coming weeks, according to recent reports.\\nFinancial experts predict that global oil prices could hit an eye-wateringly high of $380 a barrel if Vladimir Putin responds to war-related sanctions by restricting Russia's crude oil output further.\\nAnalysts fear a 'stratospheric' rise that would see oil prices almost quadruple - and that would easily push pump prices well over \u00a32 per litre and have a devastating ripple effect for global markets.\\n\\nOn 23 March, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced an immediate reducing in fuel duty by 5p a litre to stave the record cost of filling up at the time.\\nThe cut to taxation on every litre of petrol and diesel means it went from 57.95p to 52.95p, and it will remain like that until March 2023.\\nHowever, just eight weeks after the cuts were put in place, the UK average price of unleaded had risen back to record levels (above 167.30p) - and has continued to climb ever since.\\nThe RAC says it has been\u00a0'lobbying the Government for months' to take further action to ease the financial burden caused by record pump prices.\\nThe motoring group has called for a further cut to duty or to VAT to 'help hard-pressed drivers and businesses'.\\nThe AA adds that any cut in the pump price of fuel would be a 'first sign of relief for families grappling with the cost of living crisis' and said the fuel trade is depriving them of that.\\nSuch is the scale of public discontent with fuel prices that protesters have this week taken the roads as part of an organised call to force the Government to take further action to reduce the cost of filling up.\\nThere are things you can do to extend the time between visits to forecourts - if you're willing to change how you drive and prepare your vehicle to be as economical as possible.\\nUsing really simple eco-driving techniques 'can easily save the equivalent of 9p-a-litre', says the AA.\\nFor motorists desperately wanting to get the most out of the expensive fuel they are currently pumping into their car's tank, This is Money has compiled our top 10 best tips to drive as efficiently as possible.\\n\\nHer broadside came as a Tory MP warned that rising anger at the soaring price of filling up could see Canadian-style 'Freedom Convoy' blockades targeting London. A veteran of the fuel protests that paralysed Britain in 2000 is helping to co-ordinate what organisers hope will be a 'summer of discontent'.\\nDemonstrators who cause disruption on the roads risk stiffer punishments under measures that came into force earlier this year.\\nThey were designed to combat protests by groups such as Extinction Rebellion but would also apply to the fuel campaigners.\\nA Home Office source said last night: 'Through our Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act, we have given the police a wealth\u00a0of powers to deal with disruptive and damaging protests, including imprisonment and unlimited fines for those blocking a highway - actions which inflict further pain on those affected by rising prices.\\n'The Home Secretary would encourage and support the police to make use of all the powers available to them. Forces need to move people on.\\n'These protests are blocking people from getting to work and from carrying out other vital journeys - this is not about whether you believe in the cause or not.'\\nThousands of motorists experienced lengthy delays yesterday after protestors formed go-slow convoys on major routes, demanding an immediate cut in fuel duty.\\nIn a campaign organised on social media, drivers descended on agreed gathering points early yesterday morning, with the Prince of Wales Bridge between England and South Wales closed both ways.\\nIt prompted Bristol Airport to advise travellers to allow extra time for their journeys.\\nThe M54 in Shropshire and M62 in West Yorkshire were also disrupted by separate protest convoys, with a Tesco petrol station in Shepton Mallet, Somerset, also targeted.\\nCanada's so-called Freedom Convoy in February escalated from anger at Covid vaccine rules into a wider campaign against prime minister Justin Trudeau's policies, leading to a three-week occupation of the capital, Ottawa.\\nBy driving so slowly, they risked disrupting emergency services thereby 'posing a risk to local communities', Chief Superintendent Tom Harding of Gwent Police said.\\nSome motorists caught up in yesterday's disruption slammed the protesters for making the situation even worse.\\nOne van driver said he was 'very annoyed' by the rolling road block. 'They're just wasting time,' he told Sky News. 'It's a pain in the backside - ridiculous.'\\nAmong the groups understood to have helped organise yesterday's '4th of July protest day' is a Facebook-based campaign called Fuel Price Stand Against Tax.\\nIt appears to have been started by a mechanic from Falkirk in Scotland and had almost 51,000 members yesterday.\\nDiscussing trying to cripple refineries last month, the group's organiser called on members to 'block off and shut down' the plants.\\nThe protests come at a time when fuel duty and VAT currently make up 85p of the current average \u00a31.91 for a litre of unleaded petrol, according to the RAC.\\nThe recent wave of price hikes has been driven by global oil supply issues after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the average price of a litre of diesel at UK forecourts now as high as 199.1p.\\nMr Sunak has said he will carefully consider calls for a 'more substantial' fuel duty cut after the 5p per litre reduction implemented in March failed to halt price rises.\\nBacking the protests although he was not involved in them, Howard Cox, of Fair Fuel UK, which wants a cut of at least 20p in fuel duty, said pump prices were 'crippling' businesses and livelihoods.\\n'I do support them if they are lawful and do not interfere with emergency services,' he told Sky News.\\nThe Government said that while it understands people are struggling with rising prices and have a right to protest, 'people's day-to-day lives should not be disrupted' and warned that traffic delays 'will only add to fuel use'.\\nJust Stop Oil damaged Constable's masterpiece The Hay Wain in their latest stunt as MailOnline can reveal that one of\u00a0the eco-vandals arrested\u00a0at the National Gallery is a hypocrite yachtswoman who has\u00a0racked up tens of thousands of carbon-belching air miles travelling the globe while lecturing on climate change.\\nBrighton\u00a0students Hannah Hunt, 23, and Eben Lazarus, 22,\u00a0were held after sticking large sheets of paper over the 200-year-old painting's Suffolk landscape, replacing it with a scene of scorched trees, polluted skies, and discarded household waste - and then gluing their hands to the frame.\\nHunt and Lazarus lectured the public on fossil fuels being a 'death project' and warning of the 'total collapse of society' yesterday, but Miss Hunt previously admitted she 'impulse flew to the Canaries to escape chilly British weather', MailOnline can reveal.\\nA spokesman for the National Gallery, confirmed the painting had been damaged, and said: 'Police attended and removed the protestors at around 4.40pm, and they were then arrested.

They were swiftly dragged away by marshals to cheers from the watching crowd.\\nNorthamptonshire Police said David Baldwin, 46, of Stonesfield, Witney, Oxfordshire, Emily Brocklebank, 24, of Yeadon, Leeds, Alasdair Gibson, 21, of no fixed address, Louis McKechnie, 21, of London, Bethany Mogie, 40, of St Albans, Hertfordshire, and Joshua Smith, 28, of Manchester, have all been charged with conspiracy to cause public nuisance.\\nAll six will appear at Northampton Magistrates' Court this morning. The force said a 43-year-old man also arrested in connection with the incident has been released under investigation pending further inquiries.\\nThe Brighton-based activist, from Cumbria, who studies at Sussex University, said after protests she enjoys 'a weird, dreamy, calm mindset' she finds empowering.\\nHer father runs an environmental consultancy firm and her family purchased an early 20th century property on the west coast of Scotland that\u00a0has one of the lowest possible energy efficiency available.\\nHeating and lighting the home results in approximately 12 tonnes of carbon dioxide being put back into the atmosphere, which is double Scotland's average according to the national register for Energy Performance Certificates.\\nThe family also own a five-bedroom home near Kendal, Cumbria.\\nMiss Hunt is one of several middle-class campaigners who have been holding Britain's motorists to ransom throughout this year.\\nTheir protests continued in April when activists climbed onto lorries at the Grays depot.

They got stuck in traffic in Kent at 2.30am and did not board a Channel Tunnel train until 11.15am.\\n'It's a bit of a free-for-all now as there are so many delays there is no real way of tracking who's getting on what train,' she told The Mail on Sunday as they drove on to the train. 'This is our first holiday since pre-Covid, so we are desperate to get there.'\\nRea Pope, a science teacher from Reigate, Surrey, was stranded in the queue outside Eurotunnel's terminal in Folkestone for more than six hours \u2013 with traffic taking 90 minutes to crawl just 100 yards. 'We arrived in the traffic one mile away at 5am and we are still stuck in it,' she wrote on Twitter just before 11am.\\nCaroline Lynsey left her home in Cambridge at 3am but did not reach the passport booths at the Eurotunnel terminal until around midday \u2013 nine hours later. She estimated it had taken seven hours to travel just three miles. 'Seriously, don't bother coming near here today, change your tickets,' she wrote in a post on Facebook.\\nPassengers waiting for flights at Manchester Airport were yesterday forced to queue in the rain outside terminal buildings.\\nA combination of staff shortages and the summer exodus left frustrated holidaymakers in queues that snaked through car parks.\\nAround 50,000 passengers a day are expected to travel through Manchester Airport this summer with passengers warned to expect waits of more than an hour to get through security.\\nOne exasperated passenger tweeted on Friday night: 'Complete disgrace at Manchester Airport. Lack of info and excessive delays. 18.30 Belfast still not called but the 20.00 to Belfast now boarding \u2013 ridiculous doesn't even come close.'\\nJennifer Byrne-Smith, Head of Operations Hub at Manchester Airport, said: 'We've welcomed 500 extra security staff this year. We haven't cancelled any of our flight schedules so that really helps. We're committed to getting people on their way.' Meanwhile, airline customers are still facing last-minute cancellations. Amanda Armstrong, 56, from Bournemouth, was due to fly from Gatwick to Milan on Friday with relatives. But in the early hours, she received an email from easyJet saying the flight was cancelled.\\nAfter eventually managing to book replacement flights to Verona with British Airways, costing \u00a3450 per ticket, she said: 'Apart from the stress, the cancellation of a flight three hours before check-in with no explanation is beyond acceptable.'\\nJohn Keefe, of Eurotunnel, said the chaos near Folkestone had largely been caused by a serious accident on the M20 on Friday morning, which meant no traffic entered the terminal for three hours. A huge queue of lorries also formed because of chaos at Dover.\\nAbout 3,000 lorries remained parked on the M20 yesterday, forcing holidaymakers with Eurotunnel bookings to use a single lane of the A20. A queue of lorries and cars became gridlocked at Castle Hill roundabout near the terminal. 'That part of the journey is taking a very long time,' Mr Keefe said. 'Once in the terminal, everything is fine.'\\nFor a second consecutive day, people trying to travel by ferry from Dover suffered long delays. P&O Ferries urged travellers to allow three to four hours to get there and clear security checks. The fiasco began early on Friday when French border officials operated just six of their 12 booths at Dover. All of the booths were manned yesterday.\\nAmong those affected were pensioners Paul and Wendy Nicholas who were heading to Cologne to join a river cruise. They got to the port by train but the coach they had to catch got caught in a huge traffic jam 18 miles outside Dover. 'We've no idea when the coach is going to get here,' said Mr Nicholas, a former assistant chief constable. 'It's been a disaster.'\\nTheir misery came after a French politician blamed Brexit for the delays. Pierre-Henri Dumont, a Republican MP for Calais, claimed that the British Government rejected a proposal to double the number of passport booths for French police at Dover a few months ago. 'No need to blame French authorities for the traffic jams in Dover, that's an aftermath of Brexit,' Mr Dumont tweeted.\\nLast night British Government sources dismissed the claim, insisting that it was shortage of French staff \u2013 not lack of passport booths \u2013 that was the problem. A source said: 'Additional booths were installed ahead of the weekend but have not been fully utilised.'\\nHaving initially been critical of the French, Doug Bannister, chief executive of the Port of Dover, suddenly changed tack yesterday to blame post-Brexit passport rules.\\nPensioners Paul and Wendy Nicholas, who are travelling to Cologne for a river cruise, said it's been a 'disaster' while NHS worker Cathy Finnis said she had abandoned her trip altogether.\\nTaking to Twitter to warn other travellers, Ms Finnis wrote: 'Le Shuttle customers please be aware that the queue is horrendous! We finally gave up after 5.5 hours of waiting on #m20 not even entrance! says additional processing time 6h. It's not just the Port of Dover.'\\nThe Nicholases left their home in Brockenhurst, Hampshire, and got a private taxi to the Holiday Inn, in Folkestone, Kent, where they were meant to join a coach taking them to the port.\\nHowever, they were unable to reach the town due to the motorway closures, leaving them stranded with their luggage.\\nPaul said: 'The journey went superbly until we were just two miles from the Holiday Inn in Folkestone.It was absolutely chock-a-block. We tried some country roads and they were all solidly blocked.'\\nThey were forced to get on a train from nearby Sandling to Folkestone West to try and join the coach trip.\\nPaul, 76, added: 'By 10am - bearing in mind the coach had left the hotel at 8:30am - it had only moved 200 yards.'\\nThe former Assistant Chief Constable and his wife, 68, then made the decision to get on a train to Dover Priory to meet the coach at the port.\\nBut by 2pm they were still sat waiting at the terminal, having missed two ferries, as the bus had barely moved.\\nPaul said: 'At this point it was still 18 miles away and had moved just 800 yards in four hours.\\n'We've no idea when the coach is going to get here and we've no idea how long it'll take us to get to Cologne to join the ship for the river cruise, which is meant to be departing at 5.15pm. It's been a disaster.'\\nRetired probation officer Wendy said: 'They can't even tell us what time we'll get there because it's just gridlocked.'\\nThe couple said the trip was their first to Europe in 'many years' but they are adamant they won't be returning now.\\nPaul added: 'We'll get there eventually but it's spoilt it for the moment which is a shame. We shan't do it again.'\\nAccording to Paul and Wendy, 150 people were due to join the seven-night cruise - most of whom are still stranded on the coach in Folkestone.\\nWendy said: 'I just feel sorry for the people who are still on the coach because they're all old people. They've been stuck there for five hours with no toilet or anything.'\\nThe pensioners still face a four hour drive to Cologne once they've reached Calais - but they aren't hopeful they'll reach their destination tonight.\\n68-year-old Wendy added: 'There's always the option of just going home and sitting in the garden with a Pimms I suppose. We'll just put an Andre Rieu video on or something.'\\nPaul, who voted for Brexit, believes the chaos at the port yesterday and today has been caused by 'less than generous relations with the French' after the UK left the EU.\\nHe added: 'This volume of people is normal for Dover - they've coped with it before - so something must be different. I can only think there's a bit more formality now than there used to be. I suppose this has been the first big test for the Port of Dover since Brexit - because COVID stopped people travelling.'\\nAnnette Culshaw and her husband Robert left Westgate at 5am, hoping to avoid congestion but they were still stuck in traffic at 2pm. The pair, who used to live in France several years ago, described the situation as 'horrible'.\\n'We left home at 5am to try and get here before the queues, it took us an hour to get here and we've been queuing ever since, we can't understand why there's so little movement. We're just at a standstill.\\n'We've been sitting in traffic for seven and a half hours,' Annette said. 'Nothing's happening at all. We're moving about one car length every 45 minutes. We're still on the M20 and we still haven't reached junction 12 to exit the Eurotunnel.\\n'There are two lanes of traffic. The outside lane is trying to cut in all the time to the inside lane, so we're just not moving. There are no toilets, nothing. It's horrible, and of course it's so hot with the weather.\\n'We took some water with us and we're going through that quite rapidly. But we have got water and we have got biscuity-type things if we need it. It's just the heat and the frustration. It's so frustrating.'\\nThe couple did not have a clue about what was happening in Dover when they left Westgate this morning.\\n'We're okay because we're a couple. There are cars with two, three or four children, babies, or dogs and it's just awful. We don't understand why it's happening, I guess that's the big issue for us,' Annette said.\\nShe claims they have not heard from Eurotunnel all day apart from an email they received earlier on Saturday. She said: 'We got an email from Eurotunnel just saying 'we're operating as normally, there'll be maybe a short delay before you're booked in'. That is all we know, we've had no information from them at all, we don't even know if we're going to get onto the train at all tonight.'\\nDoug Bannister, chief executive of the Port of Dover, said the increased checks at the border that have come with Brexit are the blame for 'increased transaction times' that have caused huge tailbacks into the port over the last couple of days.\\nIt comes after he claimed yesterday the port had been 'let down' by French border control staff after some passport booths were left empty on Thursday and Friday.\\nMr Bannister added the port had tried to prepare by creating 'more border capacity', but that travellers should expect some delays.\\nThat will come as little comfort to the thousands of holidaymakers stuck in traffic yesterday and today as they try to get their summer break underway.\\nMany people reported delays of up to seven hours as they tried to get into the port and onto ferries yesterday, while one unnamed man told the BBC he had been there for '30 hours' trying to make the crossing.\\nThere were also delays for people trying to get to the Eurotunnel at Folkestone, with one motorist claiming there were 'at least two miles of queues by 7am' this morning, and that one worker warned them waits of 'eight hours' could be possible.\\nIt is reported that while French border control staff have turned up today, they will have clear a backlog of traffic, including people who have slept in their vehicles overnight.\\nMr Bannister said it was 'let down' by poor resourcing at the French border on Friday and this was 'immensely frustrating'.\\nSpeaking this morning on the BBC Radio 4 Today Show, he appeared to back away from those comments, and instead blamed Brexit.\\n'We are operating in a post-Brexit environment which does mean that passports need to be checked, they need to be stamped and indeed the capable people that do man the booths, Police Aux Frontieres, they're doing their job that they need to do now,' he said.\\nWhile French officials have blamed the increase in the number of checks needed after Brexit for delays yesterday and today, staff at the Port of Dover say that's not the case.\\nOfficials at the port claim they have done all they can to help their French counterparts, including building three new passport booths to bring the total to ten.\\nBut they say they were shocked to find out the 'completely and utterly inadequate' staffing levels Police Aux Frontieres (PAF) were planning to use this weekend.\\nOne source told the Telegraph the French 'just haven't turned up'.\\nThey said French border officials have the option to reduce the number of checks they make at each vehicle if they want, but 'they are crossing every 'i' and dotting every 't''.\\nThey said: 'They [the French] are doing everything they can, it would appear, to make it difficult, which is why everyone is so frustrated.'\\nThe Telegraph added that more staff were called in to help later in the day, but because they travelled in on the Eurostar instead of the ferry, they were caught up in traffic on the M20.\\nIt wasn't just people trying to make the crossing who were caught up in the traffic, with locals who live near to the A20 approaching the port saying gridlock is now a regular occurrence.\\nJamie, who lives in a house on the A20, said it was like having 'Glastonbury outside your house six times a year'.\\nHe said the port had 'created more border capacity so that the overall throughput can be maintained' and that while their modelling had shown some 'very peak busy days during the summer season' are expected, 'for the most part we should be able to cope with the traffic'.\\nHowever, this was disputed by\u00a0Natalie Elphicke, Conservative MP for Dover, told Sky News this morning: 'It was a dreadful start to that summer getaway yesterday and an appalling situation for residents in Dover too. There simply weren't enough French border police.\\n'Today I am hearing the French workers have turned up and they are expected to be manning the booths at capacity but there will be a knock-on effect as there always is when there is an issue that has happened at the ports.\\n'We are expecting long, long delays today, traffic has already been building up around the town and it is going to be a very serious situation on the roads again in Kent today.'\\nAnd writing in the Express the MP called on France to apologise for the disruption of the last two days.\\nShe wrote: 'What is particularly maddening is that efforts to stop this very situation from happening had been going on for weeks prior.\\n'The Port of Dover, the Kent Resilience Forum and the Department for Transport had prepared carefully so that the summer getaway peak weekend went without a hitch.\\n'Yet despite all the preparations, the French let us down badly. Ruining the start of family holidays is not something that can simply be dismissed with a Gallic shrug.\\n'France should apologise to Dover residents and the travellers who have suffered real misery on Kent's roads, not make up excuses for letting everyone down.'\\nNick Thomas-Symonds, Labour's shadow secretary of state for international trade, accused the Government of being 'absent' during the chaos in Kent.\\nSpeaking on Times Radio, he said: 'What we really do need to see is a Government that is taking a grip of this situation.\\n'The Government has not been planning in advance. We were urging the Government, for example, some months ago to negotiate a veterinary agreement to reduce the number of checks. The Government has not done that, has not put the planning in place and yet again, we have a crisis where the Government is absent.'\\nHe also hit out at Tory leadership candidates, telling the programme: 'They're now contained once again, in their own infighting whilst we have something like this critical incident we've been discussing in Dover where their focus is elsewhere.'\\nThere are also issues at Folkestone, with people queuing for hours to board trains at the Eurotunnel. Some people even slept in their cars, with photos on social media showing people walking amongst the gridlocked vehicles in the middle of the night.\\nMotorist Sian Sturgis, who is waiting to get on to a train at the Eurotunnel, said traffic had moved just 100 metres in two hours this morning.\\nPhotos from the queue even show families playing badminton in the traffic jams as they wait.\\nToday Port of Dover officials said French border staff have been 'fully mobilised' to clear the backlog of freight traffic and cars.\\nIt is understood all 10 of the French passport booths are being manned today, as are five additional booths.\\nIn a statement the Port of Dover said: 'The Port of Dover is relieved that French border staff (Police Aux Frontieres) have been fully mobilised at French border controls in Dover (known as 'juxtaposed controls') on Saturday morning in order to get holidaymakers and freight vehicles moving and to relieve the disruption on the Dover and wider Kent community.\\n'There is of course a way to go to clear the backlog of waiting passengers, some of whom have had more extensive delays due to a serious incident yesterday on the M20.\\n'Our thoughts are with those who were caught up in the incident, both directly and indirectly as a result of the additional disruption. We will, together with our ferry operators, support the efforts of all partners to get people on their way as quickly as possible.\\n'Today is going to be very busy, with more UK tourists heading to Dover in order to travel to France. Passengers should keep in touch with their ferry operators for the latest information on their sailings.'\\nIt was not just holidaymakers stuck in the traffic, with at least 3,000 lorries currently parked up on the M20 waiting to head to the port and the Channel Tunnel as part of Operation Brock - the traffic management system that deals with freight.\\nNational Highways has announced it will close the M20 coast bound between J8-9 to all traffic so lorries will have somewhere to park, reducing disruption to other road users and other roads in Kent.\\nAnd residents near Folkestone complained this morning the gridlock meant they were physically unable to leave their village in their cars.\\nAS Roberts tweeted: 'I don't often get on my soapbox but this is crazy. We live near Folkestone Kent and can't get out of our village\u2026 not one member of Kent Police\u00a0in sight to help! And all these poor people waiting to go on holiday.'\\nThis is the first weekend of what is expected to be the busiest school break in nearly a decade as families look to make the most of the holidays after two Covid-hit years.\\nThe RAC said an estimated 18.8million leisure trips were planned in the UK between Friday and Monday - the most since it began tracking summer getaway numbers in 2014.\\nWhile airports have seen months of travel chaos due to staffing shortages following the pandemic, the start of the summer holidays has seen Dover become embroiled in this too, with miles of tailbacks into the port.\\nIt has sparked a bitter row between the UK and France, with both sides essentially blaming the other for the delays.\\nUK officials have blamed a lack of French border security staff, with claims that of the 14 workers expected to turn up to passport booths yesterday, only six turned up on time.\\nFrench officials said an\u00a0'unforeseeable technical incident' in the Channel Tunnel meant that the staffing of border control booths had to be pushed back from 8.30am to 9.45am on Friday morning.\\nBut Eurotunnel's Director of Public Affairs John Keefe told the BBC that the Tunnel incident had 'absolutely nothing to do with problems at the Port of Dover', adding that issues had actually started at the port on Thursday.\\nNow Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who is fighting to become the next Prime Minister in the Conservative leadership campaign, has waded into the row, saying it was an 'awful' but 'entirely avoidable' situation. '\\nSpeaking yesterday, she said: 'We need action from France to build up capacity at the border to limit any further disruption for British tourists and to ensure this appalling situation is avoided in future. We will be working with the French authorities to find a solution.'\\nHowever, Pierre-Henri Dumont, Republican MP for Calais, wrote on Twitter: 'No need to blame French authorities for the traffic jams in Dover: that's an aftermath of Brexit. We have to run more and longer checks.\\n'The British government rejected few months ago a proposal to double the number of passport booths given to the French Police in Dover.'\\nBut the port said the number of booths had been increased from six to nine ahead of the summer rush, and these became operational this week. It added that they were available for use, but PAF haven't always manned all nine of them.\\nThe war of words will come as little comfort to those stuck in the jams for hours on end yesterday as they struggled to get their summer breaks on the continent started.\\nSpeaking to the BBC, brothers Ben and Eric Janousek said they had set off from Tunbridge Wells in Kent at 5am yesterday and still had to wait 'seven or eight hours to get on a boat' at the port.\\nThey added that were frustrated by a lack of information about how long the delay was going to be.\\nMatters were not helped for many travellers as the M20 was closed in both directions last night after a crash involving a van and a lorry.\\nThe driver of the van, a man in his 40s, was airlifted to hospital in London following the incident, while the road remained closed for hours.\\nAt the start of the first unrestricted summer holidays since Covid struck in 2020:\\nAn environment\u00a0minister said disruptive protest groups such as Extinction Rebellion are 'absolutely right' and the pressure they exert 'does work'.\\nLord Goldsmith said while they are 'annoying', their road blockages and property damage are productive.\\nThe Conservative peer warned this week the Tories would be 'digging our electoral grave' if the next prime minister abandoned the party's net zero commitments.\\n'The principle is absolutely right,' Lord Goldsmith told BBC Radio 4. 'There is a real anxiety that we are heading towards a cliff and we're not doing enough. And that's true, we're not. That kind of pressure... may be annoying but it works.' Earlier this year his brother Ben made similar comments and faced calls to resign from his position as non-executive board member at Defra.\\nYesterday traffic jams built up on the M5 during a 'go-slow' protest against high fuel prices organised by Fuel Price Stand Against Tax. About ten vehicles drove at 20mph and affected the M5 in Somerset and routes around Bristol.\\n\\nYesterday's chaotic scenes heaped fresh misery on travellers who have already suffered months of disruptions at understaffed airports and endured strike action on the railways. But the war of words with France dominated as Dover chief executive Doug Bannister said they had been 'badly let down'.\\nPort officials insist they had been preparing for a busy summer for months \u2013 doubling the number of border control booths and sharing traffic volume forecasts 'in granular detail' with the French.\\nBut French border officers operated just six of their 12 booths at Dover during the early morning.\\nThe resulting queues stretched for miles and backed up into Dover town centre and on to the M20. Natalie Elphicke, Conservative MP for Dover, accused French officers of failing to turn up for work.\\nShe added: 'The French need to get a grip on this situation and get those passport booths staffed at maximum capacity during this critical weekend for holiday getaways.\\n'The first two weekends of the summer holiday are the busiest. It's highly likely there'll be a repeat this weekend and next weekend.'\\nHer fellow Tory MP Greg Smith claimed the French were 'cutting off their nose to spite their own face because Brits love France'.\\nHe said: 'It just beggars belief that the French are not doing everything they possibly can to secure the fast flow of passengers through their border controls.'\\nThe French official responsible for border management said that the delays were due to an 'unforeseeable technical incident'.\\nTheir passport booth staff journey through the Channel tunnel to reach Dover.\\nGeorges-Francois Leclerc, a regional prefect, said: 'The plan was to have all booths manned by 8am. But an unforeseeable technical incident in the tunnel meant that police had to push back their full deployment by an hour.'\\nHis claims were dismissed by Eurotunnel's John Keefe who said: 'The incident at the port started overnight well before a minor technical incident in the Channel tunnel. There is absolutely no correlation between the two.'\\nA port source admitted it was likely the delays would run throughout the rest of weekend and potentially into next week. 'Once you've lost control of the queue, it's hard to get it back,' they added.\\nBernard Poon found himself trapped in the chaos with an unhappy toddler and three-month-old baby in the back of his car.

It came day after protestors glued themselves to another painting at Kelvingrove.", "text": "Eco-zealots who glued themselves to the frame of Vincent Van Gogh's Peach Trees In Blossom painting yesterday are repeat offenders who have taken part in a series of other protests.\\nJohn Lennon lookalike Louis McKechnie is best known for strapping himself to a goalpost during a football match between Everton and Newcastle back in March.\\nThe 21-year-old stormed the pitch half way through the Premier League\u00a0clash and zip-tied himself to the woodwork wearing a bright orange t-shirt saying: 'Just stop oil.'\\nMcKechnie halted play for seven minutes before the stadium's staff prised him free with a huge pair of bolt cutters and hauled him off the pitch where he was arrested.\\nHe has also been accused of smearing red paint on the Queen Victoria memorial as part of an Animal Rebellion protest and blocked access to oil terminals in Essex.\\nHe was joined at Just Stop Oil's latest stunt at the Courtauld Gallery in London on Thursday by psychology student\u00a0Emily Brocklebank.\\nShe too has been spotted at previous eco demonstrations, including at the group's sit-down action at\u00a0Kingsbury Oil Terminal,\u00a0as well as at an Insulate Britain protest on the M25 in Hertfordshire last year.\\nThe Met Police confirmed two people were arrested\u00a0for criminal damage after yesterday's incident at Somerset House and that the pair remained in custody.\\nYesterday's stunt came just 24 hours after\u00a0protestors\u00a0glued themselves to Horatio McCulloch's My Heart Is In The Highlands 19th-century painting in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and spray-painted their logo on the walls and floor of the building.\\nFive people were arrested and are expected to appear at the Glasgow Sheriff's Court.\\nThe latest action comes amid warnings that the Provence region in southeastern France, depicted in Van Gogh's peach tree painting, may soon be experiencing a drought after\u00a0rainfall levels were 45 per cent below historic averages.\\nJust Stop Oil, which has previously carried out protests at oil terminals and the UK Government offices in Edinburgh, said it is calling for art institutions to join the group in 'civil resistance' against climate change.\\nMcKechnie, from Weymouth in Dorset, said: 'As a kid I used to love this painting, my dad took me to see it when we visited London. I still love this painting, but I love my friends and family more, I love nature more. I value the future survival of my generation more highly than my public reputation.\\n'The scientists are saying we need to end fossil fuel licensing and the government is pouring sand in their ears. I'm not willing to be marched to my death by the fossil fuel companies and their government puppets.\\n'It is immoral for cultural institutions to stand by and watch whilst our society descends into collapse. Galleries should close. Directors of art institutions should be calling on the government to stop all new oil and gas projects immediately. We are either in resistance or we are complicit.'\\nThe second protestor at the gallery was Emily Brocklebank, 24, who is a psychology student from Leeds.\\nShe added: 'I'm taking action today because I can't live in a bubble of normality when society is collapsing around us and people in the global south are suffering so much.\\n'Billionaires are getting richer whilst nurses queue at food banks, tens of millions of people across the world are starving and half the world's population is exposed to extreme danger from heatwaves, floods, fires and famine. Meanwhile the art establishment, the politicians and the fossil fuel companies look the other way.\\n'I love art, everywhere I go I visit all the galleries. Art is so important, it captures history and a moment in time, but artists and the art establishment are failing us by focusing on the wrong things. We need everyone to focus on the government's genocidal plans to allow fossil fuel companies to drill for more oil. This is one of the greatest injustices in history. We must resist.'\\nA Met Police spokesperson said: 'At 15:32hrs on Thursday, 30 June police were called to Somerset House, WC2 after two protestors glued themselves to a picture frame.\\n'Officers attended and arrested a man and a woman for criminal damage.\\n'Specialist officers worked to ensure their swift and safe removal and they have been taken into custody.\\n'There are no reports of any injuries.'\\nDespite his age, McKechnie is a seasoned disruptor who has caused havoc in recent months with Insulate Britain's protests on major UK roads.\\nThe mechanical engineering student was one of nine demonstrators hauled to the High Court for breaking a government injunction stopping the thugs gluing themselves to carriageways including the M25 last year.\\nThe lout was locked up for three months in HMP Thameside, but on his release after half that time he boasted how he had been 'terrified' but was welcomed by other lags who he claimed were 'entertained' by his protests.\\nHe told LBC in January: 'My experience of prison has emboldened me to take any future action regardless of whether prison is a consequence.'\\nHe continued: 'I feel that if we were able to save these 8,000 to 30,000 lives that are lost every year to fuel poverty, I'd spend the rest of my life in prison for that.'\\nHe added: 'I see the only way that these protests will stop is when our demands are met.

It said another paper from February 2020 confirmed the Government\u2019s support for self-identification ended after she was replaced as the minister in charge of the policy.\\nBut Miss Mordaunt told the BBC\u2019s Sunday Morning programme she had never advocated ending the requirement for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria to legally change gender.\\n\u2018This has been rebutted many times,\u2019 she said. \u2018We all know what is going on. This is the type of toxic politics people want to get away from.\\n\u2018We did a consultation. We asked healthcare professionals what they thought. I managed that consultation. We didn\u2019t actually, on my shift, produce a policy. There is a number of smears going on in the papers.\u2019\\nLast night, on the second TV debate, Mrs Badenoch repeated a claim she had been responsible for reversing a policy after Miss Mordaunt left as equalities minister.\\nShe said: \u2018When I took on the role of equalities minister, we had to change the existing government policy which previous ministers had put in place.\\n\u2018What I\u2019m challenging or what I challenged Penny on is what that policy was. She is saying she did not agree with it, but I don\u2019t understand how that would be the case if she had been the previous minister. If she didn\u2019t agree with it, why was the policy as it was?\u2019\\nMiss Mordaunt replied: \u2018I wasn\u2019t the previous minister. The stuff in the papers today demonstrates what my policy was and refutes this.\u2019\\nAccording to reports, a document drawn up by civil servants in 2019, when Miss Mordaunt was equalities minister, says: \u2018It has been very helpful to clarify in recent weeks several elements of how you would like to reform the Gender Recognition Act.\u2019 This included \u2018ministerial agreement around removing the need for a diagnosis of gender dysphoria\u2019.\\nIn June 2018, Miss Mordaunt gave a speech to Tory LGBT+ activists in which she said she \u2018can\u2019t even be seen to be helping with\u2019 the proposed legislation on gender transition, The Spectator reported.", "image": [["Penny Mordaunt (pictured) last night faced fresh questions over her judgment for meeting a controversial Muslim group \u00bf despite it being subject to a government boycott", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/17/21/60375911-11022757-image-a-39_1658091021588.jpg"], ["The Tory leadership hopeful was a minister when she met the leader of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), Zara Mohammed (pictured)", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/17/21/60375913-11022757-image-a-40_1658091030037.jpg"], ["Miss Mordaunt tweeted in February last year that it was \u00bfgreat\u00bf to have met the MCB\u00bfs first female secretary-general, Zara Mohammed, and said she was \u00bflooking forward to working with her\u00bf", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/17/21/60376013-11022757-image-a-44_1658091365512.jpg"], ["Mob mentality: Protesters dancing in the street in Melbourne in 2019", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/17/22/60376445-11022757-image-m-47_1658092451468.jpg"]], "author": ["Claire Ellicott Political Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "date": "2022-07-17"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-11066401/Lewis-Hamilton-cuts-stylish-figure-4k-Cartier-ring-ahead-F1-Grand-Prix-Hungary.html": {"title": "Lewis Hamilton puts on another pre-race fashion show as he models a burnt orange sweater and \u00a34,180 Cartier ring ahead of the F1 Grand Prix in Hungary", "subtitle": ".", "text": "He's known for his unique sense of style.\\nAnd Lewis Hamilton turned heads once more as he walked the paddock ahead at\u00a0the F1 Grand Prix of Hungary in Budapest on Sunday.\\nThe racer, 37, cut a stylish figure in a burnt orange textured cardigan which he teamed with matching black trousers.\\nThe sportsman wore a pair of circular black sunglasses after arriving on site,on the final day of the Grand Prix.\\nLooking focused, Lewis strolled through the grounds layered in gold necklaces and a statement piece watch.\\nHe wore his signature braids in a high ponytail as he showed off his collection of rings, including a Cartier ring retaining at \u00a34,180.\\nSlipping his feet into black patent boots the racer toured the paddock before the all important race.\\nLater Lewis slipped into a boiler suit emblazoned with the teams logo as he prepared to hit the track.\\nDonning a baseball cap he listened to his bluetooth headphones as he seemingly got into the zone ready to win.\\nThe outing comes after Lewis showed his support behind the climate activists who invaded the track at this year's British Grand Prix earlier this month, where he took a record 13th podium at a single race.\\nNorthamptonshire Police said seven people were arrested after the invasion on the opening lap of the Silverstone contest, after five protestors stormed the Wellington Straight before sitting down.\\nThe race had already been suspended following Zhou Guanyu's high-speed crash, followed by a 53-minute delay before the restart in a high octane, action-packed day at Silverstone.\\nLewis backed the protests on Twitter -

For disrupting the city\u2019s traffic is the Olympic canoeing champion\u2019s game these days - only he does not get quite the same level of support.\\nPopularity is something this rebel with a cause has had to sacrifice after swapping paddling with Team GB for protesting with Extinction Rebellion, the controversial climate activist group whose civil disobedience has caused chaos across the country.\\n\u2018I've been arrested 10 times and I've been convicted twice for public order offences,\u2019 the 43-year-old tells the Mail on Sunday from the Holme Pierrepont White Water Course in Nottingham, where he still occasionally coaches. \u2018Both of them related to sitting in the road and refusing to move when asked to by police.\\n\u2018It is controversial. I do admit that and I understand. But I think it's important that we are controversial because otherwise these issues will not be visible. Why would we risk our liberty and potentially being disliked if it wasn\u2019t so important?\u2019\\nStott\u2019s most recent high-profile protest came in April this year when he glued himself to the top of a Shell oil tanker on Bayswater Road, next to Hyde Park in London \u2013 one of the Olympic venues from 10 years ago.\\n\u2018I\u2019m still under investigation for that,\u2019 says Stott. \u2018It was scary. It was quite a surreal moment in my life. I never would have expected to do something like that. I knew it was going to be controversial and I knew it was going to cause a stir.\\n\u2018But you have to try to do the things that seem right - motivated by a sense of responsibility and duty. I believe this is a morally sound thing to do because we're in a dire emergency. The cost of doing these things is not insignificant, but I believe the cost of inaction is far, far greater.\u2019\\nThe Government has recently proposed a new Public Order Bill to crack down on the type of demonstrations that Stott has been involved in. It includes a maximum jail sentence of six months for protestors who attach themselves to objects or buildings.\\nSo would Stott be prepared to go to prison? \u2018I feel what I am doing is too important to be silenced,\u2019 he insists. \u2018And I think that will mean that I will be at risk of imprisonment. If it looks like it's going to come to that then I may have to deal with that.\u2019\\nSuch talk is a world away from the days when Stott was feted rather than castigated \u2013 the high point of his canoeing career coming on August 2, 2012 at the Lee Valley White Water Centre.\\nIt was there that sixth-ranked pair Stott and Baillie wowed the 12,000-strong home crowd by winning a shock gold in the two-man canoe slalom. To make their victory even more memorable, British team-mates David Florence and Richard Hounslow took silver behind them \u2013 Team GB\u2019s only one-two of London 2012.\\n\u2018I can feel my hair standing up as I'm talking now,\u2019 smiles Stott. \u2018In canoeing, the previous biggest crowd we'd ever raced in front of was probably about 3,000 people, so it was a huge step up and a huge step into the unknown. It was only when we crossed the finish line that it hit me. The noise was massive. The atmosphere was incredible.\\n\u2018We knew we'd done a good run and one by one the boats just went behind us. It got to the point when Florence and Hounslow were the last boats down the river and the British crowd knew they were guaranteed a gold. They finished behind us by a smidgen and we were the Olympic champions. It was wild. It\u2019s like your life moves into a parallel track.\\n\u2018I remember standing on the podium, the sun shining on the side of my face, the national anthem playing and thinking, \u201cI want to hold on to this moment but it's happening right now\u201d. It was extraordinary. It seems surreal. I suppose to some degree it still is.\u2019\\nStott and Baillie\u2019s win was one of six medals and three golds that Team GB won on day six of the Olympics \u2013 moving them up from 11th in the medal table to fifth.\\n\u2018I think that was a day that the British public were like, \u201cOh man, this is actually getting good now\u201d,\u2019 recalls Stott. \u2018Our event was on the Thursday before Super Saturday, so the scene was really set. By the time that happened, if you were in, you were in, and if you weren't in by then, there was kind of no hope for you!\u2019\\nTeam GB ultimately finished third in the medal table with 65 gongs \u2013 their best haul since London 1908. More importantly, that summer brought a feel-good factor across the country rarely seen since.\\n\u2018I can see in your eyes and I can see in the eyes of people I talk to when I talk about London 2012, that the experience was very, very positive for a lot of people,\u2019 says Stott. \u2018I do think it was one of the highlights of our country's history. It brought a lot of people together. It was a collective, positive, beautiful experience that people still really connect with now.\u2019\\nFor Stott, the good times kept rolling for weeks. As well as that parade through London, where Team GB athletes boarded 21 floats, one of his highlights was being invited backstage as a VIP guest at a secret Stone Roses gig in London.\\nLike other gold medallists, he had a post box painted gold in his honour in his home town of Bedford, where he also enjoyed an open-top bus tour and had a white water arena named after him. Then there was the small matter of being awarded an MBE by the Queen at Buckingham Palace.\\n\u2018All those experiences are almost a bit hard to capture because they're just so beyond what you imagined,\u2019 he says. \u2018I always say it's like being in a film of your own life. You just can't really quite believe what's happening.\u2019\\nStott carried on canoeing but, after failing to qualify for Rio 2016 with new partner Mark Proctor, he hung up his paddle. It was then that the Olympic champion started championing the climate cause.\\n\u2018On the day I retired, I went vegetarian,\u2019 says Stott, who is also the founder of athlete campaign group Champions for Earth. \u2018Shortly after that I became a vegan, then I stopped flying.\\n\u2018As an athlete, I was interested in the environment, but it was only a few years later that I really connected with how dire this situation was and how important it was to become an active participant rather than just watching from the sidelines.\\n\u2018I visited lots of schools and I was talking to young people about my experience in sport. They\u2019d say what they wanted to do and I was beginning to find it more and more tricky.\\n\u2018I just realised that all this beautiful human potential was facing a brick wall. It made no sense for me to be talking to them about the different lessons that I learned in sport when their world was being destroyed. For me, it just wasn't logical or responsible to continue that work when I actually felt that something needs to be done about saving and planning for those future generations.\\n\u2018Around the same time Extinction Rebellion came along and I felt what they were saying was correct. The planet is in a dire emergency and peaceful civil disobedience seems to have some promise to remedy this situation.\u2019\\nFor Stott, it is now about leaving a legacy far greater than anything he was able to achieve by winning a gold medal at London 2012. \u2018I\u2019m trying to inspire and protect the generation that I was supposed to inspire in London,\u2019 he adds.\\n\u2018When I was racing, I felt like it was a life and death struggle. It meant everything to me. But now I am involved in a genuine life and death struggle \u2013 this is the life and death of our future.\u2019", "image": [["Etienne Stott is an Olympic gold medallist who has now joined the Extinction Rebellion cause", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/24/09/60628827-0-image-a-5_1658652376490.jpg"], ["Stott won goald with Tim Baille in the men's canoe double final at the Games in London in 2012", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/24/09/60628849-0-image-a-6_1658652411779.jpg"], ["Stott (sitting, left) has been arrested 10 times by police in the UK as part of his protest work", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/24/09/60628877-0-image-a-7_1658652463726.jpg"], ["Stott says the hair stills stands up on the back of his neck when talking about his gold medal", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/24/09/60628839-0-image-a-8_1658652527214.jpg"], ["Stott has had an MBE awarded to him by the Queen for his part in that unforgettable summer", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/24/09/60628851-0-image-a-9_1658652567734.jpg"]], "author": ["David Coverdale For The Mail On Sunday"], "date": "2022-07-24"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10973043/Police-warn-protesters-people-killed-ahead-plans-disrupt-Grand-Prix.html": {"title": "Police warn eco zealots that people could be killed if they go ahead with plans to disrupt British Grand Prix by invading Silverstone track", "subtitle": "Northamptonshire Police said it had received 'credible intelligence' of a threat.

Still very anxious and tired as, until I can get to Euston, there is not really any support.'\\nAt King's Cross today, the queue for refunds and information stretched along the concourse and restaurants were full. Among those trying to travel today was journalist Karen Bourne, who was attempting to get to Peterborough.\\nShe told MailOnline: 'I got in from Barcelona yesterday and I was due to go to Peterborough last night.

But there's nothing the train services can do when the lines buckle under the heat. It has been unprecedented weather.\\n'My wife and I don't know when we'll be able to get home. Hopefully the trains will be running this afternoon.'\\nEventually, stranded passengers cheered and rushed to board a special train put on to take passengers to Peterborough and relieve the crowding at King's Cross.\\nHundreds of people crammed onto the slow train which left at 9.40am and filled carriages including first class, despite having standard class tickets.\\nRail bosses hoped to carry passengers from Peterborough onto Yorkshire and Scotland as repairs were continued at the location in Bedfordfordshire.\\nCharles Hurley, 74, a tourist from California who was heading to Edinburgh, boarded the train and told MailOnline: 'I have never heard of 'Peter's Borough' but they say it has a cathedral so if we get stuck there, at least there is a new bit of Britain to get to see.'\\nA member of train staff, with a sense of irony, apologised to passengers and said: 'I am sorry you are all running a bit late.'\\nSimon Pumphrey, Infrastructure Director for Network Rail's East Coast route, said: 'The heat has caused numerous challenges for the railway. Our teams remain on site to deal with the damage caused by the fire at Sandy.\\n'We're working as hard as we can, but the complexity of the work means there will be severe disruption to trains on the East Coast Main Line today.\\n'The incident has also disrupted our plans to manually inspect the route between Peterborough and King's Cross for any other damage and carry out any repairs, so we'll be working today to do that.\\n'We're sorry if this impacts on your plans and we're doing what we can to restart services as soon as possible. In the meantime, please check before travelling via National Rail Enquiries or with your train operator.'\\nOn the West Coast Main Line, there were no direct trains between London and Scotland today as Network Rail engineers worked to repair multiple sections of 25,000-volt overhead electric cables which power services.\\nTeams worked throughout the night trying to restore the power lines that were damaged between Lancaster and Carnforth in Lancashire; at Harrow in North West London; at Birmingham New Street; and near Wolverhampton.\\nThis repair work continued today in all locations meaning fewer trains will be running in and out of London Euston, and rail replacement buses were in operation between Preston in Lancashire and Carlisle in Cumbria.\\nJust Stop Oil protesters have been hauled away by specialist climbing officers after they scaled gantries and blocked three parts of the M25\u00a0- causing seven hours of traffic chaos and fury among drivers.\\nActivists climbed a gantry over the M25 at the\u00a0Poyle Interchange between Junction 14 and Junction 15 near Heathrow Airport, with police having to close the motorway in both directions while specialist officers attended the scene.\\nA similar demonstration took place near Junction 10 between Cobham and Guildford today, causing nine miles of traffic and hour-long delays. This stretch of the motorway has also since reopened following the arrest of a 22-year-old woman, according to police.\\nBut the M25 just north of the Queen Elizabeth Bridge in Thurrock remains closed after a protester climbed another gantry between Junctions 30 and 31.\\nIn a statement released shortly before the demonstrations, Just Stop Oil said it was 'declaring the M25 a site of civil resistance' this week. The group asked that 'no one travels on this motorway from Wednesday to Friday this week as we will be blocking the highway'.\\nAvanti West Coast said its train services on other routes out of London Euston may also be cancelled.\\nJames Dean, Network Rail's West Coast South route director, said: 'We're sorry to passengers impacted by the damaged caused to our overhead electric lines during the record-breaking heat.\\n'Specialist teams worked all night but have been unable to fix the cables in time for the start of service this morning. We're doing everything we can to get things back up and running.'\\nThere were also major issues at St Pancras, with all trains cancelled on the East Midlands Railway (EMR) route while engineers carried out safety checks between London and Kettering. Services were expected to start at 10am.\\nThe only trains running out of St Pancras today were Eurostar and Southeastern High Speed services to Kent. EMR said there were also checks taking place between Cleethorpes and Barton-on-Humber, and Peterborough and Ely.\\nRail passengers using the Midland Main Line north from St Pancras are being advised not to travel first thing this morning while safety checks continue.\\nIt follows record temperatures in the East Midlands on Tuesday which were higher than the design limits for track and overhead line equipment.\\nNetwork Rail said services were stopped on the\u00a0Midland Main Line between Bedford and Kettering and London yesterday afternoon as a safety precaution, and the safety checks could only be made in the daylight today.\\nThere will be no Thameslink services until late morning at the earliest today on the routes between Bedford and London via St Albans; London and Sutton via Wimbledon or Mitcham Junctions, London and East Grinstead, Littlehampton or Orpington; and between Peterborough and Hitchin.\\nGary Walsh, route director for Network Rail in the East Midlands, said: 'We're really sorry that the impact of the extreme weather at the start of this week is affecting passengers for a third day.\\n'Our teams will be out travelling the rails at first light to carry out the necessary inspections to allow us to fully reopen the network as soon as possible.\\n'As long as no serious faults are found we expect to have the route between Bedford and London open during the morning and the lines out to Kettering soon afterwards. We have extra response teams on shift who will respond as quickly as possible if any damage is found. I'd ask all passengers to check with your operator before you set off.'\\nThe Caledonian Sleeper which runs overnight services between Euston and Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Inverness, was suspended - with some passengers spending the night on trains held in London or Scotland.\\nNational Rail has told customers to check before setting off on their journeys and to only travel if absolutely necessary.\\nIt said on its website: 'A huge amount of work has been completed overnight to fix problems with the track and overhead wires caused by the heat yesterday.\\nThis weekend will be the busiest summer getaway in at least eight years, drivers have been warned.\\nThe RAC said an estimated 18.8 million leisure trips are planned in the UK between Friday and Monday. That is the most since the company began tracking summer getaway numbers in 2014.\\nLeisure traffic volumes look set to peak on Saturday, a survey of 1,700 UK motorists suggested.\\nTransport analytics company Inrix believes the M25 - London's orbital motorway - could see some of the worst jams, singling out the stretches between Bromley and the Dartford Crossing; Maple Cross and the M3; and the M23 to the M40.\\nThe A303 near Stonehenge, Wiltshire, the M4 between Cardiff and Newport in south Wales, and the M5 south of Bristol are also likely to see queuing traffic at various points this weekend.\\nRAC spokesman Rod Dennis said: 'The extreme heat that's affecting much of the UK in the last few days might wane over the next few days, but we still expect the summer getaway to begin with a bang as a potentially record-breaking number of drivers take to the roads this coming weekend - and that's despite the unbelievably high cost of fuel.\\n'With school terms in England and Wales finishing this week and millions of people ready for a well-earned break, we anticipate a frantic Friday followed by a woeful weekend on major roads across the country, with traffic and congestion likely peaking on Saturday.\\n'The advice to drivers heading off on a holiday by car is therefore clear - leave as early as you can in the morning or expect to be sat in some lengthy queues.'\\nInrix transport analyst Bob Pishue said: 'Drivers should expect traffic congestion to build throughout the day, especially on motorways. Despite high fuel prices, travellers do not appear to be giving up their road trips and holidays.'\\nNational Highways head of road safety Jeremy Phillips said: 'With schools breaking up for summer soon there will be more people on the roads and taking longer journeys.\\n'We know that breaking down can be a very upsetting experience, nobody wants to start off their holiday stranded at the side of the road, next to fast moving traffic. So we are reminding drivers to check their vehicles, particularly the tyres, before setting off.'\\n'Network Rail teams are continuing to work tirelessly to make the repairs so we can get services back up and running for passengers but there is still disruption to services throughout the day. So, for anyone travelling today, please take time to check before you travel.'\\nNetwork Rail said passenger numbers yesterday were around 40 per cent lower than the same day last week.\\nOverhead electric wires were down in Rugby, Birmingham and Carlisle, leading to a number of trains being trapped and emergency evacuations of passengers.\\nNetwork Rail Wales apologised for having to close the Cambrian Line between Dovey Junction and Aberystwyth 'due to extreme heat'. And no rail services were running into or out of London King's Cross yesterday.\\nIt comes as after temperatures topped 40C in the UK for the first time ever.\\nA new record for the hottest day ever seen, of 40.3C, was recorded in Coningsby, in Lincolnshire, yesterday afternoon - beating the previous record of 38.7C in Cambridge three years ago, by 1.6C.\\nAmid the sweltering heat, major incidents were announced by fire brigades in London, Leicestershire and South Yorkshire as dozens of fires broke out amid the sweltering heat - with flames ripping through houses, schools and churches.\\nThe temperature is set to drop by up to 10C in some areas today, with heavy showers and thunderstorms to lash parts of the country, potentially causing localised flooding.\\nThe Met Office said 34 observation sites across England provisionally broke the previous all-time record, ranging from Bramham, in West Yorkshire, to Charlwood, in Surrey, while a further five had equalled it yesterday.\\nA total of six sites, mostly in Greater London, saw temperatures reach or exceed 40C.\\nHowever, two 'large-scale' incidents took place in Upminster and the village of Wennington in East London, where black smoke billowed into the air, while flames destroyed buildings and ravaged nearby fields.\\nSeveral other significant incidents also occurred in the capital, with people urged not to have barbecues or bonfires due to the 'unprecedented' challenges crews face.\\nElsewhere, a serious blaze occurred in Barnsley when a row of houses in the Moorland Avenue area was consumed by flames, with crews continuing to battle fires elsewhere in the area.\\nDoncaster Council said a major blaze in Clayton also spread to three residential properties and there were reports of houses on fire in the Kiverton Park and Maltby areas of Rotherham.\\nNine people have died since Saturday in swimming accidents.\\nInterim deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, Miriam Deakin, said the heatwave was forcing hospitals to scale back the number of planned surgeries and install cooling units and try to cool down IT server rooms.\\nAnd an East of England Ambulance Service spokesman said the service had seen above-average call numbers since Monday afternoon and it expected to still be seeing an impact from heat-related illness into the weekend.\\nRoad congestion in several cities, including Birmingham, London and Manchester was down yesterday, as people heeded advice not to travel, while commuter numbers were also down on the Tube and bus services in the capital.\\nAnd sales of fans, ice cream and paddling pools and burgers rocketed as the heatwave sparked a spending spree on summer essentials, according to retailers, while tech experts urged smartphone users to keep their gadgets out of the sun to ensure they continue working properly.\\nThe Met Office said there would be a showery and thundery breakdown of the heat today, with a yellow warning for thunderstorms in place for parts of south east, east and central England in the afternoon and evening.\\nIt warns people to expect flooding or lightning strikes, delays and some cancellations to train and bus services, spray and sudden flooding, road closures and possible power cuts.\\nIt will be fresher for most places, although some parts of East Anglia will still see temperatures reach as high as 30C. Today's rain, where it occurs, will be much heavier than yesterday.", "image": [["Huge crowds waited for updates on concourses next to platforms at King's Cross, pictured",

These reforms include our use of technology and data, our culture and our policing approach. We will fight crime with communities - not unilaterally dispense tactics.\\n'I also know that the majority of officers and staff retain an extraordinary sense of vocation and determination and want us to do better. It is my job to help them do that, whilst also being ruthless in removing those who are corrupting our integrity'.\\nHis appointment has been agreed by Tory Home Secretary Priti Patel and Labour's London Mayor Sadiq Khan after they clashed over Ms Dick's departure when Mayor Khan pulled the plug and forced her to resign.\\nMs Patel said: 'Sir Mark Rowley is a distinguished and exceptionally experienced police officer, having served the people of the West Midlands and Surrey before guiding the capital through some of its most challenging moments in the wake of the 2017 terror attacks, as the Met's then head of counter-terrorism.\\n'He now takes on one of the most important and demanding jobs in policing, leading the country's largest force at a time when public trust in the Metropolitan Police has been severely undermined by a number of significant failings. Rebuilding public trust and delivering on crime reduction must be his priority'.\\nMayor Khan said: 'A series of appalling scandals have not only exposed deep cultural problems within the Met, but have contributed to a crisis of confidence in London's police service.\\nSir Mark has made clear to me that he is determined to be a reforming Commissioner, committed to implementing a robust plan to rebuild trust and confidence in the police and to drive through the urgent reforms and step change in culture and performance Londoners deserve.\\n'As Mayor, I will support and hold him to these promises as I continue to hold the Met to account'.\\nThe news comes less than two weeks after the force was put into special measures by the police watchdog.\\nA letter from HMICFRS cited numerous fiascos at Britain's largest force, including the murder of Sarah Everard by serving officer Wayne Couzens, the 'racially profiled' stop and search of the Team GB sprinter Bianca Williams, and the strip-search of a 15-year-old black schoolgirl known as Child Q.\\nIt follows further scandals, including the failure to properly investigate serial killer Stephen Port and the revelation of racist WhatsApp messages exchanged by officers at Charing Cross Police Station.\\nOther calamities included the jailing of two officers for taking photos of the corpses of murdered sisters Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry, and Operation Midland - the disastrous probe into fake claims of VIP paedophilia.\\nThe force was also heavily criticised for failing to stop Extinction Rebellion protests from shutting down London, with videos of officers dancing with protesters sparking claims the force was not taking the issue seriously.\\nThe\u00a0HMICFRS has two stages of its monitoring process for police forces - the 'scanning' phase and the 'engage' phase.\\nThe scanning phase\u00a0'uses data and information from a range of sources to highlight poor or deteriorating performance and identify potential areas of concern'.\\nIf the force is 'not responding to a cause of concern', or if it is 'not succeeding in managing, mitigating or eradicating the cause of concern', then it will be moved to the 'Engage' phase.\\nAt this point, forces develop an\u00a0'improvement plan' to address concerns and must meet with inspectors regularly to ensure improvements are being made. It may also be given specific targets.\\nThe Met has been escalated straight to 'engage', suggesting HMICFRS is particularly concerned about its performance.\\nA spokeswoman for the HMICFRS said: 'We can confirm that we are now monitoring the Metropolitan Police Service through our Engage process, which provides additional scrutiny and support to help it make improvements.'\\nThe chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation hailed the arrival of Sir Mark Rowley as the force's new Commissioner today.\\nKen Marsh, who heads the union of the rank-and-file Met officers, said: 'I welcome Sir Mark Rowley as the new commissioner, I think he\u2019s the right man for the job.\\n'I, and my colleagues, are pleased that the position has been filled because the void was harming us during a very difficult period, especially with the force being put into special measures.\\n'What we would ask for now is for the Mayor and the politicians to back off and stop the incessant attacks and let Sir Mark get on with the job in hand to deliver results for the people of London.'\\nSir Mark is\u00a0a familiar figure after leading the Met's counter-terrorism operations for four years. Although he resigned from the police in 2018, Sir Mark is still only 58 and has been tempted back by the biggest job in British policing.\\nHe served as chief constable of Surrey for three years to 2011 before he joined the Met as an assistant commissioner for seven years having\u00a0starting on the beat in Birmingham in 1987.\\nWhen at Surrey he was the lead officer in the hunt for Milly Dowler.\\nHe later admitted that his detectives were aware at the time of Milly's disappearance that her mobile phone was hacked by someone working at the News of the World.\\nSir Mark said a call made from the paper to the operation room leading the investigation in 2002 made it clear her voicemail had been accessed.\\nBut officers merely 'focused on retrieving any evidence the NotW had that could assist in the investigation into Milly Dowler's disappearance' as that was the priority, he said.\\nHis career in policing spans over 30 years, during which time he has transformed national security and policing.\\nAs Chief Constable, he lifted the public confidence levels in Surrey to the highest in the country.\\nAfter joining the Metropolitan Police Service, Sir Mark transformed the approach to UK counter-terrorism and policing gangs, increasing community engagement and workforce diversity, leading the police response to the London terror attacks of 2017 and reducing shootings and murders in London to an all-time low.\\nHe also led reform in policing of public order, organised crime and fraud, launching the 200 strong Op Falcon team to combat the growth of online fraud and cybercrime.\\nSince leaving policing in 2018 he has worked in specialist security projects and on technology/data led transformation with 'start-ups' and the world's largest professional services company. He has focused on: countering extremism and racism, online safety, institutional integrity and illicit finance.\\n\\nIn 2014 the notorious Operation Midland was sanctioned by Dame Cressida Dick, who later went on to become Scotland Yard commissioner.\\nFive years later, when the embarrassing operation began seriously unravelling, she refused to allow an inquiry into the conduct of officers involved.\\nThis was despite former High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques revealing how officers had used false evidence to obtain a search warrant for the raids. Dame Cressida said that an inquiry would be 'completely improper'.\\nA report in 2020 found the Metropolitan Police was more interested in covering up mistakes than learning from them.\\nThe Hampshire home of the Queen's confidant, Lord Bramall \u2013 who was also former head of the Armed Forces \u2013 had been invaded by police with search warrants in the early hours on the basis of spurious allegations of abuse by paedophile Carl Beech, a palpable fantasist.\\nAfter the Daily Mail exposed him, Beech was jailed. Before he died, D-Day hero Lord Bramall told his son Nick that 'he had never been so mortally wounded, even in battle'.\\nFormer Tory MP Harvey Proctor, who received a substantial payout after his life was ruined by the disastrous paedophile inquiry, last night expressed his delight at Dame Cressida's downfall.\\nHe was among seven high-profile victims of the Met \u2013 including Baroness Lawrence, whose son Stephen's 1993 murder investigation was botched by racist officers \u2013 who last year came together in a Mail interview to accuse Dame Cressida of having 'presided over a culture of incompetence'.\\nIn March last year, 33-year-old marketing executive Sarah Everard was abducted, raped and murdered by serving Met police officer Wayne Couzens.\\nIt then emerged Couzens had not been vetted properly and Met officers had failed to investigate after he was reported flashing women days before the murder.\\nBut perhaps the worst moment for Dame Cressida Dick was her officers' heavy-handed policing of a vigil for the murdered woman at Clapham Common in South London.\\nPhotographs of protesting women being pinned down by arresting officers who cited Covid restrictions on gatherings were published around the world, sparking condemnation.\\nWhen Couzens was convicted, it was dubbed Scotland Yard's 'darkest day'. Dame Cressida stood outside the Old Bailey and humbly admitted the murder had corroded trust in the police and brought 'shame' on her force.\\n\\nMURDER PHOTOS\\nIn December last year, two Scotland Yard officers who took photos of the bodies of two murder victims were jailed.\\nThe sisters who died \u2013 Nicole Smallman, 27, and 46-year-old Bibaa Henry, were black and there were accusations of racism. 2021 was also the force's worst ever year for teenage killings, with 30 deaths.\\nCHARING CROSS\\nEarlier this year, details emerged of horrific messages exchanged by officers at Charing Cross police station, by an official watchdog report.\\nSome 14 officers were investigated as a result, with two found to have a case to answer for gross misconduct.\\nOne was sacked and another resigned before he would have been dismissed. Another two had already left, while in some of the other cases the Independent Office of Police Conduct found 'no further action should be taken'.\\nIncredibly, nine officers kept their jobs and two were promoted \u2013 but their sickening WhatsApp messages exposed an ongoing culture of racism, sexism and bullying.\\nIt appears this sickening episode was the straw which finally broke the back. For, by the end, it was clear that confidence in the police chief had gone.\\nIn 2019, the force was widely condemned for its 'light-touch' policing of Extinction Rebellion protests, which blocked several key areas of London.\\nUnder her watch, career eco-activists from XR and its off-shoot Insulate Britain were given free rein to cause mayhem.\\nAmbulances were stopped from getting through, while businesses and workers were forced to halt their activities.\\nA low point came when police were filmed asking road-blocking protesters if they needed anything \u2013 rather than just arresting them.\\nPerhaps the most jaw-dropping condemnation of Dame Cressida came in June of last year when an official report described her force as 'institutionally corrupt'.\\nAnd far from blaming the fiasco on a predecessor, it concluded that she had personally placed 'hurdles' in the way of a search for the truth about the death of Daniel Morgan \u2013 a private investigator who was brutally murdered in a south London pub car park in 1987.\\nDame Cressida was accused of 'obfuscation' for thwarting the Morgan inquiry team's attempts to access sensitive documents, leading to delays that cost the taxpayer millions. The report by Baroness O'Loan found that Scotland Yard was 'institutionally corrupt'.\\nThe Met has never found Mr Morgan's murderer, but there were long-standing allegations of police corruption over the killing and the aftermath.\\nMr Morgan's brother Alastair also joined Baroness Lawrence, Harvey Proctor and Lord Bramall in a devastating and unprecedented joint interview with the Daily Mail.\\nThey all signed a letter to the PM demanding Dame Cressida's resignation. Instead she clung on.\\nAn inquest jury ruled in December that failures by Met detectives contributed to the deaths of a serial killer's three final victims.\\nStephen Port killed four men, all aged in their early 20s, by giving them overdoses of the date rape drug gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) at his east London home between June 2014 and September 2015.\\nHe was jailed for life at the Old Bailey in 2016 for the murders and a string of sex assaults.\\nThe inquest found police failed to carry out even basic checks after each murder.\\nA solicitor for the victims' families said the Met's actions were driven in part by homophobia.\\nLast week watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) announced it will re-investigate the Met's handling of the case.\\nIn April it emerged that five Met officers are to face a gross misconduct hearing over their stop and search of Team GB athlete Bianca Williams in 2020.\\nThe sprinter and partner Ricardo Dos Santos, the Portuguese athlete, were stopped in their car in west London, and separated from their three-month-old son who was in the back of the vehicle.\\nNothing illegal was found in the search and the couple, who are black, claim they were racially profiled.\\nLast month the IOPC confirmed it was investigating a series of cases which involved teenage girls who were on their period being strip-searched by Met officers.\\nTwo of the cases, involving a black girl named only as 'Child Q' and a mixed race girl known as 'Olivia', took place in December 2020. A third case is also under scrutiny.\\nChild Q was strip-searched at her school in Hackney, east London, by two female after being wrongly suspected of carrying drugs.\\n\\n", "image": [["Mark Rowley, pictured in 2017 when he was Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner in charge of counter-terrorism, will replace Cressida Dick", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/08/14/60038313-10995267-image-a-2_1657287155016.jpg"], ["Priti Patel has backed Sir Mark to turn around the force weeks after inspectors found it was failing badly", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/08/14/60038427-10995267-image-a-10_1657287229362.jpg"], ["Sir Mark Rowley appointed as new Metropolitan Police Commissioner", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/08/14/60038767-10995267-Sir_Mark_Rowley_appointed_as_new_Metropolitan_Police_Commissione-a-38_1657287895289.jpg"], ["The Met's scandal ravaged former commissioner, Cressida Dick, who stepped down in February after Sadiq Khan said he no longer had confidence in her", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/08/14/59629795-10995267-The_Met_s_scandal_ravaged_former_commissioner_Cressida_Dick_who_-a-37_1657287883527.jpg"], ["Sarah Everard was murdered by Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens, in a crime that appalled Britain.", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/08/14/54036189-10995267-f_Sarah_Everard_who_was_murdered_by_Metropolitan_Police_officer_-a-33_1657287354783.jpg"], ["Dame Cressida was also slammed by the families of victims of VIP paedophile ring fantasist Carl Beech, whose spurious allegations were investigated by police - ruining the lives and reputations of those he accused", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/08/14/45416125-10995267-Dame_Cressida_was_also_slammed_by_the_families_of_victims_of_VIP-a-11_1657287328139.jpg"], ["Wayne Couzens", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/08/14/54031565-10995267-Wayne_Couzens-a-14_1657287328164.jpg"], ["Bibaa Henry, 46,\u00a0 and Nicole Smallman, 27, who were stabbed to death in Wembley last year", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/08/14/44925209-10995267-Bibaa_Henry_46_and_Nicole_Smallman_27_who_were_stabbed_to_death_-a-16_1657287328178.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/08/14/53634009-10995267-image-a-17_1657287328182.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/08/14/53634013-10995267-image-a-19_1657287328200.jpg"], ["Further mock-ups of messages sent by a male officer during another shocking conversation on WhatsApp", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/08/14/53634017-10995267-Further_mock_ups_of_messages_sent_by_a_male_officer_during_anoth-a-22_1657287328209.jpg"], ["Daniel Morgan, pictured, was investigating claims of corruption within the Metropolitan Police when he was murdered in 1987 - and the force failed him and his family ever since", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/08/14/44115721-10995267-Daniel_Morgan_pictured_was_investigating_claims_of_corruption_wi-a-23_1657287328212.jpg"], ["His brother Alastair told the media today that Cressida Dick should resign", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/08/14/44249541-10995267-His_brother_Alastair_told_the_media_today_that_Cressida_Dick_sho-a-24_1657287328213.jpg"], ["Stephen Port", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/08/14/53359863-10995267-Stephen_Port-a-27_1657287328229.jpg"]], "author": ["Martin Robinson, Chief Reporter", "James Fielding"], "date": "2022-07-08"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11057507/Somerset-XR-protesters-occupy-600-year-old-oak-tree-stop-cut-A303-road-scheme.html": {"title": "Extinction Rebellion protesters occupy 600-year-old oak tree to stop it being cut down for \u00a3250m A303 road-widening scheme", "subtitle": "The XR protesters have been spending weeks living in the tree near A303 to try to stop it being cut down.

Frankly pathetic, especially since pro cyclists almost fell because of you... that's pathetic,' one user said.\\nEarlier this month, police officers picked up and dragged eco protesters who had tried to block the Tour de France race route away from the road.\\nEco protesters have tried to disrupt other sporting events in France, but the authorities have acted swiftly.\\nIn June, an environmental activist interrupted\u00a0the French Open men's semi-final between Marin Cilic of Croatia and Norwegian Casper Ruud for 15 minutes when she jumped onto Court Philippe Chatrier and tied and glued herself to the net.\\nThe woman, a French citizen, wearing a t-shirt that read 'we have 1028 days left' tied herself to the edge of the net with a string around her neck.\\nThe message, written on both sides of her white t-shirt, was a reference to a UN report on climate change.\\nBut security guards spread out around the court before removing the woman from the net. The four security guards were pictured carrying the woman away from the court.\\nMeanwhile, eco protesters were dragged from a busy motorway by furious French drivers after they blocked the road in Paris last month.\\nDespite the efforts of commuters,\u00a0kilometres of traffic formed along the\u00a0A13 motorway as the\u00a0demonstration was prolonged by the high-vis-clad group, who kept shuffling back into the middle of the road.\\nThe group behind the protest is 'Dernier R\u00e9novation', the French equivalent to Insulate Britain, who campaign for the thermal renovation of buildings.\\nPolice officers arrived at the scene and quickly removed the protesters from the middle of the road.\\nIn another example of European authorities responding quickly to eco protesters, a man was dragged away by security guards after throwing a custard pie at the famous Mona Lisa painting at the Louvre art gallery in Paris in May.\\nWitnesses said a man, who was wearing a wig and dressed as a woman, was rolling past Leonardo da Vinci's famous masterpiece in a wheelchair before suddenly leaping to his feet and launching a pie at the canvas.\\nThe perpetrator then threw a bouquet of roses into the air and was tackled to the ground by Louvre security guards moments later. The man was later taken into police custody.\\nNo damage was caused to the priceless painting which is protected by a bulletproof screen.\\nSpain\\nIn Spain, authorities are fighting back against eco protesters who have tried to disrupt major events and vandalise public buildings.\\nIn June, dozens of climate protesters covered Spain's parliament building in Madrid with red paint in a demonstration against the government's failure to act quickly against climate change.\\nRiot police arrived at the scene quickly and dispersed the protesters, with some officers picking up the activists and dragging them away. At least 10 protesters were arrested following the demonstration.\\nMany of the protesters wore white lab coats and were from the activist group Scientist Rebellion, which includes people from the scientific community.\\nThe protesters, many of whom wore white lab coats, form part of the relatively new activist group called Scientist Rebellion.\\n'If we scientists don't act like we're in an emergency, how can we expect the public to do so?' the group asks on its website.\\nGermany\\nFrustrated motorists and police officers have physically hurled protesters off the road after the demonstrators blocked major roads in Berlin in June.\\nPolice officers quickly dragged protesters from the road after they had sat in the middle of the busy road to stop the traffic.\\nOther protesters had glued themselves to the road, so police used cooking oil to loosen their hands.\\nSeveral truckers got out of their vehicles to berate the activists while a few expressed support for the climate cause but questioned the way the protests were conducted.\\n'They need to find a different way to do this than to block other people,' said one driver on his way to work, who would only give his name as Stefan.\\nBerlin's mayor has called the street blockades 'crimes,' while the city's top security official is demanding that prosecutors and courts mete out swift convictions. So far, no cases have gone to trial.\\nLina Schinkoethe, 19, is among the eco protesters who blocked the road in Berlin and who was jailed for her protest at what she\u00a0believes is the German government's failure to act against climate change.\\nSchinkoethe is part of a group called Uprising of the Last Generation that claims the world has only a few years left to turn the wheel around and avoid catastrophic levels of global warming.\\n'We need to generate friction, peaceful friction, so that there's an honest debate and we can act accordingly,' she said.\\nThat sentiment was echoed by Ernst Hoermann, a retired railway engineer and grandfather of eight who has been traveling to Berlin from Bavaria regularly to take part in the protests.\\n'We basically have to cause a nuisance until it hurts,' he said as a police officer tried to unstick him from the road with the help of cooking oil.\\nThe Netherlands\\nPolice in the Netherlands have cracked down on eco-protesters who have tried to block major roads.\\nIn May, police officers arrested 175 climate protesters from Extinction Rebellion after they set up camp on one of the busiest streets in the city of Rotterdam and blocked the traffic.\\nVideo shows the police dragging the activists away from the road - but many of the activists had stuck themselves to the road with glue, meaning officers had to use Coca Cola to remove their hands from the tarmac.\\nThe protesters had been holding signs which read 'Keep the oil in the ground' and 'Let the fossil fuel industry go extinct'.\\nProtesters also threw fake blood on the office of oil and gas giant Shell during the protests.\\nPolice officers issued warnings to the protesters to disperse, but when they refused, the cops began arresting the demonstrators.\\nPortugal\\nWhile British police officers have stood by helplessly as eco-zealots disrupt major events, Portuguese police have reacted swiftly.\\nIn June, officers in Lisbon pushed Greenpeace activists off the U.N. Ocean Conference premises as they tried to stage a protest in support of strong\u00a0action to save the world's seas and marine life.\\nAbout 7,000 delegates were at the conference, including heads of state, scientists and NGOs, to assess progress in implementing a U.N. directive to protect marine life. French President Emmanuel Macron attended the event.\\nTen Greenpeace activists from different countries tried to place large stickers with messages such as 'Killed by political inaction' and 'Protect the oceans' on billboards outside the venue, but officers stopped the action and pushed them out.\\nAs activists were blocked from carrying out their demonstration, a police officer told them: 'It's a fair fight but not here, OK?'\\nUK\\nWhilst the public and authorities have responded quickly in European countries, British police officers have largely stood by while Britons suffer with long motorway queues and famous paintings are vandalised.\\nEarlier this month, Just Stop Oil activists provoked fury when they carried out a protest at the National Gallery by covering John Constable's The Hay Wain with their own version featuring double yellow lines, pollution and a washing machine.\\nBritish guards stood by as they allowed the activists cover the painting and glue their hands to the frame.\\nMore than an hour later,\u00a0Brighton students Hannah Hunt, 23, and Eben Lazarus, 22, were finally arrested.\\nJust Stop Oil activists have carried out similar protests over the past month at art galleries in Glasgow, Manchester and London - while the group blocked a motorway on Wednesday, causing nine hours of traffic chaos on the M25.\\nThree eco-activists accused of sparking nine hours of traffic chaos by climbing on to the gantry above the M25 are set for trial after pleading not guilty.\\nCressida Gethin, 20, Alexander Wilcox, 21, and Emma Mani, 45, are charged with causing a public nuisance following a Just Stop Oil demonstration on Wednesday morning.\\nThey are accused of forcing the motorway to close in both directions by climbing on an overhead gantry and unfurling banners.\\nThey pleaded not guilty at Ealing Magistrates' Court in west London on Friday.\\nIn May, an eco mob which forced Lloyd's of London to close its City headquarters was finally moved on by police eight hours after protesters blocked all 25 entrances and scaled the outside of the building.\\nExtinction Rebellion fanatics, some of which were dressed as rats and cleaners, descended on the iconic office at 7am in May and used superglue, chains and bike locks to block ways in and out of the building, forcing staff to work from home for the day.\\nWhile the insurance firm insists the action did not disrupt trading, it still took police nearly eight hours get the activists to leave the protest which was calling for Lloyd's to stop insuring coal, oil and gas projects.\\nIt is not known whether City of London Police have arrested any members of the eco-warrior group, some of whom scaled the outside of the building and unfurled banners, reading 'End Fossil Fuels Now' and 'Insure Climate Justice'.

And with teaching taking place online, some of the material she saw unfolding on her daughter's laptop at home was little short of horrifying.\\nIsla's 'lessons' \u2014 46-year-old designer Clare uses the term loosely \u2014 included a lecture on white privilege; playing a rap song with the lyrics 'our Prime Minister is a real racist'; and an art lesson where pupils were encouraged to produce their own Black Lives Matter poster after being shown an image of black and white people stabbing each other.\\nSex education meanwhile \u2014 delivered under the new 'relationship and sex education' policy that has become a compulsory part of the curriculum since 2020 \u2014 was no less disturbing. It turned out to be provided by the dubiously named 'School for Sexuality Education', an external organisation with links to a commercial website that promotes pornography and sex toys.\\nAt its workshops, pupils were informed they lived in a 'heteronormative' (straight) world, that this was a bad thing, and they should be 'sex positive' instead.\\nAppalled at what she saw as little short of highly politicised dogma disguised as 'learning', Clare asked the school if she could see the material used in some lessons.\\nShe was told she couldn't, and her repeated \u2014 and ultimately futile \u2014 attempts to do so have now led her to make a formal complaint to the Information Commissioner's Office, an independent authority set up, among other things, to promote openness and transparency in public bodies.\\nShe believes that, if asked by a parent, schools should be legally obliged to provide information about the 'lesson plans' they use. At present, it is a matter of dispute as to whether they have any obligation to provide the information.\\nClare is not alone in her concern: in recent years, a number of campaigning groups have sprung up to tackle what they see as the overt politicisation of children, while a slew of stories has also highlighted the way in which gender and racial politics have crept into the provision of education.\\nIn the last week alone, a fee-paying Christian school in Oxfordshire has become engulfed in a row following a diversity-driven makeover in which the library was garlanded with rainbow LGBT flags, while Michelle Donelan, the Minister for Higher Education, has written to universities warning them that signing up to equality and diversity schemes could hamper free speech.\\nOn Thursday, Conservative MP Miriam Cates spoke of her concern that recent guidelines are opening doors to 'age inappropriate' and 'extreme' content being taught in schools.\\nClare, however, is one of the few parents prepared to talk openly about the problem, although understandably she has asked for anonymity for her family.\\n'I believe passionately in what I am fighting for, but as a parent I also want to protect my daughters,' she says. 'A lot of people are terrified of discussing this territory, but someone has to question what is going on.'\\n'Otherwise, it means that there is no transparency for parents regarding the messages being handed to our young people.' Clare and her husband are unlikely lightning rods: impeccably liberal, since marrying in 2001 they have lived in the London borough of Lewisham, a neighbourhood they chose for its diversity.\\nWhile privately educated herself, Clare was happy for both her daughters \u2014 Isla, now 15 and 12-year-old Natasha \u2014 to be schooled in the state system.\\nBoth attended the local primary where, in 2018, Clare had an early insight into the gender politics at play when Natasha, then nine, announced she'd been told to refer to historical figures as 'they' rather than he or she because those who had come before us were unable to choose their preferred pronouns and that there were 'many more than two genders'.\\n'That was when the warning bell rang,' says Clare. 'I complained to the school and was staggered by the pushback from governors and the head teacher.\\n'It was basically a case of 'there is no way you can touch this'.'\\nClare's concerns mounted when she learned that representatives from an organisation called 'Pop'n'Olly' \u2014 a self-styled 'LGBT+ equality educational resource' created by author and illustrator Olly Pike \u2014 were visiting the school during anti-bullying week.\\n'No one is against the idea of an anti-bullying week \u2014 but suddenly this message is being conflated with other more complex material,' she explains.\\n'The first thing I knew about it was when I arrived home to find my daughter watching an Olly Pike cartoon about a girl who has an overnight sex change which solves her bullying problem.\\n'Even if you take away the issue of whether you should be discussing trans-sexualism to children in primary school, this is highly misleading.'\\nWhen Clare complained, she was told that Olly Pike was recommended by the LGBTQ+ lobby group Stonewall which, in turn, was backed by the Department for Education.\\nAround the same time, Isla had started secondary school at Haberdashers' Hatcham College in Lewisham \u2014 one of a guild of schools founded by a legacy from 17th century benefactor Robert Aske. His name was removed from the school last year because of his purported links to slavery and, at Hatcham, his oil portrait has been removed and his statue repurposed.\\nA state comprehensive, Hatcham's intake is 83 per cent black and ethnic minority and 17 per cent white, but Clare says that children from all backgrounds largely got on well.\\n'It's an inner-city school so there are fights and there have been knife fears,' she says. 'But, overall, it is a successful, cohesive community and Isla has got very good friends.'\\nNonetheless, Clare said she had become concerned about what she saw as overt politicising by teachers, not to mention the peddling of misleading and in some cases downright inaccurate information in lessons.\\n'The first thing that made me prick up my ears was when Isla told me her English teacher had come in on his last day at the school wearing a Jeremy Corbyn T-shirt and telling them all they had to vote Labour,' she recalls.\\nNot long afterwards she learned that one of her daughter's peers \u2014 a 'youth coordinator' for the climate change activists Extinction Rebellion \u2014 was leafleting classmates, encouraging them to join the movement and try to get arrested. 'The teachers were overtly congratulating her,' she says.\\nClare raised her concerns with the school but says she was ignored, despite repeated attempts to secure a meeting.\\nThen came the first national lockdown of March 2020. With lessons taking place online, it gave Clare and her husband a chance to see what Isla was being taught. What they saw alarmed them, particularly in the aftermath of the tragic death of George Floyd at the hands of U.S. police officers in May 2020.\\n'One English teacher gave a lesson implying that America was a fascist police state and introduced the kids to a U.S. activist called Tamika Mallory,' says Clare. 'Some of her speeches are pretty incendiary, saying things like: 'I don't care if you burn down buildings.''\\nShe was further alarmed to learn that in another lesson, a teacher had played a song by a rap artist called Dave which features the lyric 'our Prime Minister is a real racist', while Isla and her school friends \u2014 then just 13 \u2014 had also been shown a painting in an art class of white and black people stabbing each other to inspire them to make their own Black Lives Matters posters.\\n'It's deeply unwise to use a picture of people stabbing each other in a place where there is genuine worry that people might carry a knife,' says Clare.\\n'Some of the resultant images produced by the children and praised by the teacher included a police station on fire and a girl being shot in the head.'\\nClare complained once more, and this time received a phone call from a Deputy Head who said they were under huge pressure from staff to respond to Black Lives Matter in the curriculum.\\n'I said I wasn't against that, but they had to be cautious as the organisation at its core is not just an equality movement but a political movement. The conversation was reasonable enough,' Clare recalls.\\nBut what followed was a series of four assemblies that talked about white privilege and systemic racism. 'There was a slide that said: 'Is your curriculum too white?' Clare recalls. 'Children were also told that the point of the BLM phrase is that black lives were being treated as expendable by the police and the government that employs them.\\n'This is against a backdrop of citizens burning things in America and in a London borough that had rioting in 2012. I felt it was completely irresponsible.'\\nAgain Clare and her husband complained until eventually, by autumn 2020, her grievance was heard before three school governors who upheld her complaint about the art class imagery and rap song, but insisted none of it was politically motivated.\\n'It meant our overall complaint about indoctrination was not upheld,' says Clare. 'One governor, an ex-High Court judge, concluded that my 'ideals and background' were misleading me.'\\nBy this stage Clare and her husband had already made the decision to send their youngest daughter to a private school. But with Isla settled, they were reluctant for her to move schools in the run-up to her GCSEs.\\nFor a while, things were calm \u2014but then last autumn, Clare was alarmed to learn of the nature of the school's RSE provision.\\nPreviously told the lessons would focus on 'inclusive consent', in reality, there was also lengthy discussion about 'heteronormativity' and the need to be 'sex positive'.\\nOn paper, the latter is defined by the need to have a healthy, shame-free attitude to all aspects of sexual conduct \u2014 but in reality, says Clare, is often a Trojan Horse via which to convey more troublesome ideologies.\\nEmboldened, Clare asked once more to see the lesson plans, and was once more denied access. 'At first, they wouldn't really tell me what the problem was, but then said the School of Sexuality \u2014 which, remember, provided content for the RSE lessons \u2014 had told them I couldn't see them because of their commercial interests. That seemed extraordinary to me,' she reflects.\\nClare then took matters into her own hands and called the School for Sexuality directly.\\n'I had a pleasant enough ten-minute conversation with the woman who answered the phone who seemed to agree that I could have access,' she says.\\n'In the wake of that, I learned the Chief Executive had contacted the school and accused me of harassment. She said on no account must the school show me the lesson plan as I was likely anti-LGBTQ+ and organisers 'would not be safe' if I was given the lesson plan.'\\nAt the same time, Clare's own research led her to discover that Nadia Dean, the organisation's 'workshop facilitator', runs a side business promoting sex toys and pornography.\\n'There was a link to that website on the organisation's own website. Another lady on the website links to her blog where she sings a song with her ukulele which features the words 'Let's all masturbate'.'\\nAfter initially being told that the links would be removed, Clare was informed the school would no longer be using the provider.\\n'I was clear they needed to do more than that \u2014 that they should notify the DfE that organisations, many of them funded by taxpayers' money and rubberstamped by government, are peddling deeply troubling ideas under the banner of promoting social justice.'\\nA spokesperson for the school said: 'At Hatcham College we want children to critically engage with a wide range of opinions and views that challenge received wisdom.\\n'PSHE lessons provide children with the space to explore difficult topics of historical and societal importance, and the vast majority of our parents are supportive of our approach.\\n'All our teaching and resources adhere to the Secretary of State's statutory guidance and best practice, in which they acknowledge areas of 'understandable and legitimate areas of contention' due to its depth and breadth.\\n'We are grateful to Ms Page for raising her concerns, and although her views are unrepresentative of our school communities, we recognise their legitimacy and the part they play in opening an interesting and wider debate about PSHE curricula and access.'\\nNonetheless it is clear many parents remain discomfited, while Paul Conrathe, Senior Consultant Solicitor at education specialist Sinclairslaw, says schools that hide behind commercial confidentiality are 'skating on thin ice'.\\n'The critical question is whether it is in the public interest not to disclose those materials,' he says. 'How can it be in the public interest to withhold curriculum materials that deal with controversial and sensitive matters on sexuality, sex, gender and race from parents?'\\nFor Clare, a principle is at stake. 'It has been difficult,' Clare admits. 'I've had to ask myself all the way through whether this is the right thing to do, whether I am burdening Isla too much with this.\\n'There's been a lot of talking, but ultimately, she has always agreed that what she is encountering doesn't feel right.\\n'We are agreed that parents have a right to know what is being taught to their children.'", "image": [["Haberdashers' Aske's Hatcham College, a 1,400-pupil state secondary school in South London runs lessons which includ a lecture on white privilege; playing a rap song with the lyrics 'our Prime Minister is a real racist'", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/02/12/59533943-10974899-A_parent_of_a_pupil_at_Haberdashers_Hatcham_College_pictured_in_-a-1_1656760739084.jpg"], ["At its workshops, pupils were informed they lived in a 'heteronormative' (straight) world, that this was a bad thing, and they should be 'sex positive' instead", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/01/23/59772241-0-image-a-51_1656715929214.jpg"], ["Appalled at what she saw as little short of highly politicised dogma disguised as 'learning', Clare asked the school if she could see the material used in some lessons", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/01/23/59772239-0-image-a-52_1656715934758.jpg"], ["Sex education \u2014 delivered under the new 'relationship and sex education' policy that has become a compulsory part of the curriculum since 2020 \u2014 was no less disturbing.

I mean, it's a John Constable masterpiece; a national treasure. Is it really this easy to paper over or - God forbid - destroy it?'\\nOther art lovers reacted with fury today, with one tweeting: 'Never mind about these losers. Where is the security? What were the guards doing while they stuck the 'reimagined version' on the original? Checking their WhatsApps?'\\nAnother added: 'Disgusting, please stop damaging historic and fragile paintings enjoyed by ordinary people in our national galleries and museums. Pls find another way to get your 'message' (whatever it consists of) across!'\\nAnd a third said: 'Unbelievably reckless. The wrong target. Art is not the target. It's so poorly judged. It sets back the net zero and climate debate by alienating the public. Art is not a legitimate target. This is childish, destructive and naive.'\\nThe\u00a0protesters were removed and arrested at 4.45pm and taken off site, and the painting was taken off the wall by staff at the gallery. Conservators are now taking a look at the work to assess whether any damage has been caused - but they have not got an estimate on any damage at this early stage.\\nJust Stop Oil activists have carried out similar protests over the past week at art galleries in Glasgow, Manchester and London - while a group also sat down on the track at Silverstone during the British Grand Prix yesterday.\\nToday's incident, which took place as security guards at the gallery watched on, will prompt concerns about the safety of other historic works of art on display in the UK - and whether security needs to be improved.\\nIt also comes in contrast to police quickly arresting 12 motorists for driving too slow during a protest on the M4 in South Wales over petrol and diesel prices. Fuel protests have been taking place across the UK today as drivers call for a cut in fuel duty, gridlocking motorways and major A-routes with a series of rolling go-slow roadblocks.\\nAt the National Gallery, the protesters - who wore white T-shirts bearing the slogan 'Just Stop Oil' - stepped over a rope barrier and then placed what looked like a large colour paper print on to the front of the large-scale painting.\\nEach also placed a hand on the frame of the painting and kneeled beneath it before loudly stating their concerns as visitors were ushered out by security staff.\u00a0The protest forced the evacuation of art lovers, tourists and a class of 11-year-old children on a school trip from the room where the painting hangs.\\nA National Gallery spokesman told MailOnline today: 'At around 2.15pm this afternoon two people entered Room 34 of the National Gallery and glued themselves to the frame of The Haywain by John Constable.\\n'They also covered the surface of the painting with 3 sheets of what appeared to be paper featuring a reimagined version of The Haywain. The pair wore t-shirts identifying themselves as \u2018Just Stop Oil\u2019 activists.\\n'Police attended and removed the protestors at around 4.40pm, and they were then arrested. The painting was removed from the wall to be examined by our Conservation team.\\n'The Hay Wain suffered minor damage to its frame and there was also some disruption to the surface of the varnish on the painting - both of which have now been successfully dealt with. The painting will be rehung in Room 34 ready for when the National Gallery opens at 10am on Tuesday 5 July.'\\nAnd a Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'At approximately 2.25pm on Monday, 4 July officers were called to a protest taking place inside the National Gallery, WC2 involving two people. Two people have been arrested and officers remain on scene.'\\nSpeaking about their new version of The Hay Wain, Just Stop Oil said in a statement today: 'The river has been replaced by a road, airplanes fill the sky, pollution belches from cities on the horizon, trees are scorched by wildfires, an old car is dumped in front of the Mill and the famous Hay Wain cart carries an old washing machine.'\\n23-year-old psychology student Hannah Hunt was pictured glued to The Hay Wain at the National Gallery on Monday.\\nShe described new fossil fuels as 'a death project by our government', despite facing criticism herself for previously sharing pictures from far-flung holiday destinations such as Bali, Australia and Canary Islands.\\nMs Hunt co-founded Just Stop Oil in February, marching on No 10 to tell Boris Johnson to prevent \u2018the ultimate crime against our country, humanity and life on Earth\u2019.\\nShe became a hero among supporters of the group, which formed as a breakaway of Extinction Rebellion.\\nThis year she glued herself to the red carpet at the Bafta awards, and she also broke into an ExxonMobil oil refinery in Hampshire.\\n\\nAspiring musician Eben Lazarus, 22, was seen alongside Ms Hunt as he supported her through Just Stop Oil's latest stunt.\\nHe and Hunt were removed and arrested at 4.45pm and taken off site, and the priceless national treasure was then removed by staff at the gallery.\\nThe eco-zealot was last pictured actively blocking departures at Gray's oil depot in Essex and also disrupting traffic on Britain's motorways.\\nLazarus's father is a musician and wedding singer, while his grandfather is Dr Norman Lazarus and 84-year-old professor at King's College London whose research interests include how to age more gracefully.\\nAmong today's protesters was Hannah Hunt, 23, a psychology student from Brighton, who said: 'I'm here because our government plans to licence 40 new UK oil and gas projects in the next few years. This makes them complicit in pushing the world towards an unlivable climate and in the death of billions of people in the coming decades.\\n'We can forget our \"green and pleasant land\" as further oil extraction will lead to widespread crop failures which means we will be fighting for food. Ultimately, new fossil fuels are a death project by our government.\\n'So yes, there is glue on the frame of this famous painting, but there is blood on the hands of our government. The disruption will end as soon as the UK government makes a meaningful statement that it will end new oil and gas licenses.'\\nBorn in Suffolk in 1776, John Constable is considered one of the foremost British artists.\\nLargely self-taught, he was influenced by Dutch painters - and is best known for his landscape paintings in Dedham Vale, the area in which he grew up.\\nHis most famous painting, The Hay Wain, is now exhibited at the National Gallery. Finished in 1821, The Hay Wain was one of six large canvases depicting the area around Flatford Mill in Suffolk.\\nAnother in the series, The Lock, became one of the most expensive British paintings ever sold when it fetched \u00a322.4million at auction in 2012.\\nDespite his works now attracting huge fees, Constable was not financially successful in life. He also struggled to gain recognition from his peers and was not elected into the Royal Academy until the age of 52.\\nHe died in March 1837, aged 60, of apparent heart failure, and was buried with his wife. His children John and Charles are also buried in the tomb.\\nAnd Eben Lazarus, 22, a music student from Brighton, said: 'I support Just Stop Oil's demand for our government to halt all new oil and gas projects in the UK immediately.\\n'I want to work in the arts, not disrupt them, but the situation we're in, means we must do everything we peacefully can to prevent the total collapse of our ordered society.\\n'I have a number of younger siblings, the youngest are just ten and twelve, and I refuse to stand and watch them being condemned to a future of suffering. Our government is failing in its fundamental duty to protect us.\\n'We have covered the Hay Wain with a reimagined version that illustrates the expected impact of our addiction to fossil fuels on our countryside. The painting is an important part of our heritage, but it is not more important than the 3.5 billion men, women and children already in danger because of the climate crisis.'\\nLast week, Just Stop Oil activists carried out similar protests in Glasgow, Manchester and London by gluing onto the frames of famous paintings including Van Gogh's 'Peach Trees in Blossom', 'Thomson's Aeolian Harp' by JMW Turner and 'My Heart's in the Highlands' by Horatio McCulloch.\\nPaul Bell 21, a physics graduate from Birmingham, and Edred Whittingham, 24, a student at Exeter University, have now been released from police custody after their action at the Manchester Art Gallery on Friday.\\nThey were released on unconditional bail to appear in court on October 5.\\nIt comes as the Just Stop Oil protesters who stormed yesterday's British Grand Prix remain in police custody after Formula One boss Stefano Domenicali labelled their actions as 'dangerous and irresponsible'.\\nFive men, aged between 21 and 46, and two women, 20 and 44, were arrested after the track invasion on the opening lap at Silverstone.\\nAlthough the incident was not shown on F1's global television feed, eyewitness footage emerged of five people entering the circuit at the high-speed Wellington Straight. They then sat down on the track.\\nThe race had just been suspended following Zhou Guanyu's horror first-corner crash, but a number of drivers sped by the quintet as they returned to the pits. The protesters were swiftly dragged away by marshals.\\nIn his post-race press conference, seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton defended the activists.\\nHe said: 'Big up those guys. Big up the protesters. I love that people are fighting for the planet and we need more people like them.'\\nLater on Instagram, the 37-year-old wrote: 'As we've seen today, this is a dangerous sport.\\n'I wasn't aware of the protests today, and while I'll always support those standing up for what they believe in, it must be done safely. Please don't jump on to our race circuits to protest, we don't want to put you in harm's way.'\\nF1 bosses and Silverstone officials had been alerted to a protest plot in the days leading up to the race by Northamptonshire Police. It remains unclear how the protesters managed to breach security lines.\\nF1 CEO Domenicali said: 'Everyone has the right to speak out on issues, but no one has the right to put lives in danger. The actions of a small group of people were completely irresponsible and dangerous.\\n'We shouldn't be complacent about the risk this posed to the safety of the drivers, marshals, fans and the individuals themselves.'\\nBut four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, an environmental campaigner, expressed his sympathy towards the activists.\\nHe said: 'These people don't act out of frustration, but they are desperate, and I very much sympathise with their fears and their anxieties which I think everybody who understands the size of the problem that's drifting towards us can understand.\\n'I also see the other side. Marshals are trying to stop people from doing these kind of things, and you are putting them, and the drivers, at risk.'\\nFormer England striker Gary Lineker sided with the climate activists, tweeting: 'If it's not already too late, history will look back very favourably on these people.'\\nBut Sky F1 pundit, and former driver, Martin Brundle took umbrage with Lineker's tweet, replying: 'Gary please don't encourage this reckless behaviour.\\n'They'd have been sliced into 100 pieces and fans, marshals and drivers were wholly at risk of injury and death. We already had one lucky escape. I totally 100 per cent support freedom of speech and opinion, but do it responsibly.'\\nJust Stop Oil is a protest group demanding that the Government 'immediately halts all future licensing and consents for the exploration, development and production of fossil fuels in the UK'.", "image": [["Protesters from Just Stop Oil cover John Constable's The Hay Wain at the National Gallery in London earlier this month", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/04/15/59848783-10980687-image-a-56_1656944474702.jpg"], ["Protesters from Just Stop Oil glue their hands to the frame of John Constable's The Hay Wain at the National Gallery on July 4", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/04/15/59848781-10980687-image-a-57_1656944477421.jpg"], ["Protesters from Just Stop Oil cover John Constable's The Hay Wain at the National Gallery in London", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/04/15/59848791-10980687-image-a-60_1656944479726.jpg"], ["Protesters from Just Stop Oil glue their hands to the frame of John Constable's The Hay Wain at the National Gallery today", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/04/15/59848813-10980687-image-a-71_1656944504787.jpg"], ["Hay Wain reaction", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/04/16/59851669-10980687-image-m-106_1656949936820.jpg"], ["Hay Wain reaction", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/04/16/59851663-10980687-image-m-108_1656949941917.jpg"], ["Hay Wain reaction", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/04/17/59851661-10980687-Hay_Wain_reaction-a-38_1656953799636.jpg"], ["Hay Wain reaction", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/04/16/59851667-10980687-image-a-114_1656949953412.jpg"], ["Hay Wain reaction", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/04/16/59851665-10980687-image-m-104_1656949931593.jpg"], ["Hay Wain reaction", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/04/19/59851675-10980687-Hay_Wain_reaction-a-29_1656960625376.jpg"], ["ORIGINAL PAINTING -

Don't we have a responsibility to take every means of trying to protect life on Earth?'\\nThe Climate Emergency Fund was started three years ago and believes causing issues for millions is an important way to get its message across.\\nIt has splashed out just over $7million on causes it believes in, with\u00a0executive director\u00a0Margaret Salamon comparing it to suffragist, civil rights and gay rights activists throughout history.\\nShe said:\u00a0'Action moves public opinion and what the media covers, and moves the realm of what's politically possible. The normal systems have failed. It's time for every person to realize that we need to take this on.'\\nShe dismissed the idea her group was helping spread misery across the world by saying\u00a0Martin Luther King had a poor approval rating in the years before he was assassinated.\\nThe\u00a0Climate Emergency Fund has also dished out\u00a0$170,000 to Save Old Growth, a Canadian group which blocks roads used by loggers in British Columbia.\\nCo-founder Zain Haq said:\u00a0'We're not trying to be popular. Civil disobedience historically is about challenging a way of life.'\\nMeanwhile in Britain the nonprofit handed eco-zealots from Just Stop Oil nearly $1million and helped with paying 40 protestors and organizers.\\nMiranda Whelehan, who is part of the group, said:\u00a0'Obviously, you can only do so much as volunteers. Huge oil companies have millions, if not billions.'\\nAnd in the US\u00a0the Climate Emergency Fund chucked $100,000 at\u00a0Scientist Rebellion - which counts NASA climate scientist Peter Kalmus among its ranks - to pay for consultant wages and travel costs.\\nHe said he had been looking for ways to save the planet for 16 years but decided the best way to do it was to cause mayhem for ordinary citizens.\\nHe joined around 1,000 scientists in 25 different countries in blocking traffic and chaining themselves to notable buildings - including the gates of the White House.\\nAfter the attack,\u00a0Kalmus said:\u00a0'I get messages every day from people who said it had given them hope. It seemed to communicate that urgency far more than anything else.'\\nMeanwhile Lambert and Case have been pumping money into The Equation Campaign, which they founded in 2020 to give financial backing and legal advice to those trying to stop fossil fuel expansion.\\nThe fund has helped those who have hammered through gas pumps, glued themselves to paintings and chained themselves to banks.\\nAbout $30million was pumped in by the two members of the Rockefeller dynasty, with both looking to right the supposed wrongs of their family.\\nCase said in an email to the New York Times: 'It's time to put the genie back in the bottle. I feel a moral obligation to do my part. Wouldn't you?'\\nThe Equation Campaign has seen relative success at stopping oil and gas expansion, having helped cancel an extension of the Keystone XL oil pipeline.\\nLambert and Case's initiative is the latest in a long-running effort from the Rockefeller family to address their family's history.\\nLambert has a master's degree in environment and natural resources and a background in climate and energy planning, and spends her time guiding retreats for environmentalists.\\nCase is an architect whose Rhode Island-based company, Truth Box, specializes in sustainable design.\u00a0 Their great-great-grandfather opened his first oil refinery in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1863.\\nWithin a few decades, Standard Oil controlled 90 per cent of petroleum production in the United States.\\nThe company was split up by the Supreme Court in 1911, with offshoots such as Exxon and Chevron forming from the remnants.\\nThe family's direct involvement in fossil fuels ended at that time, although some of the around 270 descendants of John D. Rockefeller work in the field, or have investments in the area.\\nIn 2003 Neva Rockefeller, an economist at Tufts, and John D.'s great-granddaughter, co-sponsored a resolution at Exxon's annual shareholder meeting demanding the company study climate change's impact on its business.\\nMembers of the Rockefeller family have since invested heavily in initiatives to highlight climate change, and in 2016 Exxon took the family to court, accusing them of funding a conspiracy against their company.\u00a0Many of the climate liability lawsuits against Exxon have been tied up in procedural wrangling over whether they belong in state or federal court.\\nThe family is divided on whether to support activism against fossil fuels.\u00a0In 2018 David Kaiser, another great-great-grandchild, told New York Magazine: 'If Exxon's stock price suffers, the whole family will lose money.'\\nAriana Rockefeller, a competitive equestrian rider who runs an eponymous fashion brand, called the campaign by her relatives 'deeply misguided,' and told CBS\u00a0in 2016: 'I don't think denouncing a family legacy is the best way to go about doing this.'\u00a0Last year Rebecca and Peter poured\u00a0millions of dollars into an effort aimed at supporting people on the front lines fighting new oil and gas development.\\nThey created the 'Equation Campaign' and pledged a combined $30 million of their personal wealth to the effort.\u00a0Among the causes they were supporting are protests against the Keystone pipeline, in the Dakotas, and activists fighting the replacement and expansion of the aging 'Line 3' oil pipeline in northern Minnesota.\\nAnother $5 million was pledged by other sources so far, with an ultimate goal of raising $100million.\u00a0The name of the effort comes from the idea that reducing demand for fossil fuels is only half of the 'equation' when it comes to addressing global warming; the other side of the equation is cutting off the supply.\\nIt is also campaigning against other fossil fuel projects and is helping eco-warriors targeted by what it claims are exaggerated charges and false arrests.\\nExecutive Director Katie Redford said: 'For the climate and literally for humanity to win, we need them to win, and to stop the industry from building more stuff that puts greenhouse gases into the environment.'\\nThe Equation Campaign and\u00a0Climate Emergency Fund stressed their groups only pump money into legal activists including training, education, travel and recruitment.\\nThey also shot back at claims paying the activists made their work less authentic, saying receipts have to be shown to ensure nothing illegal has taken place.\\nThe eco-warriors have said to money is desperately needed, with some ditching school or juggling multiple jobs to spend their lives protesting.\\nThe most recent protest to hit the US took place last week as demonstrators tussled with cops before being wrestled to the floor and carried out of\u00a0the stadium at the Congressional baseball game in DC\u00a0two weeks ago.\\nSome of the activists managed to enter the Nationals Park stadium, and unfurl banners.\u00a0Outside, three people were arrested as the game between Democrat and Republican lawmakers unfolded.\\nOne man rushed officers, and was swarmed on and pushed to the ground.\u00a0Another pair of demonstrators tried to get in to the venue, but were marched backwards, smirking, by a burly security officer.\\nWhen they tried to walk past the Metropolitan Police officer, he shoved one of them hard, causing him to fall backwards. Still trying to enter the area, he was surrounded by police who shepherded him away.\\nA blond woman was seen being carried by her arms and legs from the scene, while another activist stood nearby, zip ties on his wrists.\\nA group called Now Or Never claimed that they were behind the demonstration.\u00a0'Tonight we converged on the Congressional Baseball Game,' they tweeted.\\n'We are living through a climate emergency. Yosemite is on fire. An ice shelf the size of NYC just broke off of Antarctica. We're dying by the million from pollution.\\n'Congress must seal the deal. It's time.'\u00a0They added: 'Baseball can wait. The climate cannot.'\\nThe group said they want Joe Biden to declare a 'climate emergency', and Congress to spend billions on clean energy.\\n'We are deeply offended that our elected leaders continue to play games in the face of our impending doom,' said Michael Steffes, a spokesperson for the group.\\n'Our congresspeople are choosing to play ball while the world burns around them. Unless they treat this as a climate emergency and take immediate climate action, we are doomed to climate hell.'\\nThe group said they were angry at politicians 'wasting the world's time with their indefensible antics,' and said evidence of the scale of the problem was all around.\\n'St Louis is underwater, California is on fire, Lake Mead is running dry, the country's glaciers are melting, and drought is hammering the midwest, stretching the country's ability to cope with the growing number of people whose lives have been upended by the crisis,' they said.\\n'The one time that they come together in agreement is to play a literal game.\\n'Unless the United States government takes immediate & drastic climate action, they are sentencing billions of people to an unlivable future on a dead planet.'\\nThe Gettys built their fortune through a diverse range of ventures, but the family name would become synonymous with their most famous asset - oil.\\nJean Paul Getty, perhaps the most famous family member, was born in Minneapolis in 1892 and joined his father's Minnehoma Oil in Tulsa aged 21.\\nWith his father George Franklin Getty's backing, Jean Paul started buying and selling leases, and was reportedly made a millionaire by his first successful oil well venture in 1916.\\nHe took over Getty Oil over from his father - who had been an attorney before he turned to Oklahoma oil - when George Franklin died in 1930.\\nIn 1948 Jean Paul Getty won a 60-year concession in the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, agreeing to pay King Abdul Aziz $9.5million with a guarantee of $1million a year in royalties and 55 cents per barrel of oil.\\nIn 1957 Fortune magazine estimated Jean Paul, then 65, to have a net worth between $700million and $1billion, declaring him the richest man in the United States.\\nJean Paul, who was married and divorced five times, with five sons by four of his wives, died in 1976, leaving his son Gordon in charge of Getty Oil.\\nIn a few years' time Gordon would fight with the company's board over how best to increase the value of shares in the company, and Pennzoil and Texaco would fight for control of the company, sending Getty stock prices from $50 a share to $125 a share.\\nTexaco eventually triumphed in its bid, paying $10.1billion to take over Getty Oil in 1984, while the Getty family, who owned 40 per cent of the stock, saw tremendous profit from the sale.\\nAs of September 2019, Forbes reported Gordon Getty's net worth as $2.1billion, ranking 1,116 in the publication's 2019 list of billionaires.\\nTHAT'S how you deal with the eco mob: While British and US police stand by helpless, it's been a different story in Europe this summer, with protesters dragged away with no hesitation\\nFurious civilians and police officers in Europe are putting the rest of the world to shame by refusing to allow eco protesters to disrupt events and bring roads to a standstill - with the activists being dragged away with no hesitation.\\nFrom Italian security guards tearing protesters' hands off a Botticelli painting at a Florence art gallery to Tour de France fans angrily removing a group of eco activists from the middle of the road, the Europeans are taking matters into their own hands.\\nIn stark contrast, security guards at London's National Gallery simply watched on when eco-zealots covered\u00a0John Constable's priceless painting The Hay Wain\u00a0with their own version and stuck their hands to the frame with glue.\\nHere, MailOnline takes a look at how Europe is fighting back against eco protesters.\\nItaly\\nWhile British police officers have stood by helplessly as eco-protesters have blocked roads and vandalised priceless paintings, the Italian authorities have dealt with the activists without hesitation.\\nOn Friday, an Italian security guard tore protesters' hands off a priceless Botticelli painting at a Florence art gallery and dragged them away.\\nThe security official stormed over to the young activists and pulled their superglued hands from the Renaissance masterpiece shortly after they began their short-lived protest in the Uffizi Gallery.\\nThe unnamed man and two women were from climate\u00a0activist group Ultima Generazione ('Last Generation') and had rolled out a banner which read: 'Last Generation No Gas No Coal'.\\nThe activists, who had paid for tickets to get into the gallery, were removed from the gallery by police after the security guard dragged them away from the painting.\\nIt struck a jarring contrast to the inaction shown by British guards at the Trafalgar Square gallery this month, where Just Stop Oil zealots were allowed to cover over\u00a0John Constable's The Hay Wain with their own version.\\nMore than an hour later, Brighton students Hannah Hunt, 23, and Eben Lazarus, 22, were finally arrested.\\nMeanwhile,\u00a0Extinction Rebellion\u00a0activists were forcibly removed from a motorway by furious Italian motorists after they blocked the busy road in Rome last month.\\nDemonstrating over environmental issues, the protesters sat in a row across Rome's Raccordo - the city's main ring-road and one of its busiest - holding banners.\\nA video shot from the side of the two-lane road showed the demonstrators using road-block protest tactics also used in Britain, causing a huge traffic jam to snake back as far as the eye could see, with no police officers or vehicles in sight.\\nIn response, irate Italian motorists at the front of the queue jumped out of their vehicles to take action - dragging the protesters across the tarmac and dumping them on to the side of the road.\\nOne man ripped an orange banner from the hands of the\u00a0Extinction Rebellion activists and threw it over the side of the motorway barrier.\u00a0A woman, dressed in a summer dress while still carrying her handbag, tore a second sign from their grasp.\\nAfter removing the banners, a second man joined the first in forcibly dragging the protesters by their arms across the tarmac to the side of the road, making enough of a gap for several vehicles to get through and past the demonstration.\\nHowever, as the first man was dragging the remaining protesters off the road, the activists he had first removed saw an opportunity and ran back into the middle of the road, and in front of the on-coming traffic - only to sit down again with their banner.\\nWith the traffic again being blocked, the man grabbed one of the female protesters by the hair and dragged her again to the side of the road. This did not deter her, however, as she quickly shuffled back in front of the traffic.\\nThe video showed the man - wearing sunglasses, shorts and a T-Shirt - shouting in the face of the female activist who had sat back down in the middle of the road.\\nThis time, he picked her up and threw her to the side of the road. In the meantime, the second man was able to make a gap in the activists long enough for more cars and trucks to drive through and away from the scene.\\nBy the end of the video, however, the protesters are shown persisting with their efforts, blocking at least half of the road - again with their orange banner.\\nCorriere Dello Sport reported that the protest was eventually broke up with the arrival of local police, the Carabinieri (federal police) and the Digos (special forces) - with the protesters being taken into custody.\\nFrance\\nTour de France fans became so fed up with a group of eco-protesters who were threatening to disrupt the historic bike race by sitting in the middle of the road they angrily removed the activists.\\nEight climate activists from French campaign group Derni\u00e8re R\u00e9novation (Last Renovation) sporting T-shirts emblazoned with the message 'we have 978 days left' to tackle environmental decline tried to stop the race during the 20th stage\u00a0between Lacapelle-Marival and Rocamadour on Saturday.\\nBut their attempts to wreak havoc at the stage were thwarted by spectators, who stormed onto the road and dragged them out of the path of the oncoming bikes even before the police arrived on the scene to make arrests.\\nStriking pictures have emerged of the enraged fans bowling into the road to pull, push and harry the protesters off the tarmac to prevent them from ruining the race.\\nPolice officers were pictured arresting the eco-protesters by the side of the road.\\nStarted earlier this year, Derni\u00e8re R\u00e9novation (DR) is a French faction of the international climate activism conglomerate 'A22', which includes the likes of Just Stop Oil - a UK-based group which attempted to disrupt the British Formula 1 Grand Prix at Silverstone on July 3.\\nDR employ similar tactics to those used by the likes of Just Stop Oil and Insulate Britain, such as gluing themselves to the road to create congestion in large cities or putting themselves in harm's way to disrupt major events.\\nMany did not take so kindly to the protestors' actions, with several social media users in France expressing their disapproval at the 'pathetic' attempts to stop the historic bike race.\\n''Again with these charlatans... take action that is useful and not counterproductive... because no one supports you with your extremist positions,' one user wrote, while another tweeted: 'Their battle is lost - you don't change the mentality of 66 millions people by blocking an event of French heritage'.\\nMost seemed to sympathise with the cause, but disagreed with the way in which DR tried to raise awareness.\\n'I understand the group's motivations - but not by doing this kind of thing at such a cycling event... Frankly pathetic, especially since pro cyclists almost fell because of you... that's pathetic,' one user said.\\nEarlier this month, police officers picked up and dragged eco protesters who had tried to block the Tour de France race route away from the road.\\nEco protesters have tried to disrupt other sporting events in France, but the authorities have acted swiftly.\\nIn June, an environmental activist interrupted\u00a0the French Open men's semi-final between Marin Cilic of Croatia and Norwegian Casper Ruud for 15 minutes when she jumped onto Court Philippe Chatrier and tied and glued herself to the net.\\nThe woman, a French citizen, wearing a t-shirt that read 'we have 1028 days left' tied herself to the edge of the net with a string around her neck.\\nThe message, written on both sides of her white t-shirt, was a reference to a UN report on climate change.\\nBut security guards spread out around the court before removing the woman from the net. The four security guards were pictured carrying the woman away from the court.\\nMeanwhile, eco protesters were dragged from a busy motorway by furious French drivers after they blocked the road in Paris last month.\\nDespite the efforts of commuters,\u00a0kilometres of traffic formed along the\u00a0A13 motorway as the\u00a0demonstration was prolonged by the high-vis-clad group, who kept shuffling back into the middle of the road.\\nThe group behind the protest is 'Dernier R\u00e9novation', the French equivalent to Insulate Britain, who campaign for the thermal renovation of buildings.\\nPolice officers arrived at the scene and quickly removed the protesters from the middle of the road.\\nIn another example of European authorities responding quickly to eco protesters, a man was dragged away by security guards after throwing a custard pie at the famous Mona Lisa painting at the Louvre art gallery in Paris in May.\\nWitnesses said a man, who was wearing a wig and dressed as a woman, was rolling past Leonardo da Vinci's famous masterpiece in a wheelchair before suddenly leaping to his feet and launching a pie at the canvas.\\nThe perpetrator then threw a bouquet of roses into the air and was tackled to the ground by Louvre security guards moments later.
