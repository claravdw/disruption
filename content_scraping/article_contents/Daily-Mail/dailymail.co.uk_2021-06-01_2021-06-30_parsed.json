'[We have] zero tolerance for political actions that put lives at risk,' a police spokesman said.\\nMeanwhile Bavarian premier\u00a0Joachim Herrmann revealed that snipers were ready to take out the glider thinking he was a terrorist, but held off after noticing the Greenpeace logo and concluding it was a protester.\\n'If the police had come to a different conclusion that it could be a terrorist attack, then the glider might have had to pay for the action with his life,' Herrmann told Bild.\\nKai, whose last name was not published by German media, is already known to police for pulling off a similar stunt with two others in Frankfurt earlier this year.\\nThe trio used paragliders to land on the building of the European Central Bank in the city before unfurling a banner that read: 'Stop funding Climate Killers'. They left after four hours, and were charged with trespassing.\\nMeanwhile Munich mayor\u00a0Katrin Habenschaden, who was in the stadium at the time, also condemned the stunt, saying the crash was 'life-threatening' and it was only by chance that people were not more-seriously hurt.\\nGreenpeace attempted to defend the stunt today, saying the 'very experienced' pilot had been attempting to fly over the stadium on a glider powered by an electric battery to drop a 'soft ball' protesting VW.\\nThe group said an issue with the throttle caused the engine to cut out, prompting the pilot to try and make an emergency landing inside the arena - colliding with an overhead cable used by pitch cameras.\\n'Greenpeace Germany offers a full and unreserved apology to those who were injured and impacted as a result of our protest before yesterday's UEFA football match in Munich,' an official statement said.\\n'We are seeking to verify the extent of the injuries and hope for a quick recovery for all those affected.\\n'Greenpeace takes safety very seriously and will mount a full investigation into what went wrong. We will fully cooperate with all relevant authorities.\\n'We would like to repeat our full and unreserved apology to those who were injured and impacted as a result of this accident.'\\nThe Allianz Arena, where Bayern Munich play their homes games, was filled with some 14,000 fans at the time of the accident. Its usual capacity is 70,000, but that has been reduced due to Covid restrictions.\\nTournament organisers UEFA also slammed the botched stunt, calling it a 'reckless and dangerous' act and said 'law authorities will take the necessary action'.\\n'This inconsiderate act - which could have had very serious consequences for a huge number of people attending - caused injuries to several people attending the game who are now in hospital,' they added.\\n\\n'The staging of the match was fortunately not impacted by such a reckless and dangerous action, but several people were injured nonetheless.'\\nThey added: 'UEFA and its partners are fully committed to a sustainable Euro 2020 tournament and many initiatives have been implemented to offset carbon emissions.'\\nThe stunt took place just as Germany were about to kick off against France in their opening match of the tournament - a game they went on to lose thanks to a first-half own goal by Mats Hummels.\\nGreenpeace's stunt is hardly the first sponsor protest to have taken place at Euro2020, even though the tournament has been running for less than a week\\nOn Monday, Cristiano Ronaldo made headlines by removing two bottles of Coca-Cola from a table in front of him during a press conference, urging fans to 'drink water' instead.\\nUEFA responded with a terse statement that said 'everyone is entitled to their preferences' while pointing out that the notoriously fitness-obsessed sportsman would also have been offered water.\\nHis protest was followed by copy-cat action from French star Paul Pogba, who - after the France-Germany game had concluded - removed a bottle of Heineken beer from a press conference.\\nWhile Pogba has not made the meaning of the gesture clear, it is likely because he is a devout Muslim and Islam considers alcohol to be 'haram' - or 'forbidden'.\\nHowever, the bottle he removed appeared to be a 0% alcohol-free beer.\\nAnother protest that has stirred up controversy is the decision of England players to kneel on the field before matches to protest racial inequality - a gesture copied from the NFL.\\nIn response, some fans have been booing the national side while their opponents have also been forced to decide whether to join them in the gesture or stay standing.\\nIt is thought that Scotland will take a knee during Friday's game between the two sides, but that opponents Czech Republic will not join them when the pair face off next week.", "image": [["Spectators, officials and journalists take evasive action as the paraglider skims inches over their heads during his botched stunt at the Germany-France game in Munich last night", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], ["Spectators, officials and journalists take evasive action as the paraglider skims inches over their heads during his botched stunt at the Germany-France game in Munich last night", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/16/09/44277229-9689999-Spectators_officials_and_journalists_take_evasive_action_as_the_-a-1_1623833902853.jpg"], ["The activist skimmed over the heads of many in the crowd during his botched stunt.

anyone caught trying to end their five day quarantine period without proof of a negative test risks a 450 euros fine (\u00a3386), the Times reported.\\nThose who skip quarantine all together could face a much tougher penalty - last year, Italy introduced fines of 3,000 euros (\u00a32,580) for anyone who even tried to travel between regions, let alone cross its borders.\\n- If I can get myself there, where can I get a ticket?\\nThat could be tricky. The FA has said it will not be selling tickets for the match to the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) - the official body of away support - due to Covid-19 restrictions.\\nInstead it is hoping to get as many as tickets to England expats in Italy to make sure the team isn't playing in front of silent stands on Saturday, the Guardian reported.\\nThe statement said: 'Unfortunately, the FA will not be selling any tickets via the ESTC for this fixture given the travel restrictions in place across both countries, and as such are working with Uefa and the British embassy in Italy to facilitate as many ticket sales to English residents in Italy as possible.'\\n- What do I have to do on my way home?\\nFans who overcome all obstacles to get themselves to Rome by Saturday will still have to self-isolate for 10 days upon return, as Italy is on the UK's amber list.\\nReturning travellers will have to book a Covid-19 test for day two and day eight of their quarantine before flying.\\nPassengers can also use the 'test to release' scheme where they pay for a private Covid-19 swab on day five of their quarantine - if the results on both day two and day five are negative, you can end your quarantine.\\nThe Government website says people should not travel to amber list countries or territories.\\n\\nUkraine's ambassador to the UK has taunted England supporters who are banned from travelling to Italy for the Euros clash on Saturday.\\nVadym Prystaiko bragged his supporters could get into the country because they are in the 'green zone' and would be piling into the\u00a0Stadio Olympico in Rome.\\nMeanwhile\u00a0England fans with tickets to the match blasted quarantine rules that will stop them from going despite being double-jabbed or testing negative for Covid-19.\\nSupporters living in Britain can enter\u00a0Italy but will be ordered to self-isolate for five days, meaning even if someone flew in this morning they would not be allowed out until Sunday - after the match is over.\\nThe only way you are likely to avoid the isolation requirement is to prove that you are in Italy\u00a0for 'work, health or an emergency'.\\nMr Prystaiko told the BBC: 'Sorry to say but our people will find it easier travelling in. We are in the green zone for Europeans and we have so many Ukrainians to support them.'\\nIn reference to his side's game against Sweden in Scotland last night, he said: 'I was actually surprised yesterday how many of us were here at the Glasgow stadium.\\n'We already have so many of them working and studying in Italy, numbers I believe is close to a million people. I don't believe all of them will come to Rome, but we will have significant numbers to support our football team.'\\nBut in a blow for Ukrainians who went to the game at Hampden Park last night, they will not be able to make the Rome match due to Italy's five-day quarantine rule on travel from the UK.\\nIrate fans pointed out Uefa dignitaries will be given a quarantine exemption when they travel to\u00a0London for the semi-finals and final next month.\\nThe English Football Association will make it easy for the 30,000 or so Brits living in Italy post-Brexit to get tickets through the UK embassy in Rome.\\nAnd in a chink of hope the 70,000 seater Stadio Olimpico in Rome could still be packed with England fans, the 1.2million UK-born people living in the EU can head to The Eternal City for the match at 8pm on Saturday as long as they have not been to Britain over the past 14 days.\\nConor Garratt wrote: 'I have tickets to the QF in Rome on Saturday night - you know, the one England will be in, once they beat Germany tomorrow.

If they can stay near the stadium in Rome, perhaps with a balcony, they can soak up the atmosphere but not go into the stadium'.\\nEnergy Minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan urged people not to travel.\u00a0She said: 'The ask is to watch from home and to cheer on the team as loud as we can.\\n'I think the challenge is can they hear us from Rome and I am sure we will take up that opportunity to be as supportive as we can of our amazing England team.'\\nToday the nation is in euphoric mood after beating the old enemy Germany for the first time in a knockout match since winning the World Cup in 1966.\\nPrince William and Kate hailed England's 'incredible performance' as lucky royal mascot Prince George saw the Three Lions crush Germany 2-0 at his first international football match.\\nGareth Southgate's squad are now preparing to take on\u00a0Ukraine in the Euro 2020 quarter-final in Rome on Saturday - after an estimated 25 million fans across Britain watched Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane clinch the win in Wembley Stadium on Tuesday night.\\nLast night's match marked England's first major victory over Germany since the 1966 World Cup final, ending 55 years of heartache for the Three Lions.\\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George joined\u00a045,000 jubilant fans at Wembley Stadium to watch manager Southgate's\u00a0fine-tuned side run rings around German captain Manuel Neuer's team in a superb display of resilience and perseverance.\\nAfter the match, the couple took to their official Twitter account to praise England's 'incredible performance'.\\nThe England squad will now head to Rome to play Ukraine after the foreign team narrowly beat Sweden 1-0 in the last minute of extra time.

It is history. All the players were asked about the past games, but we created history.'

When you're a centre-forward it doesn't matter what else you're doing in the game, you need those goals and I was pleased to see the second one go in I have to say.'\\nSouthgate was asked if his side's win helped ease the memory of his penalty shoot-out miss in 1996.\\nThe former England defender said: 'I'm just so pleased.

It is all too easy to forget that the nature we need to protect is also blue.\\n'We look to the G7 leaders to stand up for the ocean and make it priority to protect both biodiversity and the climate.'\\nOn Saturday afternoon more than 1,000 protestors staged a noisy and colourful march through the centre of Falmouth as they held their biggest event of the G7 summit.\\nExtinction Rebellion co-founder Dr Gail Bradbrook was among those who took part in the march that included figures wearing lifelike paper mache masks of the world leaders at the Cornwall summit.\\nProtestors dressed as the grim reaper, suffragettes and others hidden beneath the costume of a Chinese dragon made their way from Kimberley Park though the centre of Falmouth.\\nThe only sign of disruption came with a splinter group called Animal Rebellion who occupied a McDonalds restaurant on the outskirts of the town.\\nPolice stood watch as the protestors, mostly teen girls, occupied all the tables preventing families from eating inside the restaurant.\\nThe protestors, who were all vegan, demanded McDonalds switch from serving meat hamburgers to plant-based meals.\\nThe protest was peaceful and one of the group, a student from Brighton, said their aim was to force McDonalds to stop selling meat. Waving an XR flag Dr Bradbrook said she was 'pleased' with the turnout of the protestors.\\n'We are here to show that enough is enough and that the world is dying. We are colourful and noisy and that has been our intention. When the music stops that signifies people that are dying because of inaction on climate change.'\\nAmong those taking part in the march were several NHS doctors. Andrew Stevenson, who works at the hospital in Somerset, said:' The climate emergency is a health emergency and has to be tackled.\\nAngie Nicholas, also a doctor in Somerset, said the pandemic was linked to the climate emergency. People have to sit up and take notice. The pandemic has its roots in climate change.'\\nBanners being carried at the march warned of the impending catastrophe unless action was taken.\\nAmy, 18, carried a 'drowning in promises' banner as she walked with four friends. She said: 'It is just a matter of making those in power listen to us. There has been no change for 30 to 40 year. I don't know if they will ever listen, but we have to try and speak up. It is my generation and future generations that will be affected.'\\nProtestors marched to the sound of loud drums and whistles. Every few steps they would stop and stand in silence.\\nA life-sized elephant painted white with the words HS2 \u2013 the planned railway line from London to the Midlands \u2013 was among the more creative of the costumes.\\nSeven figures dressed as the G7 leaders led the march with the Boris character enthusiastically copying his hand movements.\\nAs protests continued, Extinction Rebellion's 'Red Brigade' marched through Falmouth and demonstrators occupied a McDonald's as they called for action.\\nThe group's co-founder Dr Gail Bradbrook was among those who took part in the march that included figures wearing lifelike papier mache masks of the world leaders at the Cornwall summit.\\nMore than 1,000 protestors dressed as the grim reaper, suffragettes and others hidden beneath the costume of a Chinese dragon made their way from Kimberley Park though the centre of the seaside town.\\nSeven figures dressed as the G7 leaders led the march with the Boris Johnson character enthusiastically copying his hand movements.\\nThe Red Rebel Brigade, who walk silently with their hands upturned followed. Others in costume included protestors dressed as blackbirds, seven women in funeral black pushing white wheelchairs bearing the slogan 'Climate change kills children.'\\nSix people carried a giant globe through the streets as protestors handed out leaflets to locals who had stood on the pavement to watch.\\nThe Surfers Against Sewage group have called on the G7 leaders to regulate ocean pollution and ban the destructive extraction of ocean resources.\\nAmong those taking part was 26-year-old Jen from the village of Portreath. She said: 'I think it is important that the G7 leaders understand that we want change.\\n'I hope they will listen and by being here I feel that at least I am doing my bit to make our voice heard.'\\nDan Russell, 42, arrived with his 12-year-old son to take part in the protest. He said: 'This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to protest when all the world's leaders are so close. Will they listen? Probably not, but I am happy to take part.'\\nOn what is expected to be the hottest day of the year Gyllyngvase was packed with protesters and other holidaymakers.\\nEarlier, members of the climate change activists from Extinction Rebellion kicked off their protests with a football match between one team wearing masks of the G7 leaders against the rest of the world.\\nThe sand football match was deliberately rigged with the G7 team scoring into a large goal while the other team attempted to score in a mini goal.\\nThe match referee was a former professional footballer Will Bamford who played for a team in Singapore.\\nOne of the banners listed football clubs that the XR protestors said would disappear by the year 2050 due to rising water levels because of climate change.\\nAmong those listed were Premier League teams Chelsea and Fulham as their stadium is close to the River Thames.\\nHull City, Portsmouth and Blackpool from League One were also listed as being at risk from rising sea levels due to climate change. 'All the clubs on the banner will cease to exist unless climate change is tackled,' said one of the protesters.\\n'With the Euros starting it was appropriate that we staged our our football match. Unlike the Euros ours was rigged with the G7 to win because they bully the rest of the world.'\\nAnother banner took a swipe at Barclays Bank, one of the sponsors of the Premier League, as it labelled the firm 'Sharklays'.\\nWith thousands of police on security duty around the G7 hotel conference at the Carbis Bay hotel police chiefs are confident they will be able to stop any attempts to disrupt the meetings.\\nWith the road leading to the hotel and G7 accommodation at the Treganna Castle Hotel sealed off by metal barriers it is unlikely any protester will get within a mile of the venue.\\nExtinction Rebellion have instead called for a 'noisy protest' at a public park in Falmouth \u2013 at least 20 miles from Carbis Bay.\\nDemonstrators are expected to walk through the town centre banging drums and making as much noise as possible.\\nOther activities taking place include street theatre and a crime scene investigation with hazmat wearing protesters investigating a 'oil spill' at Custom House Quay in Falmouth.\\n", "image": [["Protesters projected slogans including 'protect the oceans not the politicians' onto ship moored off the coast of Cornwall - where G7 leaders gathered for a beach barbecue on Saturday night", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/12/23/44151805-9679291-image-a-223_1623537891113.jpg"], ["A group calling themselves Ocean Rebellion - in an apparent nod to activist group Extinction Rebellion which shut down London in 2019 - went out into the water in a small motorboat off Falmouth", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/12/23/44152577-9679291-image-a-220_1623537848121.jpg"], ["They projected words including 'as the sea dies we die' and 'protect the oceans not the politicians' onto a large ship, understood to be housing police officers", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/12/23/44152573-9679291-image-a-217_1623537774512.jpg"], ["Their vessel - which was dwarfed in comparison to the significantly larger ship moored beside them - had banners reading 'Ocean Rebellion' and 'seas rising'", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/12/23/44152575-9679291-image-a-222_1623537861805.jpg"], ["Boris and Carrie Johnson's one-year-old son Wilfred dazzled G7 leaders at a beach barbecue tonight, as Britain pulled out all the stops in a bid to woo the world's most powerful", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/12/21/44150207-9679815-image-a-280_1623531530364.jpg"], ["The youngster was seen toddling towards his mother in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, as other wives of world leaders - including First Lady Jill Biden - beamed at him", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/12/21/44150205-9679815-image-a-283_1623531555475.jpg"], ["Mrs Biden was among the group cooing over Wilfred, who joined his parents for the barbecue which featured locally-sourced seafood prepared by a nearby beach hut", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/12/21/44150203-9679815-image-a-285_1623531568308.jpg"], ["At the barbecue, some of the world's most-powerful men and women were treated to a breathtaking flypast by Red Arrows.

It's thought the Queen and her beloved husband last attended the royal race meeting together in 2017.\\nBut today the Queen, dressed in a glamorous mint coat with a matching hat, braved the grey weather to cheer on the four horses running in her colours of purple and gold.\\nStepping out to cheers and applause from the crowd, the Queen arrived at the Parade Ring in a beige car at 2pm wearing an eye-catching head piece featuring a bright pink floral design, teamed with her standard pearl accessories and a\u00a0diamond brooch.\\nHer horses Reach For The Moon, Tactical, Light Refrain and King's Lynn are all set to run during the afternoon.\\nPunters like to bet on the colour of the Queen's hat and this year bookmakers had said the most popular predictions were blue and green due to the change in weather.\\nNicola McGeady, of Ladbrokes, said: 'Green has been chalked up as the favourite, but red is the mover after money came earlier today.'\\nThe Queen's eldest grandson Peter Phillips was also seen arriving earlier in the day. The carriage procession that usually proceeds each day's racing did not take place.\\nUpon Her Majesty\u2019s arrival at the races, an army band belted out a rendition of the national anthem and the crowd roared its approval as she stepped from the car at the meeting she is so closely associated with.\\nHeir to the throne Prince Charles and his wife Camilla attended earlier in the week with Princess Anne also deputising for her mother.\\nThe monarch has watched the racing through the week from nearby Windsor Castle.

However, the Queen was notably absent.\\nHer Majesty's racing manager confirmed the monarch would not be attending on the first day but has been hoping that she would make it later in the week depending on 'how things go'.\\nThe Queen's racing manager John Warren told Radio 4: 'Obviously the Queen would love to attend.. and has been going to Ascot all of her adult life. So, it's a shame to miss an event.\\n'The plan at the moment is to see how it goes towards the latter part of the week and if the Queen's able to come because she's got runners, then, fingers crossed, it will happen.'\\nHe added that the monarch was 'fanatic' about horse racing, and called her energy levels 'incredible' despite her age.\\nHe said: 'It's remarkable.

I powdered myself in a makeshift dressing room as Gloria adjusted the spanx beneath her stunning dress.\\nNo presenters get any special treatment - we're all part of the team and it feels like we've become a little family.\\nTo relieve the tension as we posed for our full presenting team photo in the studio before going live, Simon McCoy jokingly massaged Andrew\u2019s back to help relieve the palpable tension.\\nAs the screens dotted around the newsroom counted down to zero, spontaneous applause erupted as Andrew uttered the words we\u2019d been waiting to hear: \u2018This is GB News, Britain\u2019s News Channel.\u2019\\nMy show Tonight Live launched the regular schedule at 9pm, with guests including anti-lockdown resistance hero Lord Sumption, cheeky Apprentice host Lord Alan Sugar, and Chinese virologist turned whistle-blower Li-Meng Yan.\\nFor the past six months I\u2019ve been one of 150 crazy, brave and very passionate folk at GB News attempting to launch a new 24-hour news network for the UK in the midst of a never-ending lockdown.\\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ve wanted to throw the remote control at the gogglebox this past year as increasingly woke news networks tell us what we should be thinking.\\nMy WTF moment was when Robert Peston announced on ITV News that he would never return to normal life again following the pandemic. Er, why?\\nBut maybe for you it was when ITV\u2019s Tom Bradby started acting as some sort of PR for the latest utterings of The Duke and Duchess of Woke Harry and Meghan in Californian exile.\\nOr when Beth Rigby of Sky News was relentlessly gunning for government ministers over minor Covid rule breaches, while living it up without a care for the guidance on Saturday nights herself.\\nMaybe the final straw has been C-list actor Adil Ray\u2019s relentless verbal bullying of anyone connected to the government on Good Morning Britain.\\nWhat\u2019s clear is that an alternative has been so desperately needed.\\nThere was one given about our first night: The snobby London metropolitan media elite were going to hate it \u2013 and, of course, they did.\\nBefore we broadcast a single second, the woke warriors on Twitter had launched a series of campaigns to try to defund and cancel us. If that doesn\u2019t sum up the madness of 2021\u2026\\nBut despite dealing with inevitable technical gremlins \u2013 we\u2019re launching an entire new broadcasting system on a tiny fraction of the budget of BBC, ITV or Sky \u2013 real Brits were overwhelmingly positive.\\nIn fact, my launch-night ratings peaked at 271,000 at 10pm, many times the audience of Sky News or the BBC News channel.\\nBut how many watched on TV is just a small part of the puzzle. The world has changed now \u2013 you can view us online or on your phone via an app. Soon GB News will be available to watch on YouTube and listen to on the wireless.\\nBut this is just the start of what I hope will be a broadcasting revolution in the UK, where presenters like me are honest about what we believe.\\nFree speech and democracy have been increasingly under attack over the last five years, nodded through by a monolithic bloc of privileged and out of touch Londoners who want to tell you what you should think.\\nThey completely missed the march towards Brexit and then did everything they could to try and stop it being delivered.\\nSo many debates about thorny issues have been shut down in the broadcast media, where woke producers proudly make decisions on what stories should be covered based on what matters to them, not you.\\nIn fact, often judgements can be made about what stories the media chooses NOT to cover.\\nWhy, for example, have the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky News devoted hours and hours to covering Black Lives Matters and Extinction Rebellion demonstrations, while declaring a near blackout on protests by those who oppose lockdowns.\\nThe BBC spent more on copies of the left-wing Guardian than any other newspaper, even though it\u2019s the least popular in the country.\\nWhat I hope GB News can do is bring you all the facts from all perspective, without censoring our guests.\\nI will always be honest and up front with you about my point of view, just like I am in my MailOnline columns.\\nI am proud to be an outsider.\\nI have never worked for any political party.\\nI\u2019m not friends with folk in Westminster and don\u2019t hang out with Carrie Johnson like so many other journalists who write about her husband.\\nI am completely independent and what I care about is fighting for the Brits so often ignored by the broadcast media in this country.\\nI want to give the silenced majority a voice again.\\nWhat on earth is there to feared from a balanced broadcaster that will feature all perspectives of the debate?\\nIn fact, that phrase \u2013 All Perspectives \u2013 is the name of the parent company of GB News for good reason.\\nI\u2019ll tell you what I do believe in and support: capitalism, genuine free speech, social liberties and respecting democracy. That\u2019s pretty basic, right?\\nMaking GB News a success is not going to be easy. There are a series of challenges that will be difficult to overcome.\\nBut we are collectively up for the fight.\\nI\u2019ve never professionally felt the buzz that existed in the GB News newsroom last night as the clock counted down for Andrew Neil to launch a manifesto for the new station in our studio, which is still under construction.\\nGB News will not be defined by one political viewpoint, no matter what our detractors say.\\nBut it will be defined by honest presenters sharing their genuine opinions and making judgements based on what viewers want, not what impresses their mates in the chattering classes at dinner parties.", "image": [["Over the past few weeks, the GB News team (pictured) has been rehearsing out a construction site as our state-of-the-art studio is put together", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/14/17/44211737-9685075-image-a-56_1623686653291.jpg"], ["England is one of the most tolerant and diverse countries in the world,writes Dan Wootton", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/09/15/44017405-9668689-image-a-32_1623247209863.jpg"], ["My launch-night ratings peaked at 271,000 at 10pm, many times the audience of Sky News or the BBC News channel", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/14/17/44211787-9685075-image-a-58_1623686751767.jpg"], ["Last night as the team of presenters poured in alongside guests like Nigel Farage (who admitted to quaffing a glass of fizz before going to air)", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/14/17/44211777-9685075-image-a-59_1623686759082.jpg"], ["What I hope GB News can do is bring you all the facts from all perspective, without censoring our guests", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/14/17/44211767-9685075-image-a-60_1623686788472.jpg"]], "author": ["Dan Wootton for MailOnline"], "date": "2021-06-14"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-9680341/SARAH-VINE-Oh-dont-frothy-woke-Boris.html": {"title": "SARAH VINE: Oh please don't go all frothy and woke on us now, Boris", "subtitle": ".", "text": "Like\u00a0many of my generation, I feel conflicted about this brave new woke world of ours. For example, when it comes to the trans debate, of course I want trans people to feel valued and secure in their lives. Why ever would I not?\\nEqually, I don't see why this has to happen at the expense of others, most notably women and impressionable young children who might make irreversible decisions they could later regret.\\nSimilarly, when it comes to footballers taking the knee, I get that they want to make a statement about eradicating racism, and I'm all in favour of that, too.\\nBut I also find the way that anyone who doesn't want to take part \u2013 perhaps because they are uncomfortable with the association with Black Lives Matter, which in America is a radical organisation with some highly dubious methods \u2013 gets branded as racist deeply unfair.\\nSo often, it seems, wokeness is just replacing one form of obnoxiousness with another, all \u2013 ironically \u2013 in the name of tolerance.\\nThis just doesn't make sense. Tolerance is about understanding and respecting the ideas of people you don't agree with, not threatening to ruin their lives if they don't agree with you.\\nTo me, that is in essence what wokeness signifies \u2013 and why I find so much of it exasperating. And why I think that, where appropriate and reasonable, it's important to push back.\\nSo I was a little concerned when, in his address at the G7, Boris Johnson kicked off with the kind of statement that made me wonder whether he'd hired Greta Thunberg as a speechwriter.\\nAppealing to his fellow leaders, he urged them to 'level up' by avoiding the mistakes made following the credit crunch of 2008, and expressed his passion for 'building back greener and building back fairer and building back more equal and in a more gender-neutral and, perhaps a more feminine way'.\\nAs my daughter would say, 'Sorry love?' For a start, it doesn't make sense. You can't be both more feminine and more gender-neutral. It's kind of an either/or situation.\\nBut also, et tu Boris? I would have thought that you, of all people, would be the last person to succumb to this kind of frothy-headed nonsense.\\nBecause make no mistake, this is textbook woke-speak. It expresses a variety of positive, empowering-sounding intentions, but it doesn't actually say anything useful or concrete.\\nThat is not the Boris we know and love and elected with a stonking majority. That Boris does not mince his words and, perhaps more importantly, that Boris gets stuff done.\\nHard stuff, such as Brexit and a vaccine rollout programme. He's a man of intergalactic ambition and appetites, and that's why people like him. If the country wanted some lily-livered appeaser, they'd elect Keir Starmer.\\nOf course it would be lovely if everything could be sunshine and rainbows. But that's all a bit of a way off because we are by no means out of this crisis. Britain needs a strong leader capable of making tough decisions.\\nBut perhaps more importantly, it needs a leader who stands up for common sense, who doesn't buy into this narrative that Britain is a horrible hellhole, who doesn't make the vast majority of good, ordinary people feel bad for not flagellating themselves day and night in pursuit of cultural purification.\\nOf all the Prime Ministers this nation has ever had, Boris probably more than any other represents the right to individual freedom, both in action, thought and expression.\\nHe has always been someone who has pushed the boundaries of an argument, who has never been afraid to stand up to a mob.\\nThe fact that even he now feels he has to dance attendance on the woke brigade is, to my mind at least, concerning. Let's hope it's just a passing fancy.\\nIf the British Army wasn't already a laughing stock for its 'Me me millennial' poster campaign in 2019, now it's sealed the deal by saying that recruits can skip training if they feel a cold coming on.\\nNot sure what the point is of a soldier who can't even fight off a sniffle, but I'm guessing Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping think it's a brilliant idea.\\nIf you extrapolate to its conclusion Harry's decision to take legal action against the BBC for saying he didn't get permission from the Queen before naming his daughter Lilibet, it might see him dragging his gran through the courts as a witness. Surely he can't be that far gone?\\nPrice of ignoring online porn\\nThis week's Ofsted report on sexual harassment in schools was grim reading. Behaviours unthinkable in my day have become 'normalised'.\\nRape jokes, up-skirting, the sharing of explicit photos, lewd conduct in class are routine; and more and more young girls are being asked \u2013 or in some cases forced \u2013 to perform extreme sex acts.\\nThe reason for this is quite simple to my mind: online pornography. Talk to any teenage girl and they all say the same thing: boys watch hardcore material from a very young age \u2013 in some cases while still at primary school \u2013 and it informs the way they not only view girls, but also how they see sex.\\nPornography is a world that humiliates and violates women yet successive governments have refused to do anything about it. Now we see the outcome: an entire generation corrupted and young people who maybe will never know the joy of ordinary, healthy relationships.\\nSociety wife swap\\nIt's\u00a0a high-class version of Wife Swap: Manhattan socialite twins Charlotte and Cecilia Bonstrom, 50, have seemingly swapped husbands \u2013 one a fashion house founder and the other an upmarket restaurateur. All very odd, not to mention a tad incestuous.\\nAlthough given how alike the sisters look, it might just be an embarrassing case of mistaken identity.\\nIf nothing else comes out of the G7, surely the one thing the leaders of the free world can agree on is that there has to be an immediate cessation to the ridiculous elbow bump greeting. They all look like utter plonkers. Well, even more like utter plonkers\u2026\\nFavourite G7 picture: the Duchess of Cornwall clutching a veritable vat of red wine while listening to the ocean-going bore that is Emmanuel Macron. Waiter!\\nNo crime like the present\\nAs someone\u00a0who was once tasked by Cabinet with choosing a leaving present for Theresa May after she resigned as PM, I know diplomatic gifting can be a minefield.\\nThat said, the fact the American people gave our Prime Minister a custom-made bicycle, while all we could manage was a photocopy of a picture off the internet, is unforgivable.\\nEven a bunch of petrol station flowers and a box of Celebrations would have been better.\\nIs it\u00a0just me, or does one get the impression that, after a few months that would have tried the patience of a saint, the Queen has finally had enough?\\nFirst, she tells the leaders of the G7 not to be so po-faced ('Are you supposed to look as if you're enjoying yourself?'); then, tasked with the fairly routine (for her) job of cutting a cake, she goes at it with a massive ceremonial sword on account of it being 'more unusual'.\\nUnusual? Since when has the Queen done anything unusual?\\nIf this is the kind of mood she's in, I can't wait for Prince Harry's next visit.\\nSpotted in Carbis Bay: an Extinction Rebellion protester wearing a football shirt emblazoned with 'Fly Emirates'. And they say irony is dead.\\nThe economy is bouncing back, according to figures which show GDP only 3.7 per cent below its pre-pandemic peak.\\nI'm not surprised: A friend recently tried to book a weekend away in a perfectly nice but not thrilling hotel in Cornwall: \u00a3900 a night, he was told. Is that why the Government seems determined to make it impossible to ever go abroad again?\\nChild marriage is despicable, so well done to Sajid Javid for his Bill calling for the minimum legal age for weddings to rise to 18.\\nI'd go one step further, and do something concrete to discourage unions between first cousins.\\nA study into child deaths in Bradford showed twice the risk of death from genetic and congenital abnormalities.\\nMy Labour council (Hammersmith & Fulham) has decided to stop cutting the grass in my local park on the grounds that 'it encourages bees and insects'. It also encourages hidden dog mess and other horrors.\\nWhy do I get the impression this is less about wildlife and more about skimping on basic public services?", "image": [["Boris Johnson kicked off with the kind of statement that made me wonder whether he'd hired Greta Thunberg as a speechwriter", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/12/22/44150773-9680341-image-m-35_1623532881477.jpg"], ["Appealing to his fellow leaders, he urged them to 'level up' by avoiding the mistakes made following the credit crunch of 2008", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/12/22/44150777-9680341-image-m-37_1623532915770.jpg"], ["Manhattan socialite twins Cecilia (left) and Charlotte Bonstrom (right), 50, have seemingly swapped husbands", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/12/22/44150931-9680341-image-m-39_1623533123250.jpg"]], "author": ["Sarah Vine For The Mail On Sunday"], "date": "2021-06-12"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/spain/article-9689999/Greenpeace-parachutist-smashes-spidercam-wires-France-Germany-stadium-Euro-2020-game.html": {"title": "Two spectators are hospitalised with head injuries in botched Greenpeace stunt horror at France-Germany game as paraglider protesting against VW hits spidercam wires and hurtles into stands", "subtitle": "Greenpeace protester lost control during a paragliding stunt at last night's Germany-France game in Munich.
