Up to 572 women inmates can be held at the Category A jail across four houseblocks which can hold about 130 people in each one.\\nEach wing has a servery unit for women to collect their food, which they can either eat together on the wing or take it back to their rooms. Telephones are also provided in each room. It has a 17-bed healthcare facility, and a mother and baby unit for 12 women and 13 babies up to the age of 18 months.\\nWhen a woman arrives at the prison they are searched and their welfare assessed by a doctor and nurse. They also receive a meal and drink, before beginning an induction process the following day. Notable former inmates include murderer Rose West, child abuser Vanessa George and the Labour MP Fiona Onasanya.\\nA study in July 2016 by HM Inspectorate of Prisons found prisoners were normally offered about five options for lunch and the same for dinner. A typical prison lunch consisted of a sandwich, wrap or portion of pasta, served with a piece of fruit or crisps and biscuits. Typical dinners included a choice of curry, pie, baked fish or casserole, accompanied by rice, vegetables, potatoes, and a choice of dessert or fruit such as apples and oranges.\\nThe most recent report of\u00a0Bronzefield by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons in 2018 said many inmates were facing 'significant mental health problems', 'self-harm among prisoners remained high' and 'violent incidents had increased significantly over the previous four years' - but concluded that it was an 'overwhelmingly safe prison'.\\nBut another report released two months ago found an 18-year-old inmate who lost her baby at the jail in 2019 should never have given birth alone in her cell. The probe found the mother, known as Ms A, pressed her cell bell twice and asked for a nurse but nobody came.\u00a0One hour later a prison officer shone a torch into her cell but said there was nothing out of the ordinary. But the inmate said she was on all fours at the time and described being in constant pain, before passing out then awaking to find her daughter had been born but was not breathing.\\nThe male Insulate Britain protesters have gone to Category B HMP Pentonville - known as 'The Ville' - in Islington, North London, which houses about 1,300 men who live in a mixture of single and shared rooms over seven wings.\\nSmart, a\u00a0biologist, told the High Court in London this week that the court proceedings were 'obscene' and glowered at barristers representing National Highways.\u00a0However, she has faced allegations of hypocrisy after undertaking a gas-guzzling 81,000-mile drive across the globe with her husband Andy Smith in 2012.\\nMr Smith, 45, who volunteers\u00a0as a climate activist full time but has not taken part in any demonstrations with Extinction Rebellion offshoot Insulate Britain, said he is 'terrified' for her. Mr Smith said he was aware that Smart would be going on a hunger strike if she was put behind bars, adding: 'It's something we discuss quite frequently'.\\nHe added: 'She is incredibly resolute in her actions.\u00a0I stand by her in all the decisions she makes. Morally they are in the right in this instance and she really stands by her convictions. She's an incredibly passionate person who has spent her whole entire adult life trying to save wildlife and protect the environment.\\n'That's deeply ingrained in who she is. That freedom to go out on to the street and protest has been taken away from her, so her going on a hunger strike in prison is another way to continue that process.\\n'All nine of them in court today were pretty resolute that you can sentence them, but this isn't going to resolve the problem and people will still continue to protest. Obviously I'm terrified. It's a horrible thing for her to go through but I stand by her decision to do that. It's (going on hunger strike) something we discuss quite frequently, the different ways we can make sacrifices to highlight injustices. I'm aware that she had previously talked to other people who've already done hunger strikes and been on hunger strikes. She's a scientist, she's done her research.'\\nHe added that the sentences were less than the supporters of the group were expecting so they were 'relieved', but still felt it was a 'complete injustice'. He said:\u00a0'I completely stand with them on what they've done and how they've acted. I would obviously rather the judge side with them but they did break the law and then they were willing to face the consequences of breaking the law.'\\nAnnouncing her intention to go on hunger strike after being jailed, Smart said: 'Our Government is betraying us, betraying our vulnerable people and betraying our children's future.\u00a0I believe that my intentions are morally right, even if my actions are deemed legally wrong.\u00a0 This court may see me as being on the wrong side of the law, but in my heart I know I am on the right side of history. I will not be a bystander.'\\nFollowing two months of motorway chaos caused by Insulate Britain,\u00a0Smart told the court that she was there to 'ensure future survival' and compared watching the climate crisis to watching a child trapped in a burning house.\\n'She said:\u00a0'I'm asking when you consider my sentence that my actions are proportionate to the crisis we are facing, where 8,500 people die a year from cold and hunger in their own homes.\u00a0I cannot stand by and watch.\\n'I would run to them. Our Government is betraying us, our vulnerable people and our children's future.\u00a0I will not be a bystander while our Government fails and betrays its people, I will continue to do what is necessary.'\\nEco protester Smart and her husband drove 80,975 miles in 858 days in an 18-year-old Toyota during the world tour from 2012 to 2016.\\nAhead of her trip in 2012, Smart told BBC: 'It's a massive scale it's taken 18 months of planning and saving and we are working extremely hard but here we are now about to set off and it's all very real.'\\n\\nHMP BRONZEFIELD\\nAna Heyatawin, 58, and Emma Smart, 44, have both been sent to HMP Bronzefield after being jailed.\\nThe jail in Ashford, Surrey, was Britain's first purpose-built prison for women when it opened in June 2004, as well as being the 10th privately-run prison in England.\\nUp to 572 women inmates can be held at the Category A jail across four houseblocks which can hold about 130 women in each one. Each wing has a servery unit for women to collect their food, which they can either eat together on the wing or take back to their rooms. Telephones are also provided in each room. It has a 17-bed healthcare facility, and a mother and baby unit for 12 women and 13 babies up to the age of 18 months.\\nWhen a woman arrives at the prison they will be searched and their welfare assessed by a doctor and nurse. They will also receive a meal and drink, before beginning an induction process the following day.\\nNotable former inmates at\u00a0Bronzefield include murderers Rose West and Joanna Dennehy, child abuser Vanessa George and the Labour MP Fiona Onasanya.\\nHMP PENTONVILLE\\nLouis McKechnie, 20, Ben Buse, 36, Roman Paluch-Machnik, 28, Oliver Rock, 41, Tim Speers, 36, James Thomas, 47, and Ben Taylor, 37, have all be taken to HMP Pentonville after being jailed at the High Court.\\nThe Category B jail - known as 'The Ville' - in Islington, North London, houses about 1,300 men who live in a mixture of single and shared rooms across seven wings.\\nWhen a prisoner first arrives they are allowed to contact one relative by phone and see a medical professional about any immediate health and wellbeing needs.\\nThey then have a four-day induction period to explain the prison rules, and education opportunities. A service provided by Novus lets them study for qualifications in subjects such as carpentry, food safety and painting.\\nThe jail also has four gym areas and a multi-faith chaplaincy service and works with the Catch 22 organisation which helps prisoners involved in gangs.\\nNotable former inmates over the last 40 years include footballers George Best and Nile Ranger; singers George Michael and Pete Doherty; and actor Keith Allen.\\nThe couple broke their global trip into four phases and regularly blogged about their travelS inside their 4x4.\\nThe first leg of their trip saw them travel to France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Mongolia, Russia, Ukraine and Poland.\\nThis was followed by visits to Portugal, Morocco, Western Sahara, Spain and Andorra.\\nThe couple also travelled to Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Italy, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro and Kosova along their world expedition.\\nWhen news of the trip emerged in October, critics branded it a sign of 'hypocrisy at its very finest'.\\nInsulate Britain began a wave of protests on September 13, demanding that the Government makes plans to insulate the UK's homes.\\nThey blocked roads around London as well as in Birmingham, Manchester and Dover - causing miles of tailbacks in rush hour.\\nThe nine eco-zealots were jailed over a protest on October 8 at Waltham Cross in Hertfordshire which saw a total of 16 people arrested - but dozens more activists are set to be issued with\u00a0committal proceedings in the next few days.\\nThe group and its supporters chanted 'We are unstoppable, another world is possible' as they were led to the cells through the dock by security officers at the court in London.\\nHeyatawin and McKechnie were both jailed for three months while Buse, Paluch-Machnik, Rock, Smart, Speers and Thomas all received four-month sentences.\\nThe shorter jail term for Heyatawin was because of her medical issues, while\u00a0McKechnie's was due to his younger age. The men will be at Category B Pentonville jail in Islington and the women at Category A Bronzefield in Surrey.\\nInsulate Britain said the protesters were expected to serve at least half of their sentence. They had been facing a maximum penalty of two years in prison or an unlimited fine for contempt of court.\\nThe demonstrations have seen the campaigners glue themselves to the road before being removed by police.\u00a0At least 174 activists have been involved on 19 days of protests so far and there have been 860 arrests.\\nGroup spokesman Tracey Mallaghan said after the case: 'The right thing to do is highlight injustice, breaking the law if needed. This is what the Suffragettes did and Martin Luther King did, and it is what Insulate Britain has done.'\\nIt comes after Taylor told the court on Tuesday that if he was not in jail he would 'go and block the motorway at the earliest opportunity and will continue to do so until the Government makes a meaningful statement and acts on it'.\\nTaylor's submissions were described yesterday by Dame Victoria Sharp as 'inflammatory' and a 'call to arms', and he was therefore given a longer sentence of six months 'to deter (him) from committing further breaches'.\\nThe judge, sitting with Mr Justice Chamberlain, said there was no alternative to jail sentences given the group's actions were so serious and they had made it clear they intended to further flout court orders.\\nShe said: 'The defendants, or some of them, seem to want to be martyrs for their cause and the media campaign surrounding this hearing appears designed to suggest this. We, however, have to act dispassionately and proportionately.'\\nFOUL-MOUTHED RANTER - Ben Taylor: 6 months\\nDefiant Taylor, 27, was handed the longest sentence for what judges called an 'inflammatory' call to arms, in which he told the court that the government must 'f****ing act' on the group's demands. He also boasted that he would immediately go out and block another road if he was not jailed.. The court therefore extended his detention 'to deter Mr Taylor from committing further breaches'.\\nDEVOUT CHRISTIAN - Dr Benjamin Buse: 4 months\\nThe meek University of Bristol researcher, 36, was the only defendant to have a barrister representing his interests. The court was told that Dr Buse, who has published on topics like 'microanalysis of Uranium', was a devout Christian and popular member of his local church in Cheddar. Barrister Owen Greenhall said he volunteered for charity and donated hundreds of pounds to good causes every month.\\nTHE REBEL SCARED OF JAIL - Oliver Rock: 4 months\\nThe 41-year-old carpenter from south London, admitted he was 'c**pping himself' about going to jail and enjoyed drawn-out cinches with his partner before the final hearing began. He said that after feeling 'depressed' that the 2003 Iraq War march had failed, he was inspired to take up more extreme tactics, in collaboration with Extinction Rebellion, which he joined in 2019. He told the court he only earned about \u00a310,000 a year, often making 'small stage sets'.\\nHUNGER STRIKER - Emma Smart: 4 months\\nThe 44-year-old, from Weymouth, announced via an Insulate Britain spokesman that she would be going on hunger strike. She told the court that the proceedings were 'obscene' and glowered at barristers representing National Highways. But Smart, a biologist, has previously been criticised for undertaking a gas-guzzling 81,000-mile drive across the globe with her partner, Andy.\\nSTUDENT AGED ONLY 21 - Louis McKechnie: 3 months\\nThe student from Weymouth, who turned 21 yesterday, was given a month off his sentence in recognition of his youth. He said his only income was his student loan, which all went on living expenses, so he would struggle to pay his share of the bill in paying the government's legal costs.\\nTHE OLDEST DEFENDANT - Ana Heyatawin: 3 months\\nThe oldest of the defendants, the blue-haired 58-year-old from Wells, had her sentence reduced to three months, after she told the court about her litany of health issues, including a personality disorder, depression, sciatica and bad eyesight.\\n'ENLIGHTENED CAPITALIST' - James Thomas: 4 months\\nThe 47-year-old architect said he had previously regarded himself as an 'enlightened capitalist sort of guy', but was inspired to abandon his career and join protest movements after seeing a film about the successes won by the Suffragettes and their campaign of direct action. He said that the 'scariest part' of his time inside would be the impact on his relationship.\\nINSPIRED BY GRANDPARENTS - Roman Paluch-Machnik: 4 months\\nThe 28-year-old from Ealing said that learning about the experiences of his grandparents, all four of whom escaped Poland during the war, had helped inspire his activism. An active member of Extinction Rebellion since 2018, he has travelled the country giving talks on climate change and training others how to participate in 'Non-Violent Direct Action'.\\n'SANE IN AN INSANE WORLD' - Tim Speers: 4 months\\nThe 36-year-old, from east London, pontificated in court, 'in an insane world, the sane will be seen as insane'. He believes that Insulate Britain has led 'one of the most successful campaigns in history'. He was first arrested on Waterloo Bridge in 2019 at an Extinction Rebellion protest, commenting: 'I refuse sit back while greed and ignorance takes life to extinction.'\\nBefore the group were sentenced, the National Highways barrister said the legal costs of bringing proceedings against the nine activists had reached \u00a391,000. She argued the judges should make an order for the costs against the defendants and that, even if they are unable to pay them, such an order would be an 'important symbol'.\\nShe also said the agency had a duty to attempt to recover the costs, as they are from public funds. But\u00a0Dame Victoria Sharp said she and Mr Justice Chamberlain will give their decision on costs in writing at a later date.\\nThe nine activists said they did not have the funds to pay their share of the legal costs. Taylor said he has been volunteering for a couple of years and is currently claiming Universal Credit, which has recently been cut. He added: '\u00a310,000 is a lot of money so unless there is a deadline, it will take a long time to pay off.'\\nSmart told the court she has been working as a volunteer in wildlife conservation and climate activism, and does not have any money. Addressing National Highways' legal team, she said: 'You are claiming more for postage than I have earned in the last three years. The fact you are profiting from our stand and trying to save the lives of ... people is obscene. Take what I have, come to my house and sell my clothes because that's all I have.'\\nRock said he is a carpenter and was badly affected by the pandemic as he built theatre sets, while Speers said he was a full-time volunteer and claims Universal Credit. Speers added: 'I might be dead before I can pay these costs.'\\nA further 23 protesters have also defied one or more of several injunctions granted to Transport for London and National Highways over the past two months. And Insulate Britain said it expects these 23 people to be summoned in the coming days, which would bring the total to at least 32 people who are due to face contempt of court.\\nLawyers representing the Government said further committal proceedings will be issued against other Insulate Britain protesters and were expected to be brought by the end of the week, relating to protests on October 27. Evidence is also being gathered to bring proceedings in relation to protests on October 29 and November 2.\\nRaj Chada, solicitor at Hodge Jones and Allen law firm which supported the protesters, said: 'With these prison terms, the long and honourable tradition of civil disobedience is under attack again.\\n'Rather than leaving courts to imprison those that raise the alarm, it should be the Government that acts to protect us against the climate crisis.'\\nThe group has insisted it intends to continue with the protests until the Government agrees to insulate homes.\\nDame Victoria told the court that police bodycam footage of the protest showed officers struggling to remove the demonstrators from the road.\\nThe court heard the activists moved towards oncoming traffic before some successfully glued themselves on the road after being told to clear.\\nThe judge said: 'The footage shows a somewhat chaotic scene with the defendants very close to traffic, and in some instances moving traffic, and the police attempting to restrain them from continuing with their protest and re-entering the road.'\\nDame Victoria Sharp told the activists that it is 'integral' that orders made by the court 'must be obeyed'. She said: 'In our democratic society, all citizens are equal under the law and all are subject to the law.\\n'It is integral to the rule of law, and to the fair and peaceful resolution of disputes, first, that orders made by the court must be obeyed, unless and until they are set aside or subject to successful challenge on appeal, and secondly that a mechanism exists to enforce orders made by court against those who breach them.\\n'In this jurisdiction, that mechanism is provided by the law of contempt.'\\nInsulate Britain activists were also told by the judge that ordinary members of the public 'have rights too'.\\nDame Victoria Sharp told them: 'In a democratic society which recognises the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, protests causing some degree of inconvenience are to be expected and, up to a point, tolerated.\\n'But the words 'up to a point' are important. Ordinary members of the public have rights too, including the right to use the highways.\\n'The public's toleration of peaceful protest depends on an understanding that, in a society subject to the rule of law, the balance between the protesters' right to protest and the right of members of the public to use the highways is to be determined not by the say-so of the protesters, but according to the law.'\\nThe judge also said the public has an 'interest in deterring disobedience to its orders and in upholding the rule of law'.\\nAnd Buse said in a statement: 'Care for the earth and all life requires me to act. My faith requires me to act, believing in the sacredness of creation and the demand for justice, justice for the trampled and exploited.\\n'Whilst acknowledging the importance of the courts, I have continued to break the injunction multiple times for we have a duty to the earth, to life, to future generations, to care and protect, this is the most important function of government, society and law.\\n'As we enter into the difficult years shifting to low carbon, and feeling the effects of climate change, we all need to be engaged in peaceful transformation; attempts to punish and crack down on peaceful protest opens the door to violent protest, which I deeply wish to avoid.'\\nSpeers added: 'Never before has a civilisation had the burden and the privilege to see its own collapse coming.\\n'In this world, those trying to avert catastrophe are vilified and criminalised, and those profiting from death are protected and rewarded. We asked for a chance to live. That's all.\\n'We did so in the tradition of non-violent protest upon which this country was built. In response, the Government declared it would do 'everything we can to stop them'.'\\n'In an insane world, the sane will be seen as insane. And in a democracy steeped in lies and corruption, good people have a duty to disobey bad laws.\\n\\n'We did our duty and I await the day when a judge in a court of law is brave enough to do theirs.'\\nAn Insulate Britain spokesman said yesterday: 'This morning our Insulate Britain supporters have been sentenced. We are being failed and betrayed by our government. Our nine chose not to standby and be complicit in genocide.'\\nAfter today's sentencing an Insulate Britain supporter read out the following letter in court, which said:\\n'Over the last nine weeks, 174 ordinary people have held the government to account, asking that they deliver on their most basic of duties, to protect the British people, the economy and all we hold dear in our society. Your government has now chosen to act. It has chosen to imprison us for this demand.\\n'By imprisoning us, the government shows its cowardice. They would rather lock up pensioners than insulate their homes. They would rather lock up teachers than create thousands of proper jobs.\\n'They would rather lock up young people than take practical steps to reduce emissions. They will lock us up and leave thousands to die of cold this winter. We knew we would face prison when we took this action, but we could not stand by while the government betrays the general public.\\n'Following the widely recognised failure of our government at COP26, we are continuing to ask them to get on with the job: of cutting carbon emissions; of insulating cold and leaky houses; of protecting the people of this country from climate collapse, because the lives of our children and those of all future generations hang in the balance.\\n'To the government we say, you can't imprison a flood, there are no unlimited fines against a famine, you can't bankrupt a fire.\\n'To the public we say, no one is coming to save you. In the past, when governments have failed to protect their people the right thing to do is to highlight this injustice, breaking the law if needed, this is what the suffragettes and Martin Luther King did and it is what Insulate Britain has done.\\n'We call on you to recognise that you also have a duty to act, as our government is betraying us. They can't even act to insulate Britain. What hope do we have of them protecting our children, our economy or our country?\\n'We say to those who look on in fear and denial: this will impact you and all that you love and look at what we did. A few hundred people captured the country's attention for months. Think what 1000 people can achieve? You have a choice. To act, to come and join us help change the tide of history, or to be a bystander and be complicit in enabling genocide. This tide will not come again, will you join us?'\\nDuring Tuesday's hearing, Taylor said if he was 'not put in prison' for breaching an injunction banning disruptive protests on the nation's roads, he will 'go and block the motorway at the earliest opportunity and will continue to do so until the Government makes a meaningful statement and acts on it'.\\nHe added that 'whatever sentence or sanction' he was given 'will be counter-productive and will only serve to fuel the campaign of Insulate Britain'.\\nTaylor said: 'If you send me away to prison, ten people will step forward in my place. If you send each of us away, 100 people will step forward and take our places. If you send 100 of us away, 1,000 people will step forward to take our place.\\n'If you somehow manage to stop all non-violent protests, then things will only turn violent.'\\nSpeers described the country's democracy as 'steeped in lies' and said 'good people have a duty to breach bad laws'.\\nHe said: 'In this world, those trying to avert catastrophe are vilified. On a tradition of non-violent protest, in response, the Government said they will 'do everything to we can to stop them.'\\n'That was from Grant Shapps, who had a second job under another name.'\\nPaluch-Machnik told the court the injunction 'is not just in context with the crisis we're in'.\\nHe said: 'The Government would rather imprison pensioners than insulate their homes.'\\nMr Paluch said retrofitting homes is the cheapest way to tackle the climate crisis and added: 'We are asking for a fully funded state-operated retrofitted service, like the NHS.\\n'Some of those who have spoken have said they're not afraid. I'm afraid you will take away my home and me away from my friends, family and partner.\\n'But I'm more afraid of inaction and the climate catastrophe that has already began to crash on some of us. I stand by the action that brought me before this court, and if that sends me to prison, then so be it.'\\nHe urged the court to look at 'more than the letter of the law' and 'make the commitment to insulate Britain'.\\nHeyatawin told the High Court she is 'traumatised' by the Government's attitude to climate change.\\nShe said she 'does not accept the morality of the injunction' and said 'it is meaningless in the context of climate collapse'.\\nMs Heyatawin added: 'I know how to behave. I think I'm a good person. I felt compelled to stop the world and get off. We are hurtling towards ecocide, genocide and our own suicide.'\\nRock invited the court to observe a minute's silence 'to imagine what the climate crisis means for the future'.\u00a0 He said: 'I'm proud of our actions and I stand by what we have done, we have not done this for personal gain.\\n'I take responsibility for my actions and I did that in an attempt to mitigate the suffering of people in this country who cannot afford to adequately heat their homes.'\\nThe only defendant to have a lawyer was Dr Ben Buse, a Bristol University researcher. Owen Greenhall told the court Dr Buse was active in his local church and a highly regarded member of the community.\\nMyriam Stacey QC, representing National Highways, told the court the message that the defendants are 'proud of their conduct' and 'will continue to defy the injunction order made' is 'loud and clear'.\\nShe added: 'No apology has been made in relation to the breach of the order.'\\nMs Stacey said the group had emailed National Highways in September saying the protests would continue 'unless the Government make a meaningful statement that they will start the process of decarbonising homes in Britain'.\\nMs Stacey said further committal proceedings will be issued against other Insulate Britain protesters by the end of the week, relating to protests on October 27.\\nShe also said evidence is being gathered to bring proceedings in relation to protests on October 29 and November 2. All nine defendants were sentenced by Dame Victoria Sharp and Mr Justice Chamberlain.\\n'Contempt of court' is an offence that normally happens when someone risks unfairly influencing a court case, which may stop somebody from getting a fair trial.\\nIt can include taking photos or shouting out in court, refusing to answer questions as a witness or publicly commenting on a court case such as on social media.\\nAnother form it takes is disobeying or ignoring a court order, which is what the Insulate Britain activists have done by breaking an injunction on their M25 protests.\\nThose who breach the injunctions were found in contempt of court and could have faced a maximum penalty of two years in prison or an unlimited fine. In the end, they were jailed for between three and six months.\\nThe High Court has so far issued five injunctions to prevent protesters from blocking roads - four to National Highways and one to Transport for London (TfL).\\nThe hearings did not taking place in a criminal court because none of the protesters have been charged with a criminal offence by police. This is despite at least 161 activists having been involved in the demonstrations over the two months, resulting in at least 860 arrests.\\nThe protesters were instead facing contempt of court proceedings for breaching a High Court injunction, which is a civil matter but can still result in a jail term.\\nAn emotional Mr Rock told LBC radio on Tuesday: 'I feel terrified - I'm c***ping myself this morning, and I feel like crying. I've got all these emotions coming out of me. It seems ridiculous that we're in this situation.\\n'What we're asking the Government to do is just an extremely practical no-brainer thing that they should be doing, and they're choosing instead to potentially lock us up, fine us, seize our assets.\\n'I'm expecting that we might get sentenced maybe today, probably tomorrow. We've been told that quite probably we'll get custodial sentences, so there's a high likelihood that by this evening I'll be in a prison cell somewhere.'\\nThe Government plans to introduce new measures to clamp down on protests, including allowing police to stop and search people where there is a reasonable suspicion they are carrying items intended to cause disturbance, such as glue.\\nAfter yesterday's sentencing a\u00a0statement from the nine activists jailed was read by an Insulate Britain supporter outside the Royal Courts of Justice.\\nIt read: 'Over the last nine weeks, 174 ordinary people have held the Government to account, asking that they deliver on their most basic of duties, to protect the British people, the economy and all we hold dear in our society.\\n'Your Government has now chosen to act. It has chosen to imprison us for this demand.\\n'By imprisoning us, the Government shows its cowardice.

She's not in a critical condition.'\\nIt comes as the group today released a statement on behalf of the jailed eco-activist.\\nSpeaking from prison, she said: 'The window of my cell in the hospital wing is blocked up and there is little natural light, in my previous cell I could see the birds and trees that line the prison fence.\\nHMP Bronzefield in Ashford, Surrey, was Britain's first purpose-built prison for women when it opened in 2004. Up to 572 women inmates can be held at the Category A jail across four houseblocks which can hold about 130 people in each one.\\nEach wing has a servery unit for women to collect their food, which they can either eat together on the wing or take it back to their rooms. Telephones are also provided in each room. It has a 17-bed healthcare facility, and a mother and baby unit for 12 women and 13 babies up to the age of 18 months.\\nWhen a woman arrives at the prison they are searched and their welfare assessed by a doctor and nurse. They also receive a meal and drink, before beginning an induction process the following day. Notable former inmates include murderer Rose West, child abuser Vanessa George and the Labour MP Fiona Onasanya.\\nA study in July 2016 by HM Inspectorate of Prisons found prisoners were normally offered about five options for lunch and the same for dinner. A typical prison lunch consisted of a sandwich, wrap or portion of pasta, served with a piece of fruit or crisps and biscuits. Typical dinners included a choice of curry, pie, baked fish or casserole, accompanied by rice, vegetables, potatoes, and a choice of dessert or fruit such as apples and oranges.\\nThe most recent report of Bronzefield by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons in 2018 said many inmates were facing 'significant mental health problems', 'self-harm among prisoners remained high' and 'violent incidents had increased significantly over the previous four years' - but concluded that it was an 'overwhelmingly safe prison'.\\nBut another report released two months ago found an 18-year-old inmate who lost her baby at the jail in 2019 should never have given birth alone in her cell. The probe found the mother, known as Ms A, pressed her cell bell twice and asked for a nurse but nobody came. One hour later a prison officer shone a torch into her cell but said there was nothing out of the ordinary.

He also boasted that he would immediately go out and block another road if he was not jailed.. The court therefore extended his detention 'to deter Mr Taylor from committing further breaches'.\\nDEVOUT CHRISTIAN - Dr Benjamin Buse: 4 months\\nThe meek University of Bristol researcher, 36, was the only defendant to have a barrister representing his interests. The court was told that Dr Buse, who has published on topics like 'microanalysis of Uranium', was a devout Christian and popular member of his local church in Cheddar. Barrister Owen Greenhall said he volunteered for charity and donated hundreds of pounds to good causes every month.\\nTHE REBEL SCARED OF JAIL - Oliver Rock: 4 months\\nThe 41-year-old carpenter from south London, admitted he was 'c**pping himself' about going to jail and enjoyed drawn-out cinches with his partner before the final hearing began. He said that after feeling 'depressed' that the 2003 Iraq War march had failed, he was inspired to take up more extreme tactics, in collaboration with Extinction Rebellion, which he joined in 2019. He told the court he only earned about \u00a310,000 a year, often making 'small stage sets'.\\nHUNGER STRIKER - Emma Smart: 4 months\\nThe 44-year-old, from Weymouth, announced via an Insulate Britain spokesman that she would be going on hunger strike.

But Smart, a biologist, has previously been criticised for undertaking a gas-guzzling 81,000-mile drive across the globe with her partner, Andy.\\nSTUDENT AGED ONLY 21 - Louis McKechnie: 3 months\\nThe student from Weymouth, who turned 21 yesterday, was given a month off his sentence in recognition of his youth. He said his only income was his student loan, which all went on living expenses, so he would struggle to pay his share of the bill in paying the government's legal costs.\\nTHE OLDEST DEFENDANT - Ana Heyatawin: 3 months\\nThe oldest of the defendants, the blue-haired 58-year-old from Wells, had her sentence reduced to three months, after she told the court about her litany of health issues, including a personality disorder, depression, sciatica and bad eyesight.\\n'ENLIGHTENED CAPITALIST' - James Thomas: 4 months\\nThe 47-year-old architect said he had previously regarded himself as an 'enlightened capitalist sort of guy', but was inspired to abandon his career and join protest movements after seeing a film about the successes won by the Suffragettes and their campaign of direct action. He said that the 'scariest part' of his time inside would be the impact on his relationship.\\nINSPIRED BY GRANDPARENTS - Roman Paluch-Machnik: 4 months\\nThe 28-year-old from Ealing said that learning about the experiences of his grandparents, all four of whom escaped Poland during the war, had helped inspire his activism.

Heyatawin and McKechnie were both jailed for three months while Buse, Paluch-Machnik, Rock, Smart, Speers and Thomas all received four-month sentences.\\nThe shorter jail term for Heyatawin was because of her medical issues, while\u00a0McKechnie's was due to his younger age. The men will be at Category B Pentonville jail in Islington and the women at Category A Bronzefield in Surrey. Insulate Britain is an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, which today described those jailed as the 'Highway Nine'.\\nAfter the sentencing, Smart insisted that she would go on hunger strike in prison.\u00a0Insulate Britain began a wave of protests on September 13, demanding that the Government makes plans to insulate the UK's homes. They blocked roads around London as well as in Birmingham, Manchester and Dover - causing miles of tailbacks in rush hour.\\nThe demonstrations have seen the campaigners glue themselves to the road before being removed by police.\u00a0At least 174 activists have been involved on 19 days of protests so far and there have been 860 arrests.\\nGroup spokesman Tracey Mallaghan said after the case: 'The right thing to do is highlight injustice, breaking the law if needed. This is what the Suffragettes did and Martin Luther King did, and it is what Insulate Britain has done.'\\nIt comes after Taylor told the court yesterday that if he was not in jail he would 'go and block the motorway at the earliest opportunity and will continue to do so until the Government makes a meaningful statement and acts on it'.\\nTaylor's submissions were described today by Dame Victoria Sharp as 'inflammatory' and a 'call to arms', and he was therefore given a longer sentence of six months 'to deter (him) from committing further breaches'.\\nThe judge, sitting with Mr Justice Chamberlain, said there was no alternative to jail sentences given the group's actions were so serious and they had made it clear they intended to further flout court orders. She said: 'The defendants, or some of them, seem to want to be martyrs for their cause and the media campaign surrounding this hearing appears designed to suggest this. We, however, have to act dispassionately and proportionately.'\\nBefore the group were sentenced, the National Highways barrister said the legal costs of bringing proceedings against the nine activists had reached \u00a391,000. She argued the judges should make an order for the costs against the defendants and that, even if they are unable to pay them, such an order would be an 'important symbol'.\\nShe also said the agency had a duty to attempt to recover the costs, as they are from public funds. But\u00a0Dame Victoria Sharp said she and Mr Justice Chamberlain will give their decision on costs in writing at a later date.\\nThe nine activists said they did not have the funds to pay their share of the legal costs. Taylor said he has been volunteering for a couple of years and is currently claiming Universal Credit, which has recently been cut. He added: '\u00a310,000 is a lot of money so unless there is a deadline, it will take a long time to pay off.'\\nSmart told the court she has been working as a volunteer in wildlife conservation and climate activism, and does not have any money. Addressing National Highways' legal team, she said: 'You are claiming more for postage than I have earned in the last three years. The fact you are profiting from our stand and trying to save the lives of ... people is obscene. Take what I have, come to my house and sell my clothes because that's all I have.'\\nRock said he is a carpenter and was badly affected by the pandemic as he built theatre sets, while Speers said he was a full-time volunteer and claims Universal Credit. Speers added: 'I might be dead before I can pay these costs.'\\nA further 23 protesters have also defied one or more of several injunctions granted to Transport for London and National Highways over the past two months. And Insulate Britain said it expects these 23 people to be summoned in the coming days, which would bring the total to at least 32 people who are due to face contempt of court.\\nLawyers representing the Government said further committal proceedings will be issued against other Insulate Britain protesters and were expected to be brought by the end of the week, relating to protests on October 27. Evidence is also being gathered to bring proceedings in relation to protests on October 29 and November 2.\\nRaj Chada, solicitor at Hodge Jones and Allen law firm which supported the protesters, said: 'With these prison terms, the long and honourable tradition of civil disobedience is under attack again. Rather than leaving courts to imprison those that raise the alarm, it should be the Government that acts to protect us against the climate crisis.'\\nInsulate Britain said the protesters were expected to serve at least half of their sentence. They had been facing a maximum penalty of two years in prison or an unlimited fine for contempt of court.\\nThe group has insisted it intends to continue with the protests until the Government agrees to insulate homes.\\nBen Taylor: 6 months\\nDefiant Taylor, 27, was handed the longest sentence for what judges called an 'inflammatory' call to arms, in which he told the court that the government must 'f****ing act' on the group's demands. He also boasted that he would immediately go out and block another road if he was not jailed.. The court therefore extended his detention 'to deter Mr Taylor from committing further breaches'.\\nDr Benjamin Buse: 4 months\\nThe meek University of Bristol researcher, 36, was the only defendant to have a barrister representing his interests.

She told the court that the proceedings were 'obscene' and glowered at barristers representing National Highways. But Smart, a biologist, has previously been criticised for undertaking a gas-guzzling 81,000-mile drive across the globe with her partner, Andy.\\nLouis McKechnie: 3 months\\nThe student from Weymouth, who turned 21 yesterday, was given a month off his sentence in recognition of his youth. He said his only income was his student loan, which all went on living expenses, so he would struggle to pay his share of the bill in paying the government's legal costs.\\nAna Heyatawin: 3 months\\nThe oldest of the defendants, the blue-haired 58-year-old from Wells, had her sentence reduced to three months, after she told the court about her litany of health issues, including a personality disorder, depression, sciatica and bad eyesight.\\nJames Thomas: 4 months\\nThe 47-year-old architect said he had previously regarded himself as an 'enlightened capitalist sort of guy', but was inspired to abandon his career and join protest movements after seeing a film about the successes won by the Suffragettes and their campaign of direct action.

He believes that Insulate Britain has led 'one of the most successful campaigns in history'. He was first arrested on Waterloo Bridge in 2019 at an Extinction Rebellion protest, commenting: 'I refuse sit back while greed and ignorance takes life to extinction.'\\nDame Victoria told the court that police bodycam footage of the protest showed officers struggling to remove the demonstrators from the road.\\nThe court heard the activists moved towards oncoming traffic before some successfully glued themselves on the road after being told to clear.\\nThe judge said: 'The footage shows a somewhat chaotic scene with the defendants very close to traffic, and in some instances moving traffic, and the police attempting to restrain them from continuing with their protest and re-entering the road.'\\nDame Victoria Sharp told the activists that it is 'integral' that orders made by the court 'must be obeyed'. She said: 'In our democratic society, all citizens are equal under the law and all are subject to the law.\\n'It is integral to the rule of law, and to the fair and peaceful resolution of disputes, first, that orders made by the court must be obeyed, unless and until they are set aside or subject to successful challenge on appeal, and secondly that a mechanism exists to enforce orders made by court against those who breach them.\\n'In this jurisdiction, that mechanism is provided by the law of contempt.'\\nInsulate Britain activists were also told by the judge that ordinary members of the public 'have rights too'.\\nDame Victoria Sharp told them: 'In a democratic society which recognises the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, protests causing some degree of inconvenience are to be expected and, up to a point, tolerated.\\n'But the words 'up to a point' are important. Ordinary members of the public have rights too, including the right to use the highways.\\n'The public's toleration of peaceful protest depends on an understanding that, in a society subject to the rule of law, the balance between the protesters' right to protest and the right of members of the public to use the highways is to be determined not by the say-so of the protesters, but according to the law.'\\nThe judge also said the public has an 'interest in deterring disobedience to its orders and in upholding the rule of law'.\\nSmart, who announced her intention to go on hunger strike after being jailed, said in a statement: 'Our Government is betraying us, betraying our vulnerable people and betraying our children's future.\\n'I believe that my intentions are morally right, even if my actions are deemed legally wrong. This court may see me as being on the wrong side of the law, but in my heart I know I am on the right side of history. I will not be a bystander.'\\nAnd Buse said in a statement: 'Care for the earth and all life requires me to act. My faith requires me to act, believing in the sacredness of creation and the demand for justice, justice for the trampled and exploited.\\n'Whilst acknowledging the importance of the courts, I have continued to break the injunction multiple times for we have a duty to the earth, to life, to future generations, to care and protect, this is the most important function of government, society and law.\\n'As we enter into the difficult years shifting to low carbon, and feeling the effects of climate change, we all need to be engaged in peaceful transformation; attempts to punish and crack down on peaceful protest opens the door to violent protest, which I deeply wish to avoid.'\\nSpeers added: 'Never before has a civilisation had the burden and the privilege to see its own collapse coming.\\n'In this world, those trying to avert catastrophe are vilified and criminalised, and those profiting from death are protected and rewarded. We asked for a chance to live. That's all.\\n'We did so in the tradition of non-violent protest upon which this country was built. In response, the Government declared it would do 'everything we can to stop them'.'\\n'In an insane world, the sane will be seen as insane. And in a democracy steeped in lies and corruption, good people have a duty to disobey bad laws.\\n'We did our duty and I await the day when a judge in a court of law is brave enough to do theirs.'\\nAn Insulate Britain spokesman said today: 'This morning our Insulate Britain supporters have been sentenced.\\n'We are being failed and betrayed by our government. Our nine chose not to standby and be complicit in genocide.'\\nDuring yesterday's hearing, Taylor said if he was 'not put in prison' for breaching an injunction banning disruptive protests on the nation's roads, he will 'go and block the motorway at the earliest opportunity and will continue to do so until the Government makes a meaningful statement and acts on it'.\\nHe added that 'whatever sentence or sanction' he was given 'will be counter-productive and will only serve to fuel the campaign of Insulate Britain'.\\nTaylor said: 'If you send me away to prison, ten people will step forward in my place. If you send each of us away, 100 people will step forward and take our places. If you send 100 of us away, 1,000 people will step forward to take our place.\\n'If you somehow manage to stop all non-violent protests, then things will only turn violent.'\\nAnd Smart told the court she was there to 'ensure future survival'.\\nShe said: 'That's what it boils down to. I am proud of what I did and I stand by my actions.\\n'I'm asking when you consider my sentence that my actions are proportionate to the crisis we are facing, where 8,500 people die a year from cold and hunger in their own homes.\\n'I am doing everything I can to protect the most vulnerable people in society. We are all vulnerable in a climate crisis. No-one is immune and no-one is safe. When I see injustice I cannot stand by and watch harm to life.'\\nSmart compared watching the climate crisis to watching a child trapped in a burning house. She said: 'I cannot stand by and watch. I would run to them.'\\nShe told the court: 'Our Government is betraying us, our vulnerable people and our children's future.\\n'I will not be a bystander while our Government fails and betrays its people, I will continue to do what is necessary.'\\nSpeers described the country's democracy as 'steeped in lies' and said 'good people have a duty to breach bad laws'.\\nHMP PENTONVILLE\\nLouis McKechnie, 20, Ben Buse, 36, Roman Paluch-Machnik, 28, Oliver Rock, 41, Tim Speers, 36, James Thomas, 47, and Ben Taylor, 37, have all be taken to HMP Pentonville after being jailed at the High Court today.\\nThe Category B jail - known as 'The Ville' - in Islington, North London, houses about 1,300 men who live in a mixture of single and shared rooms across seven wings.\\nWhen a prisoner first arrives they are allowed to contact one relative by phone and see a medical professional about any immediate health and wellbeing needs.\\nThey then have a four-day induction period to explain the prison rules, and education opportunities. A service provided by Novus lets them study for qualifications in subjects such as carpentry, food safety and painting.\\nThe jail also has four gym areas and a multi-faith chaplaincy service and works with the Catch 22 organisation which helps prisoners involved in gangs.\\nNotable former inmates over the last 40 years include footballers George Best and Nile Ranger; singers George Michael and Pete Doherty; and actor Keith Allen.\\nHMP BRONZEFIELD\\nAna Heyatawin, 58, and Emma Smart, 44, have both been sent to HMP Bronzefield after being jailed today.\\nThe jail in Ashford, Surrey, was Britain's first purpose-built prison for women when it opened in June 2004, as well as being the 10th privately-run prison in England.\\nUp to 572 women inmates can be held at the Category A jail across four houseblocks which can hold about 130 women in each one. Each wing has a servery unit for women to collect their food, which they can either eat together on the wing or take back to their rooms. Telephones are also provided in each room. It has a 17-bed healthcare facility, and a mother and baby unit for 12 women and 13 babies up to the age of 18 months.\\nWhen a woman arrives at the prison they will be searched and their welfare assessed by a doctor and nurse. They will also receive a meal and drink, before beginning an induction process the following day.\\nNotable former inmates at\u00a0Bronzefield include murderers Rose West and Joanna Dennehy, child abuser Vanessa George and the Labour MP Fiona Onasanya.\\nHe said: 'In this world, those trying to avert catastrophe are vilified. On a tradition of non-violent protest, in response, the Government said they will 'do everything to we can to stop them.'\\n'That was from Grant Shapps, who had a second job under another name.'\\nPaluch-Machnik told the court the injunction 'is not just in context with the crisis we're in'.\\nHe said: 'The Government would rather imprison pensioners than insulate their homes.'\\nMr Paluch said retrofitting homes is the cheapest way to tackle the climate crisis and added: 'We are asking for a fully funded state-operated retrofitted service, like the NHS.\\n'Some of those who have spoken have said they're not afraid. I'm afraid you will take away my home and me away from my friends, family and partner.\\n'But I'm more afraid of inaction and the climate catastrophe that has already began to crash on some of us. I stand by the action that brought me before this court, and if that sends me to prison, then so be it.'\\nHe urged the court to look at 'more than the letter of the law' and 'make the commitment to insulate Britain'.\\nHeyatawin told the High Court she is 'traumatised' by the Government's attitude to climate change.\\nShe said she 'does not accept the morality of the injunction' and said 'it is meaningless in the context of climate collapse'.\\nMs Heyatawin added: 'I know how to behave. I think I'm a good person. I felt compelled to stop the world and get off. We are hurtling towards ecocide, genocide and our own suicide.'\\nRock invited the court to observe a minute's silence 'to imagine what the climate crisis means for the future'.\u00a0 He said: 'I'm proud of our actions and I stand by what we have done, we have not done this for personal gain.\\n'I take responsibility for my actions and I did that in an attempt to mitigate the suffering of people in this country who cannot afford to adequately heat their homes.'\\nThe only defendant to have a lawyer was Dr Ben Buse, a Bristol University researcher. Owen Greenhall told the court Dr Buse was active in his local church and a highly regarded member of the community.\\nMyriam Stacey QC, representing National Highways, told the court the message that the defendants are 'proud of their conduct' and 'will continue to defy the injunction order made' is 'loud and clear'.\\nShe added: 'No apology has been made in relation to the breach of the order.'\\nMs Stacey said the group had emailed National Highways in September saying the protests would continue 'unless the Government make a meaningful statement that they will start the process of decarbonising homes in Britain'.\\nMs Stacey said further committal proceedings will be issued against other Insulate Britain protesters by the end of the week, relating to protests on October 27.\\nShe also said evidence is being gathered to bring proceedings in relation to protests on October 29 and November 2. All nine defendants were sentenced by Dame Victoria Sharp and Mr Justice Chamberlain.\\n'Contempt of court' is an offence that normally happens when someone risks unfairly influencing a court case, which may stop somebody from getting a fair trial.\\nIt can include taking photos or shouting out in court, refusing to answer questions as a witness or publicly commenting on a court case such as on social media.\\nAnother form it takes is disobeying or ignoring a court order, which is what the Insulate Britain activists have done by breaking an injunction on their M25 protests.\\nThose who breach the injunctions were found in contempt of court and could have faced a maximum penalty of two years in prison or an unlimited fine. In the end, they were jailed for between three and six months.\\nThe High Court has so far issued five injunctions to prevent protesters from blocking roads - four to National Highways and one to Transport for London (TfL).\\nThe hearings did not taking place in a criminal court because none of the protesters have been charged with a criminal offence by police. This is despite at least 161 activists having been involved in the demonstrations over the two months, resulting in at least 860 arrests.\\nThe protesters were instead facing contempt of court proceedings for breaching a High Court injunction, which is a civil matter but can still result in a jail term.\\nAn emotional Mr Rock told LBC radio yesterday: 'I feel terrified - I'm c***ping myself this morning, and I feel like crying. I've got all these emotions coming out of me. It seems ridiculous that we're in this situation.\\n'What we're asking the Government to do is just an extremely practical no-brainer thing that they should be doing, and they're choosing instead to potentially lock us up, fine us, seize our assets.\\n'I'm expecting that we might get sentenced maybe today, probably tomorrow. We've been told that quite probably we'll get custodial sentences, so there's a high likelihood that by this evening I'll be in a prison cell somewhere.'\\nThe Government plans to introduce new measures to clamp down on protests, including allowing police to stop and search people where there is a reasonable suspicion they are carrying items intended to cause disturbance, such as glue.\\nAfter today's sentencing a\u00a0statement from the nine activists jailed was read by an Insulate Britain supporter outside the Royal Courts of Justice.\\nIt read: 'Over the last nine weeks, 174 ordinary people have held the Government to account, asking that they deliver on their most basic of duties, to protect the British people, the economy and all we hold dear in our society.\\n'Your Government has now chosen to act. It has chosen to imprison us for this demand.\\n'By imprisoning us, the Government shows its cowardice. They would rather lock up pensioners than insulate their homes.\\n'They would rather lock up teachers than create thousands of proper jobs.\\n'They would rather lock up young people than take practical steps to reduce emissions.\\n'They will lock us up and leave thousands to die of cold this winter. We knew we would face prison when we took this action, but we could not stand by while the Government betrays the general public.'\\nThe activists' statement continued: 'Following the widely recognised failure of our Government at Cop26, we are continuing to ask them to get on with the job - of cutting carbon emissions, of insulating cold and leaky houses, of protecting the people of this country from climate collapse - because the lives of our children and those of all future generations hang in the balance.\\n'To the Government we say, you can't imprison a flood, there are no unlimited fines against a famine, you can't bankrupt a fire.\\n\\nSeptember 13 - 78 Insulate Britain protesters arrested after blocking junctions 3, 6, 14, 20 and 31 of the M25\\nSeptember 15 - More than 50 protesters arrested after targeting junctions 1, 8, 9 and 23 of the M25\\nSeptember 17 - 48 protesters arrested after targeting junctions 3, 9 and 28 of the M25, as well as the M3\\nSeptember 20 - 29 protesters are arrested after blocking the M25 at junctions 4 and 18, as well as the A1\\nSeptember 21 - Protesters risk death by running into moving traffic to block the carriageway near Junction 10.

In the past, when governments have failed to protect their people the right thing to do is to highlight this injustice, breaking the law if needed, this is what the suffragettes and Martin Luther King did, and it is what Insulate Britain has done.\\n'We call on you to recognise that you also have a duty to act, as our Government is betraying us. They can't even act to insulate Britain.\\n'What hope do we have of them protecting our children, our economy or our country?'\\nThe statement concluded: 'We say to those who look on in fear and denial - this will impact you and all that you love, and look at what we did.\\n'A few hundred people captured the country's attention for months. Think what 1,000 people can achieve?\\n'You have a choice. To act, to come and join us help change the tide of history, or to be a bystander and be complicit in enabling genocide.\\n'This tide will not come again, will you join us?'\\nFollowing the sentencing, Greenpeace UK programme director Pat Venditti said: 'Jailing climate activists during a climate crisis is like silencing a smoke alarm while half the building is on fire.\\n'What this country needs are fewer injunctions and more insulation. Instead of cracking down on climate activism, the UK Government should crack down on cold homes.\\n'One will be an international embarrassment, the other a sign of real climate leadership.\\n'An ambitious home insulation programme funded by the Government would lower energy bills, cut planet-heating emissions and boost the UK's energy security - it's a triple win.\\n'Boris Johnson must show that he hasn't left his commitment behind at Glasgow Central station and he's ready to roll up sleeves and lead by example on tackling the climate crisis.'\\nLiberty director Gracie Bradley said: 'We should all be able to stand up for what we believe, but when the means to do so are continually narrowed - whether that be at the ballot box, in the courts or in the streets - people will take to more urgent routes.\\n'While Insulate Britain knew that by breaching the injunction they risked jail, these sentences clearly are disproportionate and another threat to protest rights for all of us.\\n'For years, injunctions have been used by the powerful to stifle dissent and restrict protest rights, while demonstrators have been demonised.\\n'The impact has been stifling free expression, undermining the ability of all of us to stand up for what we believe in - particularly people from marginalised communities who are most cut off from the corridors of power.\\n'Today's sentences must be seen in the context of the expansive and oppressive powers in the Policing Bill, itself a grab for more power by a Government that despises scrutiny and accountability.\\n'The right to protest protects all of us and is the cornerstone of a healthy democracy. We must not allow those in power to demonise demonstrators in a cynical attempt to silence us all.'\\nDuncan Smith, executive director of operations at National Highways, said: 'Safety is our top priority and we welcome this outcome.\\n'We respect people's right to protest but do not condone the actions of anyone who puts their lives, and the lives of road users, at risk.\\n'The judge's decision will hopefully make people think again about carrying out reckless and dangerous protests such as these and endangering people's lives.\\n'The injunctions remain in place and we stand ready to do what is necessary to limit the impact of any protests on the strategic road network, and to keep drivers safe and on the move.'", "image": [["Ben Taylor",

'It is frustrating\u00a0that after years of litigation through two presidential administrations, the Secret Service and Air Force are still stonewalling the costs of presidential travel,' Fitton said.\\nBiden has visited his home in Wilmington, Delaware, 22 times and his Rehoboth Beach house - 100miles from Wilmington - three times, where the president, First Lady Jill Biden and their German Shepherd Major are often pictured bike riding or walking along the beach.\\nThe White House has refused to release visitor log information for Biden's Delaware homes although he is said to have recently hosted Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New Jersey and Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia for legislative talks in Wilmington.\\nHe has also been to Camp David in Maryland for 11 weekend getaways.\\nBut Greg Jenkins, director of White House advance planning under President George W Bush, doesn't think Biden's time away from Washington is such a bad thing.\\n'For my money, the more a president gets some time to himself or herself, the better.

The case of David Fuller, who not only took the lives of two young women \u2013 Wendy Knell, 25, and Caroline Pierce, 20 \u2013but also admitted 44 charges of necrophilia, involving women and girls aged between nine and 100 in morgues across Sussex and Kent, is beyond the comprehension of most people.\\nAnd when I read the account of Nevres Kemal, the mother of one of Fuller\u2019s victims, Azra Kemal, I felt an overwhelming sense of rage on her behalf, and on behalf of the families of all his other victims, which police fear may run into the hundreds.\\nAfter officers visited her home to tell her that the lifeless body of her beautiful, vibrant daughter had been violated not just once, but three times, by this monster \u2013 and that he had filmed himself doing so \u2013 she grabbed the nearest knife and ran to her local police station with the intention of putting \u2018that knife straight through his heart because he\u2019d put a knife through mine\u2019.\\nHad that been my daughter, my beloved child, I would have done exactly the same. I would have been deranged with grief, blinded by fury, intent on avenging her with no regard for the consequences. It would have felt like the only sane response to such an insane act of depravity.\\nAnd I\u2019m afraid that when I read that this poor woman, clearly delirious with emotions no one should have to suffer, was handcuffed and thrown to the floor by eight or nine officers and then confined to a cell for 34 hours, all I could think of was: \u2018I wish she\u2019d got him.\u2019\\nEspecially when you realise that the maximum penalty for raping a corpse in this country is just two years.

Time and again Fuller filmed himself carrying out these revolting acts, and kept careful records. He has not only taken life, he has defiled the sanctity of death.\\nWhatever may have driven this man to commit these crimes, the agony and suffering that he has inflicted is incalculable.\\nThere has to be a price to pay, not just for the sake of the victims and their relatives, but for the sake of humanity itself. But there is no punishment on this earth that can meet that challenge.\\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s simple: men like Fuller who do the unthinkable force us, as a society, to think the unthinkable.\\nIt\u2019s not pretty.

Most of the protestors were intercepted before reaching the carriageway.\\n'Several protestors were also at the A1081 St Albans Road slip road, and had glued themselves to the carriageway and the pavement. Partial road closures were put in place in order to allow specially trained officers to safely de-bond them and make arrests.

Four people were also arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage.\\nChief Superintendent Nick Caveney said: 'Officers were at the scene within minutes, working quickly to make arrests and putting partial road closures in place in order to keep traffic flowing, meaning that disruption was kept to a minimum. Some 20 people were arrested in connection with the protest activity in Hertfordshire today, and will be taken to custody.\\n'Not only is purposely blocking a highway incredibly dangerous, it also affects countless members of the public who are inconvenienced as a result. We would like to thank motorists for their patience while officers dealt with the matter this morning.\\n'We understand how frustrating incidents of this nature are to the public, and want to reassure you that we have robust plans in place in order to minimise any disruption and to allow us to make arrests as quickly as we possibly can.\\n'We continue to work closely with our partners and other affected forces to ensure that any further activity is dealt with effectively and efficiently.'\\nA retired Anglican vicar was once again back at the Insulate Britain protests today - marking the 11th time she has been arrested in just over seven weeks.\\nReverend Sue Parfitt, 79, from Bristol, who is also involved with Extinction Rebellion, was taken away from the M25 near South Mimms in Hertfordshire today.\\nIt was the fourth time she has been arrested in the past nine days - having also been detained on the M25 near\u00a0 Brentwood last Friday, Dartford in Kent last Wednesday, and\u00a0on\u00a0Bishopsgate in London last Monday.\\nShe has also already been arrested at other protests on the M25 on September 13, 21 and 29, and October 13.\\nParfitt was fined more than \u00a31,500 in July after she took part in two XR road blockades in Parliament Square and outside a Ministry of Defence site near Bristol.\\nIt comes after 18-year-old Miss Thunberg was asked on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday whether 'blocking roads' was justified, and replied: 'To make clear, as long as no one gets hurt... then I think sometimes you need to anger some people.\\n'Like, for instance, the school strike movement would never have become so big if there wasn't friction, if some people didn't get p***** off.'\\nShe said she speaks to activists in countries like China where they do not have the same rights, and added: 'It makes you just feel so grateful that we are actually able to protest and that just puts more responsibility on us who actually have the right to protest, to use that right.'\\nThis morning in Herfordshire, around 20 demonstrators arrived at the M25 but were stopped by police from getting into the road at about 8am.\\nSix sat on the pavement with a banner, and some glued themselves to the ground. Another two managed to glue themselves to one lane of the carriageway on a quiet part of the roundabout.\\nA group of officers have been lifting activists from the pavement and putting them in the back of a van.\\nReverend Sue Parfitt, 79, a retired family therapist from Bristol, was among those detained. More than a dozen officers and seven police vehicles were at the scene.\\nSome passers-by shouted expletives at the protesters while other beeped their horns.\\nJess, 25, who had glued her hand to the road, said: 'Before we started doing this no-one was talking about insulation, nobody cared about it, nobody knew it was an issue now, and it's been in the newspapers and it's been all over people's dinner table conversations for the last six weeks.\\n'They say 'we agree with your cause but not the tactics', but at the end of the day they only know about our cause because of our tactics.'\\nNine demonstrators have received committal papers in relation to an injunction granted to National Highways to curb activist roadblocks, Insulate Britain confirmed.\\nThose who break the injunctions could be found in contempt of court and face a maximum penalty of two years in prison or an unlimited fine.\\nDiana Warner, 62, a retired GP, said: 'One of the important reasons for coming out today was to say we're all together. It's not just nine.'\\nIn a press release issued today, Insulate Britain quoted two protesters explaining why the demonstrations were now going nationwide.\\nOne of them was Gabby, 27, a graphic designer from Norwich, who said: 'We are taking our message to people outside of London because we want everyone to know that our government is killing our children.\\n'Britain should be leading the world with radical plans to decarbonise our society, instead our government is actively setting policies that will drive emissions higher.\\n'The public can close their eyes but this isn't going away, no one is coming to save you. We are being betrayed. This government is colluding in genocide.'\\nThe group said nine of its supporters have received summons for breaking the injunction and are due to attend court on November 16, with a further 23 people expected to follow. It said they face unlimited fines and prison sentences for contempt of court.\\nThe group also quoted Biff, 54, a retail worker from Canterbury, who said: 'I am honoured and privileged to stand in solidarity with my brave friends who have been the first to receive their committal dates; facing unlimited fines and prison sentences for conducting proportionate nonviolent civil resistance to stop our government destroying this country with their cowardice and greed.\\n'I too have broken the High Court Injunctions several times and I will continue to do so until this treasonous government, supported by heartless and scared journalists, starts to take credible action to safeguard its citizens' lives.'\\nLast Friday, Insulate\u00a0Britain caused yet more traffic chaos and diced with death by walking onto the M25 in morning rush hour. They later boasted about causing 'major disruption in several locations' on the motorway.\\nA group of 14 walked up and down the painted white lines between lanes in live traffic, causing tailbacks. At one point, three sat and laid down in the middle of the carriageway, bringing traffic grinding to a halt.\\nIn a press release the group said activists had gone 'walking on the motorway' and were 'demanding that the Government gets on with the job of insulating Britain's homes'.\u00a0Ten arrests were made after the stunt, between junctions 28 and 29 near Brentwood in Essex.\\nThe group acknowledged it is knowingly breaching a High Court injunction that aims to prevent its disruptive activities.\u00a0The activists were effectively banned from all major roads in England last week after a court ruling approved an injunction against protests on 4,300 miles of motorways and A-roads, also known as the Strategic Road Network.\\nThis was extended until November 11 at another hearing on Thursday. Breaking the injunction can lead to unlimited fines or even jail for contempt of court.\\nThe High Court was told on Thursday how just three days of protests had cost taxpayers almost \u00a3900,000.\\nThe group, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, has demanded that Prime Minister Boris Johnson fast-tracks plans to insulate Britain's homes to cut carbon emissions.\\nWorld leaders are playing a deadly game with the planet, protesters have said, urging world leaders gathered at Cop26 to do more to stop climate change.\\nProtesters dressed as Joe Biden, Xi Jinping, Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron, along with eight other world leaders, and played a series of four children's games in a Squid Game-themed demonstration today in Glasgow.\\nAndrew Nazdin, the director of the Glasgow Actions Team, who organised the event, demanded that more be done to stop climate change, and added that the 'time for climate games is over'.\\n'World leaders need to agree a plan to keep warming well below 1.5 degrees Celsius and put up money to fund a just transition across the global south,' he said.\\nThe hit Netflix programme follows a heavily indebted gambler who is competing against hundreds of others in a series of children's games in an attempt to win a huge payout.\\nMalcolm White of the Glasgow Actions Team, dressed as Prime Minister Boris Johnson, was taking part in the games opposite the Scottish Event Campus (SEC), where global leaders are trying to thrash out a new climate deal.\\n'We're here playing the Squid Game in order to highlight that the climate leaders are playing games with the planet,' said the 34-year-old. 'They're here, they're using lots of rhetoric, but they're not actually, so far, engaging with the discussion process at the level which we think is in keeping with the climate crisis we are all facing.'\\nThe 'leaders' played climate hopscotch, tug-of-war, kicked around an inflatable world, and rolled dice. At one point Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden could be seen tussling with the inflatable Earth as boilersuit-clad protesters watched on in front of a sign that urged them to 'stop playing climate games'.\\n\\nIt wants this done by the end of the decade, with a 'legally binding' national plan published within four months. They claim it would avoid 8,500 deaths due to fuel poverty and help struggling families pay their energy bills.\\nInsulate Britain also hit out at criticism of the group by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, with a spokesman saying: 'Insulating Britain's leaky homes is an essential part of acting on the climate emergency.\\n'In fact the UK Climate Change Committee has said that there is no route to Net Zero that does not involve the near complete elimination of carbon emissions from our housing stock which is some of the most energy inefficient in Europe.\\n'Insulate Britain has a well thought out plan for a government funded nationwide retrofit programme. Kwasi Kwarteng is rejecting a plan that would cut 15 per cent from our carbon emissions, avoid 8,500 fuel poverty deaths a year, and stop millions of British families being cold and hungry every year, while dealing with the cost of living crisis.\\n'Mr Kwarteng, is it 'ludicrous' to demand an end to deaths from fuel poverty in the sixth richest country in the world? Is giving government grants for home insulation an 'excessive state intervention'? Is protecting our children from future misery, starvation and death an 'eye watering intrusion'? If so, we are guilty as charged.\\n'Mr Kwarteng, you have a responsibility to serve the interests of all the people of this country, not just the few who are profiting from your careless disregard for the fate of our children and future generations. We will not forgive your betrayal and cowardice.'\\nCabinet minister George Eustice has condemned the eco mob's actions as 'highly irresponsible' and 'a safety risk on our roads'.\\nHe also said Home Secretary Priti Patel was looking at beefing-up the law to give police more powers to tackle the protesters.\\nLast week the Daily Mail revealed that eco warriors are plotting to exploit gaps in Scottish law to wreak havoc at the Cop26 summit.\\nAround 400 climate activists sized up potential loopholes during a meeting promoted by Extinction Rebellion (XR) last week.\\nConspirators noted a recent High Court injunction banning road blockades does not apply in Scotland \u2013 and that officers will be 'overwhelmed' by the scale of the protests.\\nIt was also hinted protesters with charges against their name in England may get a blank canvas across the border as forces 'don't always communicate to each other'.\\nIt comes amid growing alarm among rank-and-file officers about the potential for chaos as police brace for the 'most complex and complicated policing operation ever seen in Britain'.\\nHundreds of thousands of protesters from around the world are expected to descend on the two-week summit.\\nXR's Scottish spokesman Myke Hall has said ministers should be 'very worried' about their plans to disrupt the event.\\nTop brass in Scotland have warned Cop26 could prove a magnet for anarchists and believe some extremists could use children as human shields during violent standoffs, a tactic seen during the storming of the Capitol in the US in January.\\nAt the start of the two-hour protest meeting last Tuesday, attendees were asked 'not to say anything specific about actions that you have been involved with, or are planning', due to fears of infiltration within the group.\\nBut during an extensive Q&A session, rebels probed potential weaknesses in the police and criminal justice system that hinted at plots to blockade roads and outwit officers.\\nKnow Your Rights Training was provided by the Scottish Community and Activist Legal Project, which is providing legal support to XR during Cop26.\\nRepresentatives fielded a series of searching questions including whether an injunction against road blockades aimed at curbing Insulate Britain protests in England applied in Scotland and if protest-related charges in England would be passed on to Police Scotland.\\nA spokesman said the injunction did not apply in Scotland, while it was also suggested police will only make arrests 'if they need to' for fear of being 'overwhelmed'.\\nJohn Scott QC, an adviser to Police Scotland on Cop26, told the Mail 'there is a very different tone and style' to policing in Scotland, 'with an emphasis on encouraging peaceful protest'.\\nBut there are fears protesters who break the law could go free as a shortage of cells could force police to let some off with warnings.\\nOne demonstration on November 6 is expected to attract more than 150,000 protesters and smaller groups such as Insulate Britain are expected to take part in acts of disorder, which could result in a significant number of arrests.\\n** Do you know who the West Midlands Police officer in Birmingham is?

They were backed up by coastguard personnel.\\nThe target was the 'Loch Ness Debt Monster', a 13ft high and 26ft long inflatable which had been commissioned by campaigners pressing COP26 to ease debt for poorer nations.\\nThe giant toy had being situated beside the River Clyde - with permission - on private land owned by The Govan Wetlands Project since yesterday.\\nIt was about half a mile from the venue for the summit, and campaigners had no plans to take it up the river. But police swooped at breakfast time and 'arrested' the toy.\\nSenior police officers told activists from the Jubilee Debt Campaign 'Nessie' was being seized under section 20 of the police and fire reform act.\\nJDC executive director Ms Heidi Chow said: 'I think that was completely overreaction, and over policing for a non violent harmless stunt to raise the issue of debt to address the climate crisis.\\n'This is a sad reflection of the way that debt is being sidelined in the main COP26 negotiations.

Once again these people are blocking democracy and the fact that people are actually talking about the same issues and being blocked from doing so is totally counterproductive.'\\nMr Anthony-Gord said he had been waiting in his bus at the head of the queuing traffic on Parliament Square for 34 minutes, and would usually be driving a route towards Crystal Palace over Lambeth Bridge.\\nRachel Speller, a bus driver's wife, had walked to the front of the traffic to see what had happened after sitting on a bus with her husband, the driver, in the tailback along Whitehall.\\nShe said: 'It is just getting ridiculous now. Every other week there is some sort of protest and now they glue themselves to the floor.'\\nAn Insulate Britain spokesman said today: 'Insulate Britain has been one of the most successful campaigns in history: our name recognition went from zero to 77 per cent of the public in three weeks.\\n'We have attracted enormous media interest and we have started thousands of conversations, in the press, on social media and in homes up and down the country.\\n'Importantly, we have exposed the government's refusal to act on home insulation as cowardly and vindictive and their refusal to protect our country and our children from the climate crisis as genocidal and treasonous.'\\nThey added: 'What we say to the bystanders who look on in fear and denial is this: look at what we did. A hundred people captured the country's attention for weeks. Think what 1,000 people can achieve.\\n'Come and join us and we will change the tide of history. What more meaningful thing can you do with your lives, at this time when everyone and everything you love is in mortal danger?'\\nOn Tuesday, police failed to arrest Insulate Britain activists blocking a busy road near a hospital, instead telling them that they did not 'want to put good people in a cell'.\\nWest Midlands Police asked the group of protesters to leave the A400 on Tuesdaymorning, giving them 'another ten minutes' on the road near Birmingham Children's Hospital before the group 'dispersed peacefully'.\\nIn a video, a constable could be seen asking them to move as nearby 'you've got the children's hospital, you've got people that are dying, kids that are dying, people going for cancer therapies'.\\nBut despite the force's softly-softly approach, Insulate Britain returned a few hours later to the streets of central Birmingham, causing disruption as they clogged up the junction once more.\\nThe activists were once again 'spoken to' by officers, before agreeing to leave, the force said. Tuesday's demonstrations in Birmingham and Manchester were the first time the group has operated north of London.\\nGreater Manchester Police were forced to spend hours dislodging activists who had glued themselves to the road near Manchester Airport, eventually arresting 11 people.\\nThe group also targeted their normal stamping ground of the M25, with Hertfordshire Police arresting 20 people trying to block Junction 23, and the A1081 St Albans Road slip road.\\nOver the weekend Swedish activist Greta Thunberg voiced support for the group's tactics, saying sometimes you have to 'p*** people off' to protect the environment.\\nIt comes as world leaders and members of the Royal Family continue to gather in Glasgow for the landmark Cop26 climate change conference.", "image": [["A

She also took part in a Government coronavirus press conference in May last year.\\nBut amid the Covid pandemic, Baroness Casey launched blistering attacks on the Government, criticising the coronavirus cash scheme.\\nEarlier this year, she warned the Tories risk being seen as 'the nasty party' if the Chancellor axes a \u00a320 increase in Universal Credit - which has been withdrawn this month.\\nBaroness Casey said if the increase was withdrawn at the end of March, it would be 'too punitive' for families struggling during the pandemic.\\n'The Treasury need to step back and not feel this constant responsibility to close the books all the time and fight and fight and fight,' she said, mimicking\u00a0Theresa May's jibe in 2002.\\n'They need to step back and think if we really want to rebuild Britain, what type of economic policy do we need to put in place that will ... not take the knees out from under people.\\n'To remove that \u00a320 a week - it's too punitive, it's not the right thing to do, and I think they just go back to being the nasty party.'\\nAnd in December 2020, she criticised the Government, saying people could be forced to 'prostitute themselves' to 'put food on the table' as the Covid support is inadequate.\\nIn the attack, she warned measures to support employees not working during lockdowns would not 'cut it'.\\nThe ex-civil servant, who advised Labour and Tory governments but stepped down when she was awarded a peerage, voiced fears the UK was headed for a period of 'destitution'.\\nTory MP Sir Desmond Swayne said Baroness Casey had gone 'over the top' and 'undermined her argument'.\\nBaroness\u00a0Casey told BBC News: 'Do we want to go back to the days where people can't put shoes on the children's feet? Are we actually asking people in places like Liverpool to go out and prostitute themselves, so that they could put food on the table?'\\nShe said it was wrong for Downing Street to have a sense that 'people will make do' because they 'weren't coping before Covid'.\\nBut an HM Treasury spokesman said: 'This is misleading. As the Chancellor made clear in the House of Commons, and leading think tanks have pointed out, the Job Support Scheme is generous by international standards.'\\nCommander Rachel Williams said: 'We've heard loud and clear the dismay and disappointment in us as a police service, of how people, and women in particular, have questioned whether they can trust us to keep them safe.\\n'We depend on the trust of the public. It is fundamental to our core purpose of keeping the public safe.\\n'We cannot and are not waiting for the findings of ongoing inquiries to begin rebuilding trust.'\\nCouzens kidnapped Ms Everard using his Met Police handcuffs in Clapham Common in March before raping her, killing her and hiding her body in Kent.\\nHe pleaded guilty to murder in June and was sentenced to a whole life order in September.\\nThe Home Secretary said this week a independent probe into her death will be given greater powers if the newly-appointed chairwoman feels unable to fulfil her remit.\\nPriti Patel announced Dame Elish Angiolini QC, a former lord advocate of Scotland, has agreed to take up the position to chair the two-part inquiry.\\nThe first part of the inquiry will establish a comprehensive account of Couzens' conduct throughout his career in policing, including looking for whether any red flags were missed and whether allegations made against him were properly handled.\\nIt will draw on ongoing investigations by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS).\\nThe second part of the inquiry will look at specific issues raised by part one, which will report to the Home Secretary as soon as possible.\\nMs Patel, who branded Couzens a 'monster', said the inquiry will proceed on a non-statutory basis in a bid to give Ms Everard's family 'closure as quickly as possible'.\\nShe added to MPs: 'Statutory inquiries can be long-running with limited flexibility, sometimes recommendations are not made for a number of years.\\n'However, I will not rule out converting this onto a statutory footing should Dame Elish feel that she's unable to fulfil the terms of reference on a non-statutory basis.\\n'Sarah Everard's life was ended too early by an evil man whose job it was to protect her.\\n'We owe it to her and her loved ones and her family to prevent something like this from ever happening again.'\\nEarlier confirming the appointment, Ms Patel said: 'Dame Elish is an exceptionally distinguished lawyer, academic and public servant.\\n'Her extensive experience includes a review of deaths in police custody, as well as a review for the Scottish Government on the handling of complaints and alleged misconduct against police officers.'\\nShadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds welcomed the appointment, but added: 'Put it on a statutory footing now.\\n'The Daniel Morgan Inquiry was on a non-statutory basis and still took eight years so time is not the argument not to do it.'\\nDame Elish said in a statement: 'I am deeply honoured to have been asked to chair this vital inquiry, which comes at a pivotal moment for policing.\\n'The murder of Sarah Everard was profoundly shocking and I will ensure that the issues raised from this dreadful tragedy are fully investigated and the necessary lessons learned.'\\nLast month Met Police PC David Henigan, of the Road Transport Policing Command, was found guilty of gross misconduct.\\nHe was found to have sexually assaulted two teenage girls at a nightclub in south west London in 2019.\\nMeanwhile earlier this month officers\u00a0PC Deniz Jaffer and PC Jamie Lewis admitted sharing 'sickening' photos of two bodies with 42 colleagues on WhatsApp.\\nThey were supposed to protect the scene after sisters Bibaa Henry, 46, and Nicole Smallman, 27, were found stabbed to death in Wembley, London.\\nBut they breached the cordon to take 'inappropriate' photographs of the bodies, which were sent 'to a dentist and doctor', and a WhatsApp group.\\nJaffer took four photographs and Lewis took two - one of which was sent to a female colleague with Lewis's face superimposed onto it.\\nPolice watchdog the IOPC later revealed Lewis also used 'degrading and sexist language' to describe the victims in the WhatsApp team group of 42 colleagues.\\nThe Met revealed a new 44-question handcuff policy this week but it was branded 'embarrassing' and blasted for treating trained police officers like children'.\\nThe policy on handcuffing tells officers to ask themselves 44 questions before arresting a suspect and details the procedure in a child-style ABC guide.\\nIts mammoth decision process is laid out in full in the new 25-page document published by Scotland Yard.\\nIt puts into official policy nearly 50 questions officers should consider when they are using the police-issue restraints.\\nThe questions include, 'What could go wrong (and what could go well)?', 'What is happening?', and, 'What do I not know?'.\\nOther advice to mull over also includes, 'Do I need to take action immediately?' and 'What would the victim or community affected expect of me in this situation?'\\nMost are from the College of Policing's National Decision Model but are now enshrined in the official equipment policy.\\nIt is not clear what the Met's previous policy on the police restraint tactic had been.\\nShooting dead of Tube passenger in 2005\\nCressida Dick was Gold Commander in charge of the operation which resulted in an innocent man being shot dead on July 22, 2005.\\nSurveillance officers searching for those responsible for the failed terror attacks the day before shot Brazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes after he entered Stockwell underground station.\\nTwo years later the Met was found guilty of a series of errors around the tragedy, although Dame Cressida was exonerated.\\nShe continued to support her officers saying they had acted in accordance with information they had at the time. Sources have described the control room where the ill-fated operation was run as 'utterly chaotic'.\\n'Culture of cover up' over fantastist Nick\\nOperation Midland resulted in the targeting of high-profile individuals after a fantasist falsely claimed he was the childhood victim of a paedophile ring.\\nTaking the preposterous claims of Carl Beech \u2013 aka 'Nick' \u2013 at face value, Met officers searched the homes of former Tory MP Harvey Proctor, Lord Bramall the former chief of defence staff, and Lady Brittan, widow of the former Tory home secretary Leon Brittan.\\nOperation Midland collapsed in March 2016. No charges or arrests were made. Beech was later convicted of fraud and perverting the course of justice and sentenced to 18 years in prison.\\nAn inquiry by retired high court judge, Sir Richard Henriques, found more than 40 failings in the police operation.\\nA subsequent damning report revealed that the Met had delayed implementing most of the reforms and Dame Cressida, who had been briefly involved in the original operation as assistant commissioner, faced pressure to resign.\\nSir Richard later called for a criminal investigation into five detectives and said confidence in the criminal justice system had been damaged.\\nAmid allegations of a Met cover-up, Home Secretary Priti Patel is under mounting pressure to instigate a series of new independent inquiries into Midland.\\nDame Cressida is not out of the woods on this one.

This is why we have disarmed your car by deflating one or more of its tyres.'\\nThe campaigners, who are among thousands of protesters who have travelled to Glasgow over the past fortnight to take part in demonstrations, added on the flyer: 'Action is required from you: Go small. Go public transport.'\\nIt is not clear what offence any of the activists - if identified - could be arrested or charged with under Scottish law, although one possibility is vandalism under the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995.\\nThis legislation states under section 52 that 'any person who, without reasonable excuse, wilfully or recklessly destroys or damages any property belonging to another shall be guilty of the offence of vandalism'.\\nThose convicted of this offence in a district court can be imprisoned for a maximum of 60 days or given a fine of up to \u00a31,000. In a sheriff court they could be sent to prison for up to three months or given a fine of \u00a310,000.\\nThe average house price in Glasgow West End - the area targeted - over the last year was \u00a3270,561 according to RightMove, which was \u00a370,753 or 35 per cent more than the average price across the whole city of \u00a3199,808.\\nTyred of SUVs have 'strongly denied' damaging any tyres - which have to be pumped back up - and insisted that 'deflation via the valve is by far the quickest and easiest way to deflate a tyre, and leaves the tyre intact'.\\nRAC road safety spokesman Simon Williams told MailOnline: 'Providing a vehicle hasn't been driven on flat tyres and there's no damage caused to the tyres or valves, they should just be able to be pumped up without issue.\\n'If, however, a car is driven with one or more flat tyres it can cause damage. There's also a far greater risk of a vehicle being involved in an accident due to the negative effect on steering and braking.'\\nJack Cousens, the AA's head of roads policy, added: 'Letting down tyres is for the most part just a big irritation but there will be occasions when delaying health professionals and other people with essential jobs is irresponsible.\\n'It has to be remembered that Scotland's bad weather and more rural landscape outside the cities often makes a larger 4x4-type vehicle essential.'\\nTyred of SUVs is made up of breakaway activists from Glasgow Calls Out Polluters (GCOP), a group of fossil fuel divestment campaigners who formed after the city was announced in August 2019 as the COP26 host location.\\nGCOP is not thought to be directly linked to Insulate Britain, a group of eco zealots who have blocked roads on 19 days since September 13, causing misery for drivers stuck around London, Manchester, Birmingham and Dover.\\nAt least 161 people have been involved in the roadblock protests over the past two months and there have been at least 860 arrests. Up to 32 of the group's activists face up to two years in jail for breaching a High Court injunction.\\nIt comes as COP26 ends today with the fate of a landmark global agreement on climate change hanging in the balance with major coal producing countries such as India and Russia demanding that it be watered down.\\nThe summit is expected to have a carbon footprint twice as large as the last conference on climate change, making it the most carbon-intensive summit of its kind, according to a preliminary report for the UK Government by consultants Arup which states 102,500 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) is due to be released by the event.\\nAnd there has been criticism of long flights taken by world leaders and business magnates including Amazon's Jeff Bezos whose \u00a348million Gulf Stream led a 400-strong parade of private jets into COP26 a fortnight ago, including those belonging to Prince Albert of Monaco, scores of royals and dozens of 'green' chief executives.\\nClimate activists at 'Tyred of SUVs' say they deflated the tyres, and did not damage them. They insisted that 'deflation via the valve is by far the quickest and easiest way to deflate a tyre, and leaves the tyre intact'.\\nBut a flat tyre needs to be pumped up before driving away because this could otherwise damage the wheels.\\nHalford recommends removing the cap and inserting an LED tyre pressure gauge into the valve, which displays pressure in PSI (pound force per square inch). You can then compare the measured PSI to the recommended PSI of your tyres. This can be established by checking the numbers on the sidewall of the tyre, to give its size.\\nThis can then be compared against the recommended pressures, which will be in the owner's manual and often on the inside of the driver's door sill or the fuel cap.\\nYou can then top up the pressure using a tyre inflator, by removing the value caps and press the hose fitting down on the valve. Then press the lever, or, if the hose has a screw fitting, screw until tight. Once the inflator is turned on, you should feel air flowing through the hose.\\nThe gauge will show when the correct pressure has been reached. You should then recheck the pressures with the digital gauge, and put the valve caps back on.\\nGCOP have been involved in various protests over the past fortnight and joined with Extinction Rebellion on Monday to block a busy road by chaining themselves to bicycles in the city, leading to 16 arrests.\\nAmong the motorists affected by the protests was pharmacist Jamie MacConnacher, who discovered the two front tyres of his Land Rover had been deflated yesterday morning \u2013 along with several other cars in the local area.\\nHe told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme: 'I don't think targeting individuals that have these vehicles is the right way to do it. They don't know what the reason for somebody having that car is.\\n'I understand that there is a need for change, I'm totally for that. I would have an electric car but it's the logistics in the West End of Glasgow. There's nowhere to charge outside your flat so it just doesn't work for me.'\\nSolicitor and mother Lucy Conn, 31, who lives in Glasgow's West End, said she found her tyres had been deflated after leaving her house at about 12.30pm yesterday to go on the nursery run.\\nBut she said her car was unfairly targeted because it is a two-wheel car with a 1.6 litre engine \u2013 and not an SUV.\\nMs Conn added that the tyres of her neighbour's car, which has a 1.2 litre engine, had also been deflated.\\nShe told The Scotsman: 'I thought it was a bit mean given there were two car seats in the back of the car \u2013 it's obviously not a car for one person. It is always normal folk that get the brunt of it.'\\nTyred of SUVs later apologised for this specific incident, telling the newspaper: 'Our intention was to target SUVs only. If Ms Conn's car was targeted by our group, we apologise.\\n'The mistake may have been due to the fact that more and more non-SUVs are being designed to look like SUVs \u2014 apparently, climate destruction is fashionable.'\\nOther motorists hit by the action took to social media to air their frustration, including Victoria Young who tweeted: 'To the idiots who did this to my car as I'm trying to get to Paisley High Court this morning.\\n'Did it ever occur to you that the driver might have to use their vehicle in an emergency? It's being reported to Police Scotland.'\\nOne member of Tyred of SUVs, known only as Fin, told the BBC: 'We feel we need to do this because we need to point to the people who are responsible - rich people in the global north.\\n'This is a minor inconvenience that is not going to disrupt them in a huge way. What is really going to disrupt people's lives and kill them is the climate crisis caused by rich people - basically SUV owners.'\\nTyred of SUVs said that no tyres were damaged in the action. A spokesman for the group said: 'If 4\u00d74 drivers were a nation, they'd be the 7th biggest polluters on the planet (Source: International Energy Agency).\\n'If the 1 per cent won't take responsibility for the climate destruction they wreak, we'll make them.'\\nA Police Scotland spokesman told MailOnline: 'We are aware of these incidents and there will be increased patrols in the area to provide reassurance to local residents.'\\nBy KATIE WESTON FOR MAILONLINE\\nCop26 is expected to have a carbon footprint twice as large as the last conference on climate change, making it the most carbon-intensive summit of its kind.\\nA preliminary report for the UK Government by consultants Arup states 102,500 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) is due to be released by the summit in Glasgow.\\nThis comes in comparison to\u00a051,101 tCO2e from Cop25 in Madrid in 2019.\\nAround 60 per cent is produced by international flights taken by world leaders and business magnates including Amazon's Jeff Bezos, said The Scotsman newspaper.\\nHis \u00a348million Gulf Stream led a 400-strong parade of private jets into Cop26 a fortnight ago, including those belonging to Prince Albert of Monaco, scores of royals and dozens of 'green' CEOs.\\nThe findings come as Cop26 nears the end of its second full week in Glasgow, with more than 30,000 people expected to attend the conference.\\nThe UK Government said this year's summit is the largest climate change conference so far, and the Arup report includes emissions from both the blue and green zones.\\nThe Arup report said its figure of 102,500 tCO2e represented 'the best working assessment of the emissions from the event'.\\nCommenting on the report, Greenpeace UK's Dr Doug Parr said: 'The meeting in Glasgow is not supposed to be a demonstration of sustainable lifestyles, and it shouldn't be judged in those terms.\\n'But the failure to reach any meaningful agreement about limiting aviation's vast carbon emissions - at a conference where 60% of their emissions came from aviation, with a backing chorus of media outrage at the private jet hypocrisy of the elites - really highlights the lack of equity in these talks.\\n'Creating loopholes for the use of the rich not only maintains their disproportionately high emissions, but makes it so much harder to persuade anyone else to cut.'\\nThe total greenhouse gas emissions for Cop25, which was held in Madrid in 2019, stood at 51,101 tCO2e, while at Cop21 in Paris in 2015 the figure was 43,000 tCO2e.\\nCop15 in Copenhagen in 2009 produced around 26,000 tCO2e of emissions.\\nAmazon tycoon Jeff Bezos was accused of hypocrisy after telling world leaders that\u00a0going to space made him realise 'how thin the globe's atmosphere is' and\u00a0'the private sector must also play its part to reduce carbon emissions'.\\nThe billionaire has been criticised by Prince William among others for the amount of fossil fuel that space exploration consumes - and arrived at the UN climate change summit in his \u00a348m private jet, fresh\u00a0from celebrating Microsoft founder Bill Gates' 66th birthday on a superyacht off the coast of Turkey.\\nBillionaire Mr Bezos, who earlier this year made a short journey to space in the first crewed flight of his rocket ship, New Shepard, has pledged $2billion (\u00a31.47 billion) for land restoration in Africa, paid as part of the Bezos Earth Fund.\\nHe told delegates:\u00a0'I was told that seeing the Earth from space changes the lens through which you see the world. But I was not prepared for how much that would be true. Looking back at earth from up there, the atmosphere seems so thin. The world so finite and so fragile. Now in this critical year, and what we all know is the decisive decade, we must all stand together to protect our world.'\\nNadia Whittome, Labour MP for Nottingham East, was among Mr Bezos's critics, calling him a 'hypocrite' and writing: 'Amazon has a carbon footprint larger than most countries.'\\nArup's seven-page executive summary of the Cop26 carbon management plan notes the 102,500 tCO2e total includes: business travel during pre-event planning; energy, waste, and water use in the accommodation for all blue zone attendees; and operational emissions from emergency service vehicles.\\nArup said the figure represented 'the best working assessment of the emissions from the event,' based on planning parameters, carbon reporting for previous Cops, and lessons learnt from the foot-printing of previous similar events.\\nFlight radar data also shows that some jets have been flying from Glasgow Airport in Paisley, Renfrewshire, to Glasgow Prestwick Airport in South Ayrshire in order to park - a journey of less than 30 miles.\\nDelegates have been asked to consider low-carbon methods of travel to Cop26.\\nMr Johnson was condemned after returning to London from Glasgow last Tuesday via private jet to reportedly attend a function at a men-only private members' club.\\nDowning Street said the journey was taken with consideration of 'time restraints', but Anneliese Dodds, the Labour party chair, accused Mr Johnson of 'staggering hypocrisy'. When the Prime Minister returned to Glasgow on Wednesday, he did so by train.\\nMonica Lennon, Scottish Labour's spokeswoman for net zero, energy, and transport, said at the time: 'If Cop26 is to deliver the bold change needed, then those involved should lead by example.\\n'Travel emissions were always going to be inevitable, but this stark rise will no doubt raise some eyebrows.\\n'We all have a responsibility to do our part and those setting the rules must be willing to play by them.\\n'Warm words will ring hollow if they're not matched with action.'\\nThe UK Government has pledged COP26 will be carbon neutral, a promise it aims to uphold via the purchase of UNFCCC-recognised offsets such as certified emission reductions.\\nIt says that Glasgow will be the first COP to achieve validation using the PAS2060 international standard on carbon neutrality, and the 'key priority' of its carbon management plan was to 'reduce and avoid emissions'.\\nA spokeswoman for the UK Government said: 'As official UNFCCC figures show, Cop26 is a substantially bigger event than other recent Cops, with over 39,000 participants as against nearly 27,000 at Cop25.\\n'Cop26 will be a carbon neutral event and will be the first Cop to demonstrate carbon neutrality validation through PAS2060, the internationally recognised standard on carbon neutrality.\\n'As part of its analysis, the Government has for the first time included both the full blue and green zone impacts, giving a fuller and more accurate picture of emissions from the site.'\\nThe Government said the Arup report is a baseline assessment which would not fully reflect many of the emission-reduction measures, while final emissions will be confirmed following the event.\\nA definitive total of the event's carbon footprint is expected to be published in coming months, once the data has been received and analysed.\\n** Were you targeted by the protesters?

So it\u2019s okay.\u2019\\nScroll down for videos.\\nGreta Thunberg yesterday slammed Cop26 as 'shameful' and added: 'The world is literally burning.'\\nAnd she accused governments and leaders such as Boris Johnson and Joe Biden of being complicit in the world's ecological problems.\\nShe told those who gathered: 'It is not a secret that Cop26 is a failure. It should be obvious that we cannot solve a crisis with the same methods that got us into it in the first place.\\n'And more and more people are starting to realise this. Many are starting to ask themselves what will it take for the people in power to wake up.\\n'But let's be clear, they are already awake. They know exactly what they are doing. They know exactly what priceless values they are sacrificing to maintain business as usual.\\n'The leaders are not doing nothing. They are actively creating loopholes and shaping frameworks to benefit themselves. And to continue profiting from this destructive system.\\n'This is an active choice by the leaders to continue to let the exploitation of people and nature and the destruction of present and future living conditions to take place.'\\nIn Scotland's second city, demonstrators brought the centre to a standstill by chaining themselves to the\u00a0King George V Bridge, blocking\u00a0pedestrians and cars as they sang\u00a0'power to the people' and unfurled a banner which read:\u00a0'Climate revolution\u2026 or we will lose everything'. Images at the scene of the chaos show Police Scotland officers arresting the protesters.\\nMeanwhile in London, hundreds of demonstrators gathered at the Bank of England for the start of a two-mile march through the city to Trafalgar Square, banging steel drums, chanting 'one solution' and waving Extinction Rebellion banners reading 'tell the truth'.\\nSpeaking on stage at Trafalgar Square, former Green Party leader Sian Berry\u00a0said climate change protesters\u00a0represent 'the majority'.\u00a0To cheers from the huge crowd, she added: 'We are here in our thousands, in our millions, we are most people now, and we will be heard.'\\nAcross the Irish Sea, activists congregated in Belfast ahead of a noisy and colourful march through the city centre before a planned rally at City Hall - while in the Republic of Ireland,\u00a0hundreds of demonstrators gathered at the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin.\\nIn total, some 200 events are taking across the UK and around the world including France, the Netherlands and Australia, according to organisers The Cop26 Coalition. The marches come after Greta Thunberg led schoolchildren and their parents through Glasgow yesterday as they protested against investment in fossil fuels and 'failure' to tackle the climate crisis.\\nOn one stage at the conference, actor Idris Elba warned Cop26 that the climate crisis poses a threat to global food security. Sitting on the same panel, climate justice campaigner Vanessa Nakate of Uganda implored the world to stop burning fossil fuels, the main cause of rising global temperatures.\\nMiss Thunberg, 18, called the Cop26 conference, where countries are meeting in a bid to increase ambition on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, 'a global north greenwash festival, a two-week long celebration of business as usual and blah blah blah'.\\nThe latest demonstrations come midway through the summit, which has seen world leaders gather to set out the action they are taking and commit to curb deforestation, phase out coal, end funding for fossil fuels abroad and cut methane emissions.\\nBut there is still a significant gap between the measures countries have committed to and what is needed to avoid more than 1.5C of warming, beyond which the worst floods, droughts, storms and rising seas of climate change will be felt.\\nCountries are under pressure to agree a process to increase ambition in the next decade, as well as deliver finance for developing countries to cope with the crisis and finalise the last parts of how the global Paris Agreement on climate change will work.\\nAs the protests take place, negotiations continue at Cop26, while the conference is also focusing on the role of nature, land use and agriculture in tackling climate change on Saturday.\\nJason Cook, 54, from Wootton Bassett, said he and two friends were marching through Glasgow because they were tired of hearing 'blah, blah, blah' from leaders on climate action.\\nThe three men had come to the march wearing helmets, each adorned with a sign which said 'blah', echoing the description of the Cop26 summit by Ms Thunberg.\\nDave Knight, 51, from Wiltshire, said the best way to stave off the worst effects of climate change is to end the use and extraction of fossil fuels.\u00a0He also said 'significantly more investment' was needed in renewables.\\nDemonstrators will also be on the streets of central London, as well as for 200 events across the UK and around the world, organisers said.\\nMs Blake, 33, from Kentish Town in north London, said she had joined the protest so the Government would 'make the right decisions for our children' at the Glasgow summit.\\nAnother parent, Valkan Aran, 48, from Stoke Newington, carried his four-year-old daughter Aylin on his shoulders and told local media he wanted to show her how to take action for her future.\\nKatie Harrington was among the crowds who gathered at the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin for a march through the city to Government Buildings.\\n'For me it's extremely important that we use our voices,' said the Dublin woman.\\n'I'm not here for myself, I'm here for future generations. We need our government to actually act on climate change and the climate crisis, not just keep talking and not just keep making plans.\\n'It's really important for us to use our voices and march on these streets so we're heard.'\\nAmong those to address a rally at Belfast City Hall was acclaimed teenage author and naturalist from Co Fermanagh Dara McAnulty.\\n'We are at a junction as a species and there are two paths in front of us,' he told the crowds. 'One - we change our future, we make a difference, we go on the road to restorative justice and climate action.\\n'Or we can go down the path of further destruction and inevitably the demise of our species.'\\nThe events on the island were part of a global day of action aimed at increasing pressure on world leaders attending the Cop26 conference on climate change in Glasgow.\\nCatherine O'Rourke from Liverpool was in Dublin to visit her daughter. She said she felt compelled to come down and join in the protest.\\n'I am very concerned about the future for my grandchildren and my great grandchildren and we've got to make a difference,' she said. 'We can't just hope for it, we've got to do it. We've got to make our governments wake up before it's too late. It's already nearly too late. I had to come - I'd no choice.'\\nSusan Rossney from Dublin credited the Irish government with making 'good progress' on climate action. But she added: 'It still bears repeating every day and in every possible format that everyone has to take action on the climate crisis.\\n'It's for us now, it's for the entire world and it's so unjust that so much pollution is being created by the developed world and the developing world is bearing the brunt of this.'\\nDaithi McKay, the vice chair of the NI Climate Coalition, helped organise the event in Belfast.\\n'We've heard a lot of promises, we've heard a lot of pledges,' he said of Cop26. 'But we need much more than that - we need immediate action.'\\nGreta Thunberg dismissed Cop26 as a 'greenwashing campaign' for politicians as she joined Emma Watson on a climate discussion panel.\\nMiss Thunberg, who also this week denounced Government figures who gathered in the Scottish city for 'whatever the f*** they are doing in there', attended the New York Times' 'Climate Hub' - a forum for discussing 'actionable climate strategies', also based in Glasgow.\\nThe Swedish eco activist heaped scorn the UN's Cop26 conference, branding it a 'greenwash campaign, a PR campaign' for businesses and politicians to pretend they are taking action, but not follow through.\\nIn a 'surprise session' curated by Emma Watson, Miss Thunberg said: 'Since we are so far from what actually we needed, I think what would be considered a success would be if people realize what a failure this COP is.'\\nShe and other young female activists, including Malala Yousafzai and Vanessa Nakate, also discussed the role women have played in bringing together protests and demanding action from world leaders, the New York Times reports.\\nChloe Ferguson, the chair of Queen's University Students' Union Climate Action Group, said street protests could have a 'massive impact'. 'When we look at what politicians and what our leaders respond to, they listen to what's going to cause them the most bother publicly,' she said.\\nThe marches come after thousands of youth activists, including Miss Thunberg, marched through Glasgow on Friday to decry investment in fossil fuels and failure to tackle the climate crisis.\\nMiss Thunberg called the Cop26 conference, where countries are meeting in a bid to increase ambition on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, 'a global greenwash festival, a two-week long celebration of business as usual and blah blah blah'.\\nThe young Swedish activist has digressed from her usual calmly mannered rhetoric and opted for a few more choice words about politicians and how they have reacted to climate change.\\nThe teenage activist spoke about people being 'p****d off' by protests and was also filmed singing 'You can shove your climate crisis up your a***' while outside Cop26.\\nMiss Thunberg gave a passionate and foul-mouthed speech last week, telling demonstrators: 'Inside Cop, there are just politicians and people in power pretending to take our future seriously... No more blah blah blah, no more whatever the f*** they are doing inside there!'\\nAs heads of Government from around the world discussed what could be done to save the planet from ruin, the Swedish eco activist appeared to lay the blame for looming natural disasters squarely on them as she riled up her fellow activists with a chant of: 'You can shove your climate crisis up your a***'.\\nHowever, US special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry said there was a greater sense of urgency and focus at the Cop26 talks than ever.\\nHowever, he added he was 'frustrated' over the pace of climate action and warned it was 'not job done' at the conference.\\nThe latest demonstrations come midway through the Cop26 summit, which has seen about 120 leaders gather in Glasgow to set out the action they are taking and commit to curb deforestation, phase out coal, end funding for fossil fuels abroad and cut methane emissions.\\nYet there is still a significant gap between the measures countries have committed to and what is needed to avoid more than 1.5C of warming, beyond which the worst floods, droughts, storms and rising seas of climate change will be felt.\\nCountries are under pressure to agree a to increased ambition in tackling global warming in the next decade, as well as to deliver money for developing countries to cope with the crisis and finalise the last parts of how the global Paris Agreement on climate change will work.\\nAs the protests take place, negotiations continue at Cop26, while the conference is also focusing on the role of nature, land use and agriculture in tackling climate change on Saturday.\\nOne of the protesters taking part in Saturday's demonstrations, Mikaela Loach, is a young Scottish climate activist who is challenging the UK's North Sea oil and gas expansion in court.\\nShe said: 'Many thousands of us are marching right across the world today to demand immediate and serious action. We're clear that warm words are not good enough and that the next week of talks must see a serious ramping up of concrete plans.'\\nThe demonstrations come after months of eco-warriors from Insulate Britain, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, have divided public opinion about their extreme protesting methods.\\nThe climate enthusiasts blocked roads by sitting down or gluing themselves to the tarmac, causing havoc for commuters.\\nJust last week the group were ridiculed for blocking an insulation lorry carrying the exact materials they want installed in homes across the country as activists took their sit-down protests to the heart of Westminster.", "image": [["Mounted police patrol during a global day of action on climate change in Glasgow",

'They\u2019re declaring war against those that are protesting.'\\n'I think it's going to be threatened by groups that feel government isn't going anything,' Suzuki said.\\nOn Monday, two journalists who were arrested while covering Indigenous protests against British Columbia pipelines on Friday were freed on bail.\\nThe arrest of photographer Amber Bracken and filmmaker Michael Toledano drew backlash from press groups and\u00a0British Columbia Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth.\\nThey were arrested along with\u00a0with 13 protesters who were demonstrating against a pipeline being built in the remote region of British Columbia to a ship terminal that is being developed by major companies including Shell, Petronas and PetroChina, according to the New York Times.\\nThe pipeline is more than halfway finished, the Associated Press reports.\\nSuzuki has been a climate activist for decades, urging leaders and the public to take action to mitigate its effects on sea level rise and the future of human civilization.\\nScientific consensus on global warning is overwhelming.\\n'Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree : Climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities,' according to NASA.\\nBy Monday, local and national political leaders had condemned Suzuki's dicey words.\\n'This type of rhetoric is dangerous and undemocratic,' tweeted Erin O'Toole, the head of the\u00a0 Conservative Party of Canada.\\n'It implies that energy workers and infrastructure should be targets for acts of terrorism.
