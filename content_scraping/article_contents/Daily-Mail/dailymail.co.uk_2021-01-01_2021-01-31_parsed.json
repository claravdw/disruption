At the moment they are threatening our lives.\\n'When we were digging the tunnel, we had drainage systems all along so that the water on the surface wouldn't fall down into the tunnel and cause collapse. They have just removed our drainage systems so our tunnel is collapsing.'\\nBut she added: 'We're all still in good health despite the dirty tricks. It's been cold since the eviction team brought in a huge compressor and sent a hose down blasting air along the tunnels.\\n'We've got lots of sleeping bags, though, and we're taking it in shifts, with some sleeping, others awake having some food.\\n'We have enough stores to last six weeks. I'm surviving on rice and tins of jackfruit, as well as pastries and other stuff collected from skips.'\\nWhile many would struggle to imagine living without home comforts for a day, the teenager is tougher than most.\\nDespite her privileged family connections \u2013 her great-great-grandfather was the 5th Earl of Rosslyn and her great-aunt was the late racehorse owner Lady Serena Rothschild, wife of Jacob, 4th Baron Rothschild \u2013 Blue has spent large parts of her life on Gometra, a windswept 'off-grid' island owned by her father, where there is no electricity, no school, no shop and no GP.\\nShe is also no stranger to trouble, having spent the start of her 17th birthday in a custody cell for blocking a road during a school strike in Trafalgar Square \u2013 and she has yet to return to her lessons at King Alfred School in Golders Green, North London, where fees are \u00a36,686 a term.\\nDubbed 'Britain's Greta Thunberg' \u2013 a nickname she hates \u2013 questions are being asked about whether she is being manipulated by her parents and those around her, similar to accusations levelled at the young Swedish campaigner's family.\\nIt is a sentiment hotly denied by Mr Sandford, who made his fortune through inherited property and became laird of Gometra when he purchased the small island west of Mull 30 years ago in pursuit of carbon-neutral living.\\nIn a rejection of all mod-cons that would leave many baffled, he washes his clothes in a bucket with his feet and fights off the cold by wearing multiple layers of clothing.\\nHaving not flown for years, travelling between the island and his second home in London can take more than 13 hours. He navigates an eight-mile trek along a dirt track on Gometra, and also uses a folding bicycle, two ferries and two trains.\\nLast night, speaking from his island home, more than 500 miles away from the stand-off, Mr Sandford denied manipulating his children, saying 'nothing could be further from the truth'.\\nHe said: 'They have completely outclassed me in their protests, which proves it isn't coming from me. I am always begging them to be careful and I sometimes feel like I am going to collapse with fear, but I am also so proud of what they are achieving.\\n'I'm a parent, not an eco-warrior, and I am terrified of the future we are cooking up for our children. I have been going through a really dark and miserable place knowing I could lose them.'\\nMr Sandford says that since moving to Gometra, he has tried to live firmly by his beliefs, passing them on to Blue and Lazer (real names Isla and Lachlan), as well as his two older children \u2013 Savannah, 22, who is at the protest site but not in the tunnels, and Cato, 31, a physicist whose research focuses on reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\\nMr Sandford \u2013 whose late Old Etonian father, Jeremy, wrote the 1966 TV classic Cathy Come Home, and whose mother is respected author Nell Dunn, 84 \u2013 also believes in reducing waste and has given his children festive gifts of street rubbish, which he sees as reclaimed art.\\nHis long-term relationship with his children's mother ended some years ago and it was a court order brought by her that ruled they must be schooled in London.\\nIt was Mr Sandford's interest in saving the environment that led to Blue going to her first demo with him when she was nine, and she was hooked.\\nFather and daughter have protested together in London against climate change and staged a protest on Gometra in 2019, by blocking the causeway to the island from Ulva, in solidarity with Fiji, Kinbati, Nauru, Micronesia, the Marshall islands, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Timor Leste and Tonga to declare a climate and ecological emergency.\\nSince then, despite only recently becoming eligible to vote, the schoolgirl has been a key member of the youth wing of Extinction Rebellion in London.\\nMr Sandford has declared Gometra a 'Hope Island' and is aiming for it to become carbon neutral in the next four years.\\nIt is also home to Rhoda Munro, the postmistress (Gometra has its own stamp), and the Primrose family \u2013 a mum, dad and one daughter, who are the latest in a series of people who have tried living there over the years.\\nBut even getting to and from the island to the Scottish mainland is a significant challenge. With no cars, the most direct route is in a small boat\u2026 if the sea conditions allow.\\nThe HS2 rail project, which is set to link London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, is being promoted as a means of 'rebalancing' the economy and helping to lower carbon emissions by reducing traffic on the roads.\\nBut protesters say the line will destroy or irreparably damage 108 ancient woodlands and 693 wildlife sites, and that Euston Square Gardens will be built over by a temporary taxi rank before being sold to developers.\\nHS2 insists the most ancient woodland will remain untouched and has criticised the 'illegal' occupation, saying it presents a danger to staff and enforcement officers.\\nThe current taxi rank in Euston Square Gardens West is required for preparatory works, including utility diversions, to enable connection improvements with the Underground network and the construction of Euston's new station.\\nYesterday, an HS2 spokesman said: 'I can deny that we are flooding the tunnel. We are pumping air so that the protesters can breathe.\\n'The activists have dug a crude and poorly constructed tunnel. In the past 24 hours, the weather conditions have worsened and further heavy rain and sleet is forecast, which could lead to the tunnel becoming even more unstable.\\n'We are concerned the occupants of the tunnel are now impeding efforts to help them, shutting themselves off underground, and preventing us from checking air quality as we supply them with air.\\n'As carbon dioxide can build up in the tunnel, they are putting themselves in even greater danger.\\n'HS2, paramedics and the Met Police have all spoken to those in the tunnel to warn them of the dangers.\\n'These activists have had multiple opportunities to remove themselves from the danger.

but Greenpeace warn it is 'destroys the seabed'.\\nAny bottom trawlers trying to fish over the boulders will get their gear snagged and ruined on the rocks, though passing marine traffic will not be affected.\\nThe conservation charity said it would continue to drop boulders until the Government introduces stricter restrictions on fishing in these areas.\\n\\nBut the charity warns only five per cent of all UK marine-protected areas currently ban bottom trawling.\\nAs well as destroying anemones, corals, sponges, fish and crustaceans, bottom trawling releases carbon from the muddy and sandy sediments into the ocean, and potentially the atmosphere where it adds to climate change.\\nThe release of carbon by bottom trawling across the UK continental shelf between 2016 and 2040 could cost up to \u00a39 billion to mitigate through cutting emissions in other areas of the economy.\\nContinued disturbance of the carbon stored in offshore marine protected areas alone could cost nearly \u00a31 billion over the next 25 years, the report estimates.\\nA ban on bottom trawling leaves carbon stores undisturbed and is beneficial to the delicate ecosystems that exist on seabeds, with previous research finding\u00a0marine life can be restored to healthy levels within five years.\\nDr Jean-Luc Solandt, principal specialist in marine-protected areas at the Marine Conservation Society, said: 'While bottom trawling is still allowed we will continue to release more carbon from the seafloor and prevent complex carbon-storing habitats from recovering.\\n'In order to battle the climate emergency there has to be limits on where fishing of this kind can take place.'\\n'Without a ban on this form of fishing, these areas of our seas simply aren't recovering and we're missing a crucial opportunity to combat climate change and ensure there are indeed plenty more fish in the sea,' he adds.\\nAn Environment Department (Defra) spokesperson said: 'As an independent coastal state, the UK can now review which vessels can access and fish our waters.\\n'All boats must abide by our rules around sustainability and protection of our marine protected areas (MPAs).\\n'Last year, the Government commissioned a review of how we protect our MPAs and we are carefully considering whether there is a case for increased protections for these areas.'\\nCommenting on the new report,\u00a0Chris Thorne, an oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said:\u00a0'This is yet more evidence that the UK's marine protected areas are not fit for purpose.\\n'How can this Government allow destructive industrial bottom trawlers to rip up almost all of our protected areas of seabed, harming marine life and ecosystems and disturbing vital carbon stores, while still claiming to be a 'global ocean champion'?\\n'The time has come for the Government to stop hiding behind empty statements, and deliver on its Brexit promise to properly protect our seas.\\n'A robust network of marine protected areas, where all destructive fishing like bottom trawling is banned, would make the UK a genuine world leader in marine protection and could also help us combat the climate emergency.\\n'Now is the time for the Government to deliver.'", "image": [["Pictured, a curled octopus (Eledone cirrhosa) in a horse mussel bed in Shetland, Scotland, UK in August 2020.

An HS2 spokeswoman blasted the 'illegal' occupation and said it presented a 'danger' to HS2 staff and High Court enforcement officers.\\n\\n\\nSwampy\\nSwampy, whose real name is Daniel Marc Hooper, became a household name in the 1990s during a variety of environmental protests.\\nHe is best known for spending a week in a complex series of tunnels dug in the path of the expansion of the A30 road in Fairmile, Devon in 1996.\\nResisting attempts at eviction by police, Swampy was eventually removed from the network of man-made tunnels.\\nIn 1997, Swampy took part in another tunnel protest against the building of a second runway at Manchester Airport, and has also been involved with the Trident nuclear submarine protest camp at Faslane, Scotland.\\nIn 2019, Swampy took part in an Extinction Rebellion protest by attaching himself to a concrete block at the entrance to the Valero Energy fuel refinery in Pembrokeshire.\\nLast October, he was arrested at Jones Hill Wood in Buckinghamshire, having occupied a treehouse to prevent trees being chopped down on the route of HS2.\\nDr\u00a0Larch Maxey\\nDr Larch Maxey is an Extinction Rebellion activist who was a full-time volunteer for the radical group in 2019 and helped organise hunger strike occupations that year.\\nIn an interview with the Guardian, the long-time climate activist said he had a\u00a0PhD in sustainability and was a geography lecturer and post-doctoral researcher for 17 years.\\nHowever, he said he had no income and described himself as a 'relaxed freegan' - someone who only eats food that would be going to waste.\\nThe Metropolitan Police said officers were deployed only to help bailiffs should there be any 'breach of the peace'.\\nThe HS2 rail project, which is set to link London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, and rebalance the UK's economy, has been called 'expensive, wasteful and destructive' by environmentalists.\\nAnti-HS2 protesters claim the line will destroy or irreparably damage 108 ancient woodlands and 693 wildlife sites, and that Euston Square Gardens will be built over with a temporary taxi rank before being sold off to developers.\\nThey added that 'tree protectors' were prepared to occupy the tunnels, dug 'in secret' over the last few months, and would stay underground 'for as long as it takes to stop HS2'.\\nInfamous eco-warrior Swampy is among a hardcore group of HS2 protestors holed up in one of the tunnels.\\nOne of the activists above ground who gave his name as Tellheed, 52, from Manchester, said: 'They all went down there yesterday before the bailiffs turned up.\\n'They locked themselves in the shed and went down the tunnel. Swampy is one of the guys down there.\\n'He's done a lot for the environment and will continue until the government starts listening.'\\nHe added: 'The police don't like that Swampy's back because they know what lengths he goes to. He's not an amateur.'\\nSwampy appeared in court last November under his real name to deny a charge of aggravated trespass in connection with a treetop protest against the HS2 rail link.\\nHe is accused of climbing trees and staying in Jones' Hill Wood in Wendover, near Aylesbury, Bucks, with other protestors for four days.\\nThe 47-year-old was pictured camped 30ft up a tree last October in a protest against the planned felling of the woodland to make way for the controversial high speed rail line.\\nHooper, of Cwmdu, Llandeilo, Wales, appeared alongside four other demonstrators.\\nHe was released on conditional bail, provided he did not go into a HS2 site or building and did not 'interfere with the workings' of any HS2 work.\\nHe is due to stand trial in connection with the treetop protest at High Wycombe Magistrates Court in May.\\nSwampy first hit the headlines in 1996, when he spent seven days and seven nights living in a tunnel dug by campaigners to stop the \u00a350million A30 dual carriageway link road in Devon.\\nThe father-of-four briefly re-emerged in 2019 to join an Extinction Rebellion protest in Pembrokeshire, Wales, where he obstructed access to an oil refinery by attaching himself to a concrete block.\\nIndependent experts have estimated that the HS2 rail line will cost in excess of\u00a0\u00a3100billion. However, HS2 disputes this, and claims it will cost up to \u00a398billion.\\nMailOnline understands that HS2 has\u00a0taken legal temporary possession of Euston Square Gardens East in\u00a0order to relocate the temporary taxi rank for Euston Station.\\nThe current location of the taxi rank - Euston Square Gardens West - is required for preparatory works, including significant utilities diversions, to enable the improvements to the connections between Euston Square and Euston Underground stations, as well as for the construction of Euston's new station.\\nHS2 served notices on the legal owners and occupiers of the land - London Borough of Camden, Network Rail and Transport for London - last month, stating our intention to take the site under the powers of Temporary Possession.\\nThe Woodland Trust, a conservation charity, calls HS2 'a grave threat to the UK's ancient woods, with 108 at risk of loss or damage'.\\nBut HS2 says only 0.29 square kilometres (0.11 square miles) of ancient woodland will be lost during the first phase. HS2 says it will reduce journey times between London and northern England and add capacity to Britain's crowded rail network.\\nCritics question whether HS2 is worth its ballooning price tag - now reported more than \u00a3100billion - especially after a pandemic that might permanently change people's travel habits.\\nThe first phase linking London and Birmingham is due to open between 2029 and 2033, according to HS2 Ltd.\\nIn September Boris Johnson joined the front line to see work begin on HS2, as shovels hit the ground in Solihull.\\nHe said the 'incredible' scheme, launched in 2009, would deliver not just '22,000 jobs now, but tens of thousands more high-skilled jobs in the decades ahead'.\\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs last year the first trains may not be up and running until 2031. The project has been shrouded in controversy since its birth, with campaigners warning it is 'decimating countryside and creating a huge financial burden'.\\nIn April wildlife presenter Chris Packham lost a High Court bid to stop ancient woodlands being dug up for the project.\\nThere was also uproar when HS2's annual report revealed each person working on it was costing the taxpayer almost \u00a3100,000 on average.\\nIt also revealed chief executive Mark Thurston was paid \u00a3659,416 last year \u2013 four times as much as the PM. More than \u00a33.3million was spent on 'travel and subsistence' and \u00a3802,000 on recruitment fees.\\nIt is understood that the notice period is over and HS2 is not entitled the take possession of the land, and any occupants on the land are now trespassing.\\nThe current ban on evictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic is not applicable and the police, landowners and those with legal possession of the land have the power to remove trespassers using minimum force.\\nHS2 bosses also insist that most ancient woodland will 'remain intact'. Responding to the Euston Gardens encampment, a spokesperson\u00a0said: 'To ensure HS2 is able to deliver its major benefits to the UK on time, certain works must take place at designated times.\\n'HS2 has taken legal temporary possession of Euston Square Gardens East in order to progress with works necessary for the construction of the new Euston station. These protests are a danger to the safety of the protestors, our staff and the general public, and put unnecessary strain on the emergency services during a pandemic.\\n'The protestors are currently trespassing on land that is legally possessed by HS2.'\\nThe Health and Safety Executive confirmed that it was in talks with HS2 over the operation to breach the protestor's tunnel, after official complaints were submitted to the agency.\\nA spokesman said: 'HSE is aware of the situation and is in liaison with HS2 in order to review any plans that would affect workers, protesters or rescue personnel.'\\nThe first phase of the rail link between London and Birmingham will not open until 2028 - while the second, to Manchester and Leeds, has been delayed until 2035-40.\\nHS2 Rebellion called on the Government to scrap the scheme 'before it is too late' and argued for a National Citizens Assembly to 'lead the way out of the climate and ecological emergency'.\\nOne protester, Blue Sanford, 18, from London, said: 'I'm angry that the Government is still effectively ignoring this crisis despite declaring a climate and ecological emergency two years ago.\\n'I'm in this tunnel because they are irresponsibly putting my life at risk from the climate and ecological emergency. They are behaving in a way that is so reckless and unsafe that I don't feel they are giving us any option but to protest in this way to help save our own lives and the lives of all the people round the world.'\\nHoward Rees, who was evicted from the site by police early this morning said: 'The police cleared the site using Covid legislation early this morning so now there are only the people who are in the trees or in the tunnel.\\n'This was home for some of us since August, well before lockdown, so how the police could use this legislation we are not sure.' The 40-year-old did not see any violence as police cleared the scene.\\nDr Larch Maxey, a climate scientist and Extinction Rebellion activist in the Euston Square Gardens camp, said: 'The bailiffs arrived at about 4.30am and we had a scramble to get down the tunnel safely when the bailiffs arrived. They were in the next room when we barricaded ourselves in and shut the trap door.\\n'We are going to stay here as long as it takes. We have some power packs, food and water, some tools to repair the tunnel as well as some books, juggling balls and playing cards to keep us entertained.\\n'We can hear the people outside cheering us on as they drive past, that atmosphere is amazing.'\\nSpeaking later on Wednesday, Maxey said:\u00a0: 'I've been working in academia for 25 years, have written several books and published academic papers.\\n'Now I work full-time on this. Are you going to stand by while the world burns?\\nI'm stood four feet from the top of the tunnel, at the top of the down shaft, looking at a gaping hole.\u00a0I'm actually going a little lower as we speak.\u00a0Obviously no one would ask to be underground,' he said.\\n'But also we didn't ask to be in a climate emergency.\u00a0I'm scared of not having enough access to sunlight, of not seeing my partner or friends.\u00a0But most of all I'm scared of the way the bailiffs are going to carry out the eviction.\\n'There are three others in the shaft with me and I don't know who's in the tunnel.\u00a0It was about 9 feet 4 inches deep when I measured it.\u00a0I will spend as much time down here as it takes to stop HS2.'\\nAn HS2 protester who was brought down from a tree said he 'did not want to risk arrest'.\\nThe man, who gave his name as Gibbon, was lowered from the tree on an aerial platform with an enforcement agent shortly after 1pm. The activist and musician, from north London, said he had spent four weeks in the park.\\nHe said: 'They made me come down and I did not resist because I did not want to risk arrest. Luckily they held their word it seems, I did not get arrested.'\\nAsked what the enforcement officers said to make him come down, Gibbon said: 'In the end they will do it forcefully and I don't need to be hurt and prefer not to be hurt. I'm a peaceful protester.\\n'I delayed the eviction, I drew attention to the media and to the public that this HS2 project is absolutely ridiculous, nobody wants it and what they are doing should have already stopped.'\\nBradley, 18, from London, arrived at the camp this morning to voice his anger at HS2. He said: 'We're protesting the HS2 project which is bad for the environment and future generations. I believe this project is absolutely going against the direction we as a species should be going in.\\n'The bailiffs are putting our lives at risk and this doesn't need to happen now. That's their choice, if they want come steal community land and put us in danger.'\\nChristopher, 65, from Wanstead, east London, has been visiting the camp on and off since they started protesting. He said: 'We want to stop HS2 to protect our wildlife.\\n'There's a lot of wrong doing going on here. I haven't been down the tunnels, but I have seen what's coming out. It's taken them three or four months I reckon.\\n'I got a message on Facebook this morning about the eviction. I've spent a lot of time on the front line so I was expecting it to be honest.'\\nJosh, 22, who has spent a number of nights in the camp over the past few months said: 'I came because it's a lot more beautiful as a park than a taxi rank. It's a way for me to voice my message which has been ignored by the company. We have toilets and a working kitchen up here.\\n'There haven't been any reporter cases of Covid in this camp and as you can see I'm wearing a mask. My biggest fear is when these guys come in and try nab me.\\n'But if they want to get close, that's their choice and I'm willing to take that risk.'\\nTellheed, 53, from Manchester who joined the camp last Thursday, said: 'I knew it was the end so I've come down to support them.\\n'There's a big tunnel with about five people down there locked on. It's about six feet deep and looks like a tunnel out of The Great Escape.\\n'They used shovels and little picks to dig. You can access it through the hut, but it's pretty hidden.\\n'If they had used it on The Great Escape, the whole prison would have got out. They're going to be down there for a while because they have bedding, toilets and stocks of food.'\\nSharon Banzhaf, 64, has visited the camp twice to deliver supplies. She said: 'It's actually quite scary in there because there are no lights.\\n'I brought them some sleeping bags, socks and jumpers last week. They dig at night and sleep during the day.'\\nAfter watching their friend be forcibly removed by bailiffs Josh, 22, said: 'It makes me feel frustrated.\\n'Our approach has always been peaceful. We have not been violent with anyone and we try to be respectful, so it's frustrating when we don't get that same level of respect back.'\\nLavender, 25, from East London, spent the night in a tent 30 metres above the ground with seven other people to protest HS2's new taxi rank.\\nThe protestor, who wouldn't give her surname, said: 'They just asked me do you want to come down willingly or we can use reasonable force?\\n'They were surprised there were seven of us up there. I arrived at around 10 o'clock last night and went up in the tree around 1am.\\n'I've been inside the tunnel but I get a bit claustrophobic. It's somewhere I couldn't stay for a long time so I'm really humbled by those in there. They are doing great job.'\\nSome people, who resisted, were arrested, the protesters say. One of the protesters, who did not wish to be named said: 'I didn't get much sleep.\\n'The last people came up the tree at 3am and the eviction started about an hour later. I chose to go up the tree because you need expertise to do the tunnel.\\n'I take Covid very seriously but certain things are important enough to sacrifice your safety. You can't get these trees or the money which could be spent on the NHS back.'\\nA spokesperson for the Met told MailOnline: 'Six arrests have been made at the site of a protest in Euston Square Gardens. One man was arrested for breach of the peace and a short time later was de-arrested and released.\\n'A woman was arrested under the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act. One man was arrested under the Public Order Act, while a further three men were arrested under the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020. A police presence remains at the site to prevent further potential breaches of the peace and to uphold Covid legislation.'\\nVideo footage from inside, filmed by activists, shows a cramped, winding passage with wooden props against its walls. In some parts they can be seen removing loose earth with just a trowel.\\nA spokesman for the group said Swampy, real name Daniel Hooper, had been an 'invaluable source of expertise' in helping to dig the tunnel. The group said last night that it expects to face eviction 'imminently'.\\nIt said tunnellers 'worked around the clock, using pickaxes, shovels, buckets and shifts of two to 12 people at a time'. The entrance is concealed by a 'fortified stronghold', complete with a tower built from pallets, which activists have nicknamed Buckingham Pallets.\\nActivists are living in a main chamber of the tunnel, with stashes of tinned food and vegetables stored along its length.\\nBlue told the BBC the tunnel was 'very dangerous and life threatening' but it was their 'best defence' against being evicted. 'It is not about us martyring ourselves, it is about delaying and stopping HS2,' he said.\\n'This is the only way I can effect change, I would sacrifice everything for the climate ecological emergency to not be happening.'\\nThe spokeswoman for HS2 Ltd said: 'Illegal action such as this is costly to the taxpayer and a danger to the safety of the activists, HS2 staff, High Court enforcement officers and the general public, as well as putting unnecessary strain on the emergency services during the pandemic.\\n'Safety is our first priority when taking possession of land and removing illegal encampments.'\\nShe said HS2 will provide 'a cleaner, greener way to travel, helping to cut the number of cars and lorries on our roads, reduce demand for domestic flights, and help the country to cut its carbon emissions in the fight against climate change'.\\nThe spokeswoman added that HS2 has been approved by MPs on 'multiple occasions', will support Britain's economic recovery and is providing thousands of jobs.\\nConstruction work started in September on Phase 1 of HS2 from London to Birmingham. Phase 2a is planned to run from Birmingham to Crewe, and Phase 2b from Crewe to Manchester, and from Birmingham to Leeds.\\nThe Government-commissioned Oakervee Review considered a cost estimate for the project by an external consultant that put its final bill at \u00a3106.6 billion in fourth quarter of 2015 prices.\\nThe review commissioned a comparative analysis of this estimate and those by HS2 Ltd and said characteristics of major rail infrastructure cost plans, according to evidence from Network Rail, were 'not evident' in the external estimate.\\nThe review said it seemed amounts allocated towards major construction works were too low, and amounts allocated towards rail systems seemed too high.\\nDespite it running tens of billions of pounds over budget and several years behind schedule, Boris Johnson gave the green light for the railway in February 2020.", "image": [["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/01/27/10/38538202-9191919-image-a-107_1611744357192.jpg"],

Homeless advocates dispute a connection between alleged offences and camp.", "text": "The Western Australian government is set to shut down Fremantle's controversial tent city after two alleged child sexual assaults were linked to the growing homeless camp.\\nMore than 100 vagrants staying in up to 75 tents set up in\u00a0Pioneer Park have now been offered temporary hotel stays as authorities prepare to dismantle the site.\\nThe move comes after police\u00a0responded to 77 calls for assistance since Boxing Day, linking\u00a0a number of serious allegations including assaults and child sex offences to the camp.\\nBut homeless advocates dispute the connection between some of the alleged criminal activity and the camp, claiming Mark McGowan's Labor government has failed to address the housing crisis in any lasting way.\\nThe Premier remained staunch on the issue Friday and\u00a0renewed his claims\u00a0that those living in tent city are being lured there by 'professional protesters' and 'anarchists'\u00a0from groups like radical environmental action network Extinction Rebellion.\\n'They've been pulling people out of supported accommodation with false promises and putting them in this campsite,' he said.\\n'It's a rotten exploitation of vulnerable and needy people that the organisers have engaged in here.'\\nEarlier this week McGowan said\u00a0the homeless families crowding into tent cities were being attracted to the site by extravagant ham lunches.\\n'They're organising lunches there with ham off the bone and quite attractive food in order to attract people there,' he said.\\n'Rather than helping people, they are exploiting them\u2026 they are coordinating this as some sort of protest movement.'\\nA working group set up to deal with the problem detailed the circumstances of 100 people, aged 21 to 71, living there and found 90 per cent were genuinely homeless.\\nOfficers have issued move-on notices and fines for alcohol and minor criminal offences at two tent cities in Pioneer Park and in the CBD, as\u00a0locals raised fears about growing violence, theft, and piles of rubbish and discarded syringes.\\nPolice said on Thursday there were 'reportable incidents in the area' in recent weeks resulting in significant charges being laid.\\nThey included two men, aged 44 and 41, allegedly raping two girls aged 13 and 14 on Fleet St in the early hours of January 1.\\nThe 44-year-old was charged with rape and indecent dealing of a child aged 13 to 16. His alleged accomplice was charged with indecent dealing.\\n'Some of the charges are very, very disturbing,' Mr McGowan told reporters.\\n'This is a bad situation. Innocent members of the public are being victimised, the local businesses are being attacked.'\\nPolice also highlighted several alleged assaults in Fremantle, including on a man struck in the head with a rock at Pioneer Park and a 51-year-old woman threatened with a knife, as well as a police officer being attacked.\\nWA's Department of Communities confirmed it had offered rough sleepers emergency accommodation in response to 'serious and growing public safety issues'.\\n'Every person who is willing to accept support and is sleeping rough at Pioneer Park is being offered appropriate accommodation,' director general Michelle Andrews said in a statement.\\nBut\u00a0House the Homeless WA spokesman Jesse Noakes said there had been a systemic failure by the McGowan government to address the state's housing crisis.\\n'One week's accommodation is not a solution to homelessness. It is a road to nowhere,' he said.\\nMr Noakes said 40 vulnerable people had died on the streets of Perth last year.\\nFremantle mayor Brad Pettitt - who is running for the Greens at the March state election - also took aim at the state government, noting that rates of rough sleeping has increased since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.\\n'It is the premier and the WA state government who are responsible for ensuring this housing and the necessary wrap around services are provided and, so far, they have failed to do so,' he said.\\nBut Mr McGowan said the state government was powerless to clear out the camp as Fremantle council had allowed them to stay, so they were not trespassing.\\n'The council needs to step up here... the council has created a difficult and dangerous situation,' he said.\\nMr Pettit remains confident the situation can be resolved without force.\\n'We are meeting regularly with the police in terms of how they deal with it. They are quite clear they have no interest in resolving this by going in with force,' he said.\\nWith voters set to go the polls on March 13, homelessness is expected to be a key election issue.\\nShelter WA estimates there are about 15,000 on the social housing wait list and more than 1,000 sleeping on the street.\\nAt the same time rental vacancies in the resource rich state have reached record lows.\\nIndigenous leaders and homeless advocates, including Megan Krakouer from the National Suicide Prevention and Trauma Recovery Project, have also questioned the premier's claim that there are adequate beds available for the homeless.\\n'I strongly urge Mr McGowan come to the Fremantle camp and speak to the people themselves to find out the truth about desperate people abandoned by his government,' Ms Krakouer said.", "image": [["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/01/22/14/38353990-0-image-a-17_1611325744167.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/01/22/13/38350674-9176039-image-a-3_1611320905500.jpg"], ["A notice board with guidelines for the street kitchen is seen at the tent city in Pioneer Park, Fremantle", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/01/22/15/38355376-9176039-image-a-5_1611328110116.jpg"], ["A general view of the tent city in Pioneer Park.

HS2 says it will reduce journey times between London and northern England and add capacity to Britain's crowded rail network.\\nCritics question whether HS2 is worth its ballooning price tag - now reported more than \u00a3100billion - especially after a pandemic that might permanently change people's travel habits.\\nThe first phase linking London and Birmingham is due to open between 2029 and 2033, according to HS2 Ltd.\\nIn September Boris Johnson joined the front line to see work begin on HS2, as shovels hit the ground in Solihull.\\nHe said the 'incredible' scheme, launched in 2009, would deliver not just '22,000 jobs now, but tens of thousands more high-skilled jobs in the decades ahead'.\\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs last year the first trains may not be up and running until 2031. The project has been shrouded in controversy since its birth, with campaigners warning it is 'decimating countryside and creating a huge financial burden'.\\nIn April wildlife presenter Chris Packham lost a High Court bid to stop ancient woodlands being dug up for the project.\\n\\nThe HS2 rail project, which is set to link London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, and rebalance the UK's economy, has been called 'expensive, wasteful and destructive' by environmentalists.\\nAnti-HS2 protesters claim the line will destroy or irreparably damage 108 ancient woodlands and 693 wildlife sites, and that Euston Square Gardens will be built over with a temporary taxi rank before being sold off to developers.\\nThey added that 'tree protectors' were prepared to occupy the tunnels, dug 'in secret' over the last few months, and would stay underground 'for as long as it takes to stop HS2'.\\nIndependent experts have estimated that the HS2 rail line will cost in excess of \u00a3100billion.
