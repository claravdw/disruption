It is scaremongering rather than inspiring, and while for a time I aligned myself with their world view \u2014 and their tactics \u2014 in recent months I have come to see things differently.\\nIn fact, after years as a member of one campaigning group or another, I now believe passionately that environmentalism \u2014 that umbrella term for the loose collection of organisations that have existed for decades trying to bring about an end to climate change \u2014 has failed.\\nBy that I mean that for all the picketing, and the direct action, and the exhortations to use less fuel, fly less and conserve water, nothing has really made a difference to how we choose to live. Day after day, we still hear of energy crises around the world, increasing drought and wildfires, and species facing extinction.\\nTurn the clock back 30 years, and I was hearing much the same messages in the classroom at my Birmingham comprehensive school. Some of the words and the numbers may have changed, but not much else.\\nIt certainly lit a fire in me: growing up in a working-class, inner-city area, the daughter of immigrants from the Punjab who worked punishing hours in factories to make ends meet, I was an unlikely budding environmental campaigner.\\nBut by the time I went to university I helped found a green organisation and later joined the Green Party.\\nFrom there I joined another small climate action group, but when it died out I stayed out of activism for a while to concentrate on my own freelance writing, taking a Masters in science communication because, unlike the slightly \u2018crazy hippy\u2019 connotations my unusual name may conjure, I\u2019ve always been a firm believer in following the science.\\nDisorder\\nIt\u2019s one reason I was first attracted to XR. Their mantra \u2014 initially anyway \u2014 was \u2018listen to the scientists\u2019. So when they gave me the role of a spokesperson, it felt like I had a platform to talk about what I truly felt mattered.\\nThat is, until in early October last year, when I appeared on current affairs programme the Andrew Neil Show on behalf of the organisation.\\nI was fully briefed and confident, my mind whirling with rubber-stamped facts and figures \u2014 until he confronted me with one figure I couldn\u2019t defend. It was co-founder Roger Hallam\u2019s claim that unless climate change was halted, six billion people would die this century.\\nIt\u2019s a headline-grabbing assertion \u2014 but unfortunately, it\u2019s also not true, or certainly not backed up by any evidence. As was obvious to anyone who knows me \u2014 and even to the casual viewer \u2014 I was plunged into a PR nightmare.\\nI could not defend the number, but as the official spokesperson nor could I be seen to condemn it.\\nAll I could do, instead, was flounder under the hot glare of the studio lights for what felt like an eternity.\\nEven now, the memory of it makes me shiver.\\nIt proved to be the beginning of the end of my relationship with XR: whether it was hate mail from XR supporters accusing me of letting the organisation down, or more measured messages from colleagues saying we could \u2018get\u2019 scientists to back up Hallam\u2019s claim, it was clear that my world view and theirs were parting ways.\\nThen, less than two weeks later, XR members caused sizeable disorder at an East London Tube station, preventing commuters from getting to work.\\nThe ploy made me deeply uneasy \u2014 while XR\u2019s entire strategy is based on disruption, targeting London\u2019s public transport network at rush hour felt beyond the pale.\\nI made it plain that it shouldn\u2019t have been done, a sentiment that, in fairness, many other members came to acknowledge.\\nRunning parallel to this was my sense that like so many other environmental lobby groups before them, XR seem to have fallen into the trap of telling people what not to do, while also peddling the notion that the solution to the climate crisis was to \u2018turn back the clock\u2019 to a simpler time.\\nIt\u2019s something that has long infuriated me: try telling that to the people living in poverty in the Punjab. They want clean water, but they also want laptops. In short, they want what we here in the West have had for a long time \u2014 and it is rank hypocrisy for those of us who have benefited from the comfortable advances in technology in recent years to suggest they can\u2019t have it.\\nFor that, of course, you need energy. But while renewable energy can and should be part of the mix in supplying energy to the UK and the rest of the world, the reality is that there is only one reliable, low-carbon energy source that we can invest in now.\\nBarricade\\nIt\u2019s why, in June, I resigned from XR and took a new role overseeing British campaign group Environmental Progress UK, which is campaigning in particular for the creation of the mooted Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk.\\nIt\u2019s a decision that led to some abusive messages from a small cohort of my old colleagues, wedded to the ancient image of atom bombs and weapons instead of life-changing electricity and a dramatic reduction in carbon emissions. Yet the reality remains, if we are going to service our ever-burgeoning energy needs, then the only way forward is nuclear.\\nIt\u2019s one reason that instead of trying to barricade the gates of a newspaper plants or chaining myself to a barrier outside the Houses of Parliament I will be proudly holding a banner at my picnic this weekend, proclaiming something I believe to be true: Nuclear Saves Lives.", "image": [["Former Extinction Rebellion spokesperson Zion Lights appears on Good Morning Britain in October last year", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/10/00/32987536-0-image-m-45_1599695784320.jpg"], ["I was fully briefed and confident, my mind whirling with rubber-stamped facts and figures \u2014 until he confronted me with one figure I couldn\u2019t defend.

protection and recovery of rare and vulnerable wildlife, which would otherwise be threatened with extinction or serious decline.\\nMPAs also provide places for fish and other marine life to flourish, contributing to a more productive system both inside and outside of their boundaries.\\nThere are 91 zones in waters around England alone and hte first were designated in 2013 - known as the UK Blue

The cost of the oil spill keeps mounting.'\\nThe tugboat sank in deep water outside a coral reef and so far no oil has been seen on the coast, Dowarkasing said.\\nThe environmental disaster began on July 25 when the bulk carrier Wakashio strayed miles off course and struck a coral reef a mile offshore.\\nAfter being pounded by heavy surf for nearly two weeks, the ship's hull cracked and on Aug. 6 it began leaking fuel into the Mahebourg Lagoon, polluting a protected wetlands area and a small island that was a bird and wildlife sanctuary.\\nMore than 1,000 tons of fuel spilled into the coastal waters. About 3,000 tons remained on the boat and was pumped into barges before the Wakashio broke in two several days later.\\nThousands of civilian volunteers worked for days to try to minimize the damage, creating makeshift oil barriers by stuffing fabric tubes with sugar cane leaves and using empty plastic bottles to keep them afloat.\\nEnvironmental workers carefully ferried dozens of baby tortoises and rare plants to shore, plucking some trapped seabirds out of the goo.\\nDead dolphins began washing up on the coast last week. So far 47 dolphins and three whales have been found, Dowarkasing said.\\nAn initial autopsy by a government laboratory said oil was not the cause of the deaths, but few Mauritians believe that, Dowarkasing said.\\nThe government of Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth is under pressure to explain why immediate action was not taken when the ship first ran aground. He has blamed bad weather for the government\u00b4s apparent inaction.\\nTens of thousands of people marched in the capital on Saturday in protest, calling on top officials to step down.\\nThe ship's captain and first officer have been arrested and charged with 'endangering safe navigation,' and several investigations are underway.\\nThe Japanese-owned vessel's black box is being examined, and crew members are now facing questions about why the vessel, which had been heading from Singapore to Brazil, was so near to the shore.\\nA maritime official with knowledge of the incident, who asked not to be named, said last month the crew had been questioned about reports they were having a birthday party on board, but added it was not clear yet if the party had been held at the same time that the ship ran aground or earlier in the day.\\nThe captain, identified by police as Sunil Kumar Nandeshwar, 58, and his first officer were charged with endangering safe navigation and appeared at court in Port Louis, a police spokesperson said.\\nThe Mauritius coastguard had repeatedly tried to reach the ship to warn that its course was dangerous but had received no reply, the maritime official said.\\n'The route set five days before the crash was wrong and the boat navigation system should have signalled that to the crew and it seems the crew ignored it.\\n'The boat did also fail to send out an SOS (when it ran aground), and did not respond to attempts by the coastguard to get in touch,' the official said.\\nThe official confirmed that the crew had been questioned about reports they were having a birthday party, and\u00a0denied media reports that the ship had sailed close to land seeking a Wi-Fi signal, saying that looking for a phone signal would not have required sailing so close to land.\\nA national television network had reported that the captain told the court the ship was sailing coastline to get a phone signal, something he had done before when sailing through those waters.\\nHe was not in charge of the ship at the time, he said, the ship was not on autopilot and there was bad weather, according to the report.\\nScientists say the full impact of the spill is still unfolding but the damage could affect Mauritius and its tourism-dependent economy for decades. Removing the ship is likely to take months.\\nThe official noted it was the second accident in the area in four years and said the government might establish a signal station nearby to try to ward off future disasters.\\nMauritius National Crisis Committee said last month it planned to scuttle the ship's remains at sea at a yet to be determined date. It would do so in a way that would avoid further pollution or interfere with maritime routes, it said in a statement.\\nEnvironmental group Greenpeace said the action would lead to more pollution.", "image": [["Pictured:\u00a0Coastguards prepare for a search and rescue operation near the scene where a tugboat involved in cleaning up an oil spill from the MV Wakashio, a Japanese bulk carrier, collided with a barge during bad weather, in Poudre d'Or, east of Mauritius September 1", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/01/20/32658648-8686471-image-a-1_1598988318678.jpg"], ["Residents gather near the scene where a tugboat involved in cleaning up an oil spill off from MV Wakashio, which has become a national disaster for the island nation of Mauritius, a small island in the Indian ocean", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/01/20/32658644-8686471-image-a-2_1598988335344.jpg"], ["The environmental disaster began on July 25 when the bulk carrier Wakashio strayed miles off course and struck a coral reef a mile offshore (pictured on August 11 as fuel leaks from the ship)", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/01/20/32658634-8686471-image-m-4_1598988344239.jpg"], ["Pictured: A coastguard search and rescue helicopter hovering near the scene where a tugboat involved in cleaning up an oil spill off from MV Wakashio.

But events of the last week have exposed another emerging threat \u2013 the so-called eco-crusaders turned criminals.\\n'Attempting to thwart the media's right to publish without fear nor favour.

And I'm right behind you as you bring the full might of the law down upon that selfish minority. The very criminals who disrupt our free society must be stopped. And together we must all stand firm against the guerrilla tactics of Extinction Rebellion.\\n'And that means adapting to the threat that they pose and ensuring that justice is served.'\\nMs Patel said 'attacking people's jobs and livelihoods' is not 'peaceful protest'. She added: 'These are not peaceful tactics. These are tactics that are deployed to cause maximum damage to society, blocking of roads for example.\\n'Last week we saw ambulances and blue lights not even being able to get through to hospitals basically, you know threatening people's lives in addition to the economic wellbeing of our society at a time when actually we're trying to get society up and running all over again.'\\nMs Patel's comments come after the Government said powers to help police deal with disruptive protests are 'under constant review'.\\nHome Office minister Kit Malthouse accused some XR activists of seeking to 'impose an extremist world view' on others, claiming the 'worthy cause' of environmental campaigning is 'undermined by their tactics'.\\nOn Monday, he said he and Ms Patel are committed to ensuring the police have the 'powers required to deal with the disruption' caused by groups, such as XR, telling the Commons: 'I will keep the tools available to tackle this behaviour under constant review.'\\nHe also said the tactics used by XR protesters will be examined to ensure police have the tools needed to 'deal with' problems swiftly.\\nMeanwhile, the Independent newspaper columnist who masterminded the Extinction Rebellion blockade of printworks has claimed that the British media is worse than the Nazis.\\nMore than 100 protesters targeted Newsprinters printing works at Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, and Knowsley, near Liverpool, last Friday night, blocking newspapers from leaving the depots.\\nDonnachadh McCarthy, 61, has emerged as one of the leading figures in the group, and justified the attack on press freedom by saying: 'This is like World War Two and you guys [the newspapers] are on the other side. That is how we see it.\u00a0 It puts you on the side of the existential threat.\\n'It is a different existential threat but it is a bigger one than the Nazis.'\\nAs well as his role as a columnist for the Independent, he is a former deputy chairman of the Liberal Democrats and has appeared on the BBC.\\nMr McCarthy attended the protest at the printing plant in Broxbourne on Friday night, briefing journalists at the scene. In total, 77 people have been charged for the disruption at both printing sites.\\nFifty-one people have been charged after the demonstration in Hertfordshire, which began at around 10pm on Friday and ended at 11am on Saturday morning.\\nNatalie Brecht, 45, who gave no address was remanded in custody to appear before Hatfield Magistrates' Court today. 50 have been released on bail to appear at St Albans Magistrates' Court on November 27.\\nOn Friday, XR activists erected platforms made\u00a0from bamboo to block the road along with two vans, preventing police from clearing the site.\\nAlthough he was at the scene, Mr McCarthy insisted he had nothing to do with the paper blockade.\\nHowever, he outlined a proposal called 'the Great March for Truth and Blockade' last year, sending it to XR's so-called action circle.\\nIn it,\u00a0he identified the Broxbourne site as 'very vulnerable to a mass blockade'.\\nHis comments have been slammed, with\u00a0Tobias Ellwood, a former Army captain and chairman for the Defence select committee, telling the Times: 'It is a tasteless comparison to make. To even use such language shows their immaturity and shows they should not be taken seriously.\\n'If there are any sensible voices among Extinction Rebellion, they should be distancing themselves from such inflammatory language.'\\nCritics of the blockade have called it an attack on the free press after XR prevented hundreds of newspapers from being delivered.\\nThe Home Secretary has ordered a review of the law aimed at toughening sentences for the environmental extremists after they blockaded newspaper print works in a bid to stifle free speech.\\nOptions being considered include designating the group as an organised crime gang, which would leave militants open to the threat of up to five years in jail.\\nBy Zion Lights for the Daily Mail\\nLike many people, I'm planning a small gathering this weekend while government rules still allow, heading to a stretch of beach for a picnic.\\nMy choice of venue is arguably a little less orthodox, however: I'll be camping out on the precise stretch of shingle in Suffolk over which the Sizewell nuclear plant looms.\\nIt's not an obvious spot, especially for someone who has long prided herself on being a passionate and committed environmentalist and who until earlier this year was spokesperson for the direct action group Extinction Rebellion, or XR.\\nCertainly there are several people in that organisation who will be horrified by the very notion of going anywhere near Sizewell \u2014 but unlike me, many of them refuse to confront what I believe is an undeniable truth: that a pivot to nuclear power is the only thing that can truly rescue us from our burgeoning energy and climate crisis.\\nYet like so many lobby groups, my old colleagues peddle messages of doomsday gloom that alienate as much as they motivate, offering little in the way of positive solutions. It is scaremongering rather than inspiring, and while for a time I aligned myself with their world view \u2014 and their tactics \u2014 in recent months I have come to see things differently.\\nIn fact, after years as a member of one campaigning group or another, I now believe passionately that environmentalism \u2014 that umbrella term for the loose collection of organisations that have existed for decades trying to bring about an end to climate change \u2014 has failed.\\nBy that I mean that for all the picketing, and the direct action, and the exhortations to use less fuel, fly less and conserve water, nothing has really made a difference to how we choose to live. Day after day, we still hear of energy crises around the world, increasing drought and wildfires, and species facing extinction.\\nTurn the clock back 30 years, and I was hearing much the same messages in the classroom at my Birmingham comprehensive school. Some of the words and the numbers may have changed, but not much else.\\nIt certainly lit a fire in me: growing up in a working-class, inner-city area, the daughter of immigrants from the Punjab who worked punishing hours in factories to make ends meet, I was an unlikely budding environmental campaigner.\\nBut by the time I went to university I helped found a green organisation and later joined the Green Party.\\nFrom there I joined another small climate action group, but when it died out I stayed out of activism for a while to concentrate on my own freelance writing, taking a Masters in science communication because, unlike the slightly 'crazy hippy' connotations my unusual name may conjure, I've always been a firm believer in following the science.\\nIt's one reason I was first attracted to XR. Their mantra \u2014 initially anyway \u2014 was 'listen to the scientists'. So when they gave me the role of a spokesperson, it felt like I had a platform to talk about what I truly felt mattered.\\nThat is, until in early October last year, when I appeared on current affairs programme the Andrew Neil Show on behalf of the organisation.\\nI was fully briefed and confident, my mind whirling with rubber-stamped facts and figures \u2014 until he confronted me with one figure I couldn't defend. It was co-founder Roger Hallam's claim that unless climate change was halted, six billion people would die this century.\\nIt's a headline-grabbing assertion \u2014 but unfortunately, it's also not true, or certainly not backed up by any evidence. As was obvious to anyone who knows me \u2014 and even to the casual viewer \u2014 I was plunged into a PR nightmare.\\nI could not defend the number, but as the official spokesperson nor could I be seen to condemn it.\\nAll I could do, instead, was flounder under the hot glare of the studio lights for what felt like an eternity.\\nEven now, the memory of it makes me shiver.\\nIt proved to be the beginning of the end of my relationship with XR: whether it was hate mail from XR supporters accusing me of letting the organisation down, or more measured messages from colleagues saying we could 'get' scientists to back up Hallam's claim, it was clear that my world view and theirs were parting ways.\\nThen, less than two weeks later, XR members caused sizeable disorder at an East London Tube station, preventing commuters from getting to work.\\nThe ploy made me deeply uneasy \u2014 while XR's entire strategy is based on disruption, targeting London's public transport network at rush hour felt beyond the pale.\\nI made it plain that it shouldn't have been done, a sentiment that, in fairness, many other members came to acknowledge.\\nRunning parallel to this was my sense that like so many other environmental lobby groups before them, XR seem to have fallen into the trap of telling people what not to do, while also peddling the notion that the solution to the climate crisis was to 'turn back the clock' to a simpler time.\\nIt's something that has long infuriated me: try telling that to the people living in poverty in the Punjab. They want clean water, but they also want laptops. In short, they want what we here in the West have had for a long time \u2014 and it is rank hypocrisy for those of us who have benefited from the comfortable advances in technology in recent years to suggest they can't have it.\\nFor that, of course, you need energy. But while renewable energy can and should be part of the mix in supplying energy to the UK and the rest of the world, the reality is that there is only one reliable, low-carbon energy source that we can invest in now.\\nIt's why, in June, I resigned from XR and took a new role overseeing British campaign group Environmental Progress UK, which is campaigning in particular for the creation of the mooted Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk.\\nIt's a decision that led to some abusive messages from a small cohort of my old colleagues, wedded to the ancient image of atom bombs and weapons instead of life-changing electricity and a dramatic reduction in carbon emissions. Yet the reality remains, if we are going to service our ever-burgeoning energy needs, then the only way forward is nuclear.\\nIt's one reason that instead of trying to barricade the gates of a newspaper plants or chaining myself to a barrier outside the Houses of Parliament I will be proudly holding a banner at my picnic this weekend, proclaiming something I believe to be true: Nuclear Saves Lives.", "image": [["Police remove a topless protester after she locked herself to the railings of Parliament during a climate change protest",

There are lots of big businesses doing a lot to help the environment,' he said.\\nAndrew Bridgen, the MP for\u00a0North West Leicestershire, told the newspaper:\u00a0'XR is a trojan house for those who know they can never get power through the ballot box and claim to represent legitimate causes - environmentalism.\\n'But as is clear from their widely publicised ambitions of Socialism, Marxism, anarchy - it's very clear what their ultimate ambition is. Through their extreme actions and violent actions, they have actually damaged their causes.'\\nA spokesman for Extinction Rebellion today distanced the organisation from Hallam's remarks, adding:\u00a0'Extinction Rebellion is resolutely committed to nonviolence and to suggest otherwise is contrary to the evidence.\\n'These comments were made in an interview with a freelance journalist over a year ago and as we have previously said Roger Hallam no longer holds a formal role in Extinction Rebellion.

The stench of #DomesticTerrorism is strong!'\\nAnother tweeted: 'So if business owners all have bullets put through their heads, who is going to supply goods and create employment? Mind blowing numpties appear to run with the pack of 'extinction rebellion' supporters.'\\nIt comes as Extinction Rebellion\u00a0activists glued themselves to the ground to block entrances to Parliament today in a dramatic escalation of their two-week campaign of disruption.\\nProtesters said they 'jumped the barriers and ran past armed police to glue (themselves) on to the floor outside the House of Lords'.\\nThe tactic, a staple of previous XR demonstrations, was accompanied by scores of others staging a sit-in elsewhere around the perimeter of the parliamentary estate, including at the Carriage Gates.\\nA separate protest, carried out by XR ally Animal Rebellion, saw activists locked on top of a pink slaughterhouse truck parked sideways across nearby Victoria Street.\\nThe campaigners said they are demanding 'a plant-based food system as a means to mitigate the worst impacts of the climate crisis and reduce the risk of future pandemics'.

That such a heavy-handed demand was so wildly incompatible with freedom of expression, something they profess to cherish, seemed lost on the Extinction Rebellion (XR) activists yesterday.\\nBlockading access to national presses, thereby preventing newspaper distribution, was not exactly the most democratic of actions either. It was an irony that the ragtag army of mostly middle-class protesters who laid siege to presses at Broxbourne in Hertfordshire, Knowsley in Merseyside, and Motherwell in North Lanarkshire failed to grasp.\\nWhen they weren't chained to bamboo frames blocking the road, the protesters were delivering eye-crossingly monotonous diatribes to reporters. Typical of the activists was Gully Bujak, frogmarched from the Broxbourne blockade just off the M25 by police after sprawling on a blow-up mattress atop a van.\\nThe 27-year-old's previous battle honours include being arrested at a protest last April after sitting in a pink boat blocking the middle of Oxford Circus. On that occasion she said the police were 'polite and considerate' but that, she mused, was only because of her 'position of privilege as a white middle-class woman'.\\nTired and grumpy, the police seemed markedly less accommodating in the small hours of yesterday. A senior officer instructed his staff that two officers were required per arrest. 'This is a public nuisance offence and these protesters are preventing the distribution of four major national newspapers tomorrow,' he said.\\nAs she was led away, Ms Bujak, an 'actress, model and extra' gushed about her 'extraordinary' fellow protesters as if they were the cast members in a hit West End show.\\nThen she got serious and intoned: 'The climate emergency is an existential threat to humanity. Instead of publishing this on the front page every day as it deserves, much of our media ignores the issue and some actively sow seeds of climate denial.'\\nBy midnight in Broxbourne, around 30 Hertfordshire police officers had formed a cordon around 300 yards from where the 60 or so protesters had blocked the road.\\nA steady stream of confused workers turned up at the printworks, many having parked on the motorway verge because they couldn't access the car park. A frazzled manager stood at the cordon in heated conversation with officers. But as the night wore on, hundreds more officers arrived on the scene. By 1am, the quiet corner of Hertfordshire was a sea of blue lights and police officers from five different forces and more than 50 vehicles.\\nA handful of Extinction Rebellion loyalists stood outside the cordon filming the scene and co-ordinating with protesters blocking the road. At 2.30am, around 30 black-clad officers gathered in the nondescript business park, seemingly discussing tactics.\\nOne XR member filming the scene gestured towards the police and muttered: 'Here we go then' before they stopped filming and scarpered. Guests at the neighbouring Travelodge, clearly awoken by the ceaseless sirens, poked their heads out the windows.\\nFour black vans were let through the cordon and parked up as protesters began singing the Stars Wars film tune that is used to mark Darth Vader's entrance.\\nThey brandished dozens of black boxes containing drills and chainsaws which they then used to cut through the locks and chains the protesters had used. Enormous floodlights were used.\\nFor several hours, sparks flew and the sound of chainsaws could be heard against the backdrop of XR's music and chants of 'Extinction Rebellion'. By 5.30am, officers had arrested eight protesters \u2013 each arrest greeted with a cheer from other protesters.\\nThe group had sent out instructions for 'rebels' at home, which included going to local newsagents and 'explaining to potential newspaper buyers why their newspaper is not on the shelves'. XR's ambition to target printing plants was revealed by the Mail on Sunday in December. A plan called The Great March for Truth & Blockade, was pitched to XR's 'Action Circle' that month. The proposal identified the Broxbourne site as 'very vulnerable to a mass blockade'.\\nOne of the co-authors of the report, Donnachadh McCarthy, a career activist, was at yesterday's blockade. He said he was taking part because the Government was 'taking sides with the enemies of Britain', adding: 'We feel that there's silence from the media and Government on climate change. We've faced the Coronavirus crisis, but rather than use it to create a new, green, economy, the Government has given quantitative easing money and Covid loans to people like the aviation industry,' he said.\\nMr McCarthy, a green energy consultant, has been repeatedly arrested during protests in recent years. In 2014 he was part of the Occupy Democracy protest in Parliament Square and was arrested for allegedly refusing to provide his name and having a tarpaulin which could be used for sleeping, which he denied. Last year he was one of the more than 3,000 XR protesters arrested by the Met.\\nOther protesters at Broxbourne included Matthew Hammond, 51, a maths tutor, who once declared on an XR march in his home city: 'We pace the walls as if they were the walls of Jericho, to be broken asunder, to let the change and new world in.' He posted a long poem about his experience yesterday.\\nAnother activist, Tim Speers, was arrested last year while filming himself spray-painting the slogan 'animal emergency = crime against humanity' on London's Old Bailey.\\nCritical tweets on the action included one from Jeremy Clarkson, who said: 'Dear XR people. You've been hacked by a bunch of sixth form proto-communists. Lose them or lose ALL your support.'\\nMeanwhile Boris Johnson said a free press was 'vital' in holding the Government to account and 'it is completely unacceptable to seek to limit the public's access to news in this way'. Last night, police confirmed they had arrested 80 people across all three sites.\\nBy Holly Bancroft for the Mail on Sunday\\nWhen I went undercover as a new Extinction Rebellion recruit in April last year, I was confronted by a mass of wide-eyed, overwhelmingly middle-class idealists intent on forging a better world.\\nNow, with their tactic of 'locking-on' or glueing themselves to the ground irritatingly familiar to many weary city dwellers, their ranks have attracted a rag-tag group of seasoned activists eager to attach themselves to the XR cause.\\nAs their latest stunt to silence Friday night's newspaper presses \u2013 a vital engine of democracy \u2013 shows, their tactics have become even more sinister and risk ruining a previously peaceful campaign.\\nUnderlining the new threat, Rupert Read, an Extinction Rebellion leader, warned last week that 'parasitic' hard-Left groups were trying to piggyback on climate protests to further political causes.\\nThe academic said political groups, including the Socialist Workers Party and Young Communist League were seeking to further their own aims through XR. The organisation's new form of non-violent civil disobedience is one that has become so effective that even the Metropolitan Police have admitted it is beyond 'anything we have seen before'.\\nA lot of my time with XR was bizarre. I was encouraged to call alcohol 'suppression juice' while, during an exercise on getting arrested, one rebel was concerned about whether there would be vegan food in jail.\\nOver lockdown, while millions of school children were left without lessons, XR activists managed to set up an online academy to train members. It is clear that in the last 18 months, they have gone on an ideological journey and are beginning to splinter.\\nOne branch, XR Catalysers, is seeking to 'identify UK society's dominant power centres, obtain introductions to key 'influencers' within them, and nurture dialogue with them'.\\nThe group has always made much of its de-centralised structure, meaning anyone who wants to set up a local XR action group can do so \u2013 but this loose structure creates a problem when members go 'off message'. Co-founder Roger Hallam, 54, ran into trouble for comparing climate change to the Holocaust and recently suggested that MPs who he declares 'culpable' for climate change 'should have a bullet through their heads.'\\nHe founded a fringe group called Beyond Politics in June, believing 'immediate high-level direct action' is needed 'to bring down this genocidal Government.'\\nHe is currently on hunger strike in jail following his arrest last month for conspiring to cause criminal damage ahead of the current demonstrations.\\nDespite this, he is still a key member of XR's team who recently complained it had 'gone to the middle ground'.\\nTo rectify this, Hallam, a former organic farmer, proposed: 'We have to be super super radical in order to maximise the probability of maintaining a semi-organised society in the next 30 to 50 years.'\\nAs new recruits, we were asked early on how far we were willing to go for the movement and to identify ourselves as 'arrestable' or 'non-arrestable' \u2013 a key signifier of our dedication.\\nFor XR's co-founder Roger Hallam, those with 'skin in the game' \u2013 careers, families or other attachments \u2013 will never be free to offer the level of unwavering dedication to the cause that he desires.\\nAnd therein lies the problem. There are aspects of Extinction Rebellion's objectives that are laudable, but the troubling issue is the unswerving adherence of its hardcore activists. It is a case of full-blooded hysteria or nothing.\\nNot only will they not brook any discussion, they won't even listen to any diverging opinions.\\nByGlen Owenand Jake Ryan For The Mail On Sunday\\nHome Secretary Priti Patel ordered the police to guard newspaper printing plants last night to try to prevent a repeat of the disruption environmental activists caused on Friday night \u2013 and told officers to 'get stuck in'.\\nMs Patel, who described the climate change protests by the Extinction Rebellion (XR) group as an 'attack on democracy', told forces to provide a police presence at all of the printing sites.\\nIt came after XR delayed the distribution of hundreds of thousands of copies of national newspapers, including the Daily Mail, to shops yesterday by blocking access to printing presses at Broxbourne in Hertfordshire and Knowsley in Merseyside.\\nA Home Office source said: 'Priti was furious. She told the police to 'get stuck in' to stop a second night of disruption.'\\nOn Friday night, more than 100 protesters used vehicles and bamboo structures to block roads outside the works to highlight what they claimed was the media's failure to 'report on the climate and ecological emergency'. The presses print the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, the London Evening Standard, the Sun, Times, Sun on Sunday and Sunday Times, as well as the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph.\\nYesterday, Hertfordshire Police said 50 were arrested at the demonstration in Broxbourne while another 30 were arrested in Merseyside.\\nThe Metropolitan Police last night said it had handed out a total of \u00a3200,000 of fixed penalty fines to 20 Extinction Rebellion protesters for organising illegal gatherings of more than 30 people in breach of social distancing rules. Officers dished out the \u00a310,000 fines at a number of protests to organisers wearing pink tabards, including those arranging the procession of a 20ft model boat named after activist Greta Thunberg which was halted on the edge of London.\\nMs Patel said: 'This attack on all of the free press impacted many workers going about their jobs. Overnight print workers, delivery drivers, wholesale workers and retail newsagents have faced delays and financial penalty. This is a matter for the police and the Home Office.'\\nThe Federation of Independent Retailers said the protest left small businesses with 'angry customers' to deal with as well as affecting home delivery services.\\nStuart Reddish, the body's national president, said: 'It means we are unable to get newspapers to our elderly and vulnerable customers.\\n'Newsagents have played a critical role during Covid-19 in getting newspapers into the hands of readers and this is not helpful at a time when every sale counts.'\\nIndustry sources told the Guardian that other newspaper publishers swiftly helped pick up capacity on their presses to limit the disruption to distribution. Local newspapers printed at the Broxbourne site were also affected, including East Anglian titles produced by the publisher Archant.\\nUnder a banner reading 'Free the truth', XR tweeted that it was using the disruption to expose newspapers' 'failure to report on the climate and ecological emergency' adding: 'We're going to filter out the lies and take the power back for a night.'\\nAlanna Byrne, from XR, said: 'We will only tackle the climate and ecological emergency by breaking the traditional impasse of oppositional politics and coming together, despite our differences.'\\nThe Society of Editors executive director, Ian Murray, called the protest 'foolish and anti-democratic', adding: 'The irony of protesters who wish to have their voices heard and their message listened to attempting to silence others by preventing the distribution of newspapers would be laughable if it was not so serious.\\n'You have to wonder whether those planning and taking part in these foolish actions understand anything from history; that controlling or shutting down free speech and an independent media is the first action of totalitarian regimes and dictators.'\\nA source at Sun and Times publisher News UK defended the company's stance on climate, saying that Saturday's Sun carried an article by David Attenborough on how to tackle the climate crisis.\\nThe company was also moving to scrap all single-use plastic used to wrap its titles.\\nAlthough Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer failed to make a comment yesterday, Shadow International Trade Secretary Emily Thornberry said the protest was 'very worrying' amid concerns elderly people may miss out on newspaper deliveries.\\nOutside Buckingham Palace, other members of XR staged a two-hour 'danceathon' to encourage the Royal Family to intervene on climate issues.\\nLabour MP prompts outrage after praising 'excellent work' of Extinction Rebellion extremists who delayed distribution of national newspapers\\nBy James Heale for the Mail on Sunday\\nLabour MP Dawn Butler prompted outrage yesterday after praising the eco-rebels who blockaded newspaper printworks.\\nThe former frontbencher backed Extinction Rebellion on social media for its 'excellent work' after protesters blocked roads near the plants, halting deliveries of national newspapers.\\nShe added: 'Bravo #Extinction Rebellion' and accompanied the message with several clapping-hands emojis. The post was deleted just hours later. Ms Butler, who was sacked as Shadow Equalities Minister after Sir Keir Starmer's election as Labour leader in April, faced a furious backlash online for her comments.\\nGood Morning Britain host Piers Morgan branded Ms Butler's message 'shameful' and criticised 'a senior British politician [for] celebrating the stifling of free speech'. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel said the attack on a free press was 'completely unacceptable'.\\nYesterday, Labour frontbenchers were quick to distance themselves from Ms Butler.\\nShadow Secretary of State for Digital Culture, Media and Sport, Jo Stephens, said: 'People have the right to read the newspapers they want.

The idea that it is right to damage property or intervene with a free press in the name of progressive protest is, I think, perverse.\u2019\\nOptions include using the 2015 Serious Crime Act to designate the group as an organised crime gang \u2013 potentially leaving activists open to jail terms of up to five years.\\nMinisters are also looking at new powers under the Public Order Act to protect \u2018critical national infrastructure and tenets of democracy\u2019.\\nThis could make it illegal for protesters to blockade sites such as Parliament, the courts or newspaper printing plants.\\nExtinction Rebellion has caused widespread disruption to people and businesses in a string of direct action protests. A Government source said: \u2018The fact is that they do organise to commit crimes.\u2019\\nRichard Walton, former head of counter-terrorism at the Met, said the group was an extremist organisation whose methods needed to be \u2018confronted and challenged\u2019.\\nMr Walton, now a senior fellow at the Policy Exchange think-tank, said there was \u2018ample justification\u2019 for the police to use intrusive surveillance against the group.\\nExtinction Rebellion said it would be ridiculous to classify the group as an organised crime gang.\\nIn a statement last night, the group said: \u2018According to the Government\u2019s own strategy \u201corganised crime\u201d is \u201ccharacterised by violence or the threat of violence and by the use of bribery and corruption\u201d.\\nThat is hardly an accurate description of the thousands of ordinary people who take part in Extinction Rebellion\u2019s non-violent protests.\u2019\\nThe group claimed its targeting of print works was designed to force newspapers to give more coverage to climate change.\\nBut the action led to many Sun readers missing an interview with Sir David Attenborough on the subject. Academic studies suggest newspaper coverage of climate issues has been rising in recent years.\\nSTEPHEN GLOVER: How to beat the eco warrior bullies? Apply the law!\\nFor those who remember militant trade unionists laying siege to newspaper offices in the 1980s, the scenes outside printing plants in Hertfordshire and on Merseyside on Friday night and Saturday morning brought back bad memories.\\nOnly this time it wasn\u2019t trade unions stifling a free Press by blocking the distribution of newspapers. The culprits were Extinction Rebellion activists \u2013 usually middle-class types who are uninterested in debate and have no respect for democracy.\\nHow does society cope with such people? The extremists are not peaceful protesters making a point, as is their right. They are prepared to bring a great city such as London to a halt, causing inconvenience to hundreds of thousands of blameless individuals.\\nIndeed, although any attempt to suppress newspapers is chilling because it evokes communist or fascist regimes, interference in the lives of ordinary people is probably worse because of the sheer extent of the disturbance.\\nExtinction Rebellion (XR) succeeded in April 2019 and again last October in immobilising the nation\u2019s capital. Bridges and roads were blocked, public transport suspended. Other cities suffered similar upheavals, if on a smaller scale.\\nTogether the protests set back the Metropolitan Police at least \u00a337million. Contrast its annual budget of just \u00a315million for a violent crime taskforce operating in London.\\nThe financial burden of the disruption on businesses and shops, although impossible to calculate precisely, may have been even greater. One estimate is that just two days of malarkey cost companies in the West End \u00a312million, with footfall and spending down a quarter.\\nOther protest groups in the fairly recent past such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament or the women of Greenham Common seem reasonable, moderate and considerate compared to the often destructive Extinction Rebellion.\\nSo I think the Government is correct to view this organisation, which has apparently been infiltrated by several Far Left groups, as unusually ruthless and dangerous.\\nBut it doesn\u2019t follow that XR should be reclassified as an \u2018organised crime group\u2019, as is reportedly one option being contemplated by the Government. The thinking is this would enable the authorities to hand out much more severe sentences.\\nThe trouble is that Extinction Rebellion can\u2019t accurately be described as an organised crime group, which is defined by the Crown Prosecution Service as having \u2018at its purpose, or one of its purposes, the carrying on of criminal activities\u2019.\\nHowever obnoxious some of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s activists may be, and however ready they are to break the law, the organisation as a whole is plainly not engaged in a criminal conspiracy.\\nTo reclassify it in such terms would be to risk making martyrs of its misguided leaders. More seriously still, it might be seen to create a precedent that, when the Government disapproves of people exercising their right of free speech, they can be redesignated as criminals.\\nNo, let\u2019s not treat XR in that way. There is no need to. For there are already enough existing laws in the police\u2019s armoury, if only they had the gumption to apply them.\\nUnfortunately, on Friday night and Saturday morning the police were slow to act. At the printing plants in Hertfordshire and on Merseyside, they failed to start clearing Extinction Rebellion protesters for more than six hours. In the end, there were 80 arrests. Their relaxed attitude recalls the laid-back behaviour of the some of the police during the demonstrations in London last year. Absurdly, officers were filmed raving with protesters, while one policeman was spotted skateboarding on Waterloo Bridge.\\nHave ordinary police officers gone soft? Or is it just their timorous, politically correct bosses? There is a new tendency to try to make common cause with protesters, as evidenced by officers \u2018taking the knee\u2019 in Black Lives Matter demonstrations in June.\\nNo one could be a more enthusiastic believer than I am in the concept of policing by consent, but that does not comprise doing nothing when existing laws are clearly being broken.\\nIsn\u2019t obstructing the Queen\u2019s highway against the law? The 1980 Highways Act states that \u2018if a person, without lawful authority or excuse, in any way wilfully obstructs the free passage along a highway, he is guilty of an offence\u2019.\\nWhat about the law of aggravated trespass? Trespassing while at the same time intentionally obstructing, disrupting or intimidating others from carrying out \u2018lawful activities\u2019 is a criminal offence.\\nNot for the first time, Labour MP and former Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott was mistaken when she asserted yesterday that blockading newspaper\u00a0printing plants was a \u2018legal tactic\u2019.\\nIn an article in today\u2019s Mail, Home Secretary Priti Patel hints at new laws. There has been speculation that these could protect judges, MPs and even journalists going about their normal business. Well, conceivably, if it proves necessary.\\nBut we should beware of laws aimed at Extinction Rebellion \u2013 and certainly avoid treating it as a criminal organisation. Let\u2019s use existing legislation, which safeguards free speech on the one hand, and doesn\u2019t allow bullies to destroy livelihoods on the other.\\nAll we need then is a robust and sensible police force that is determined to enforce the law.", "image": [["Student activist\u00a0Katie Ritchie-Moulin was among the\u00a0ragtag \u2013 and rather middle-class \u2013 band of printworks rebels who attempted to blockade free speech by trying to halt several major national newspapers from going to print on Friday night", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/06/21/32850870-8703881-image-m-23_1599425231677.jpg"], ["Former Parliamentary candidate and Independent columnist Donnachadh McCarthy", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/06/22/32850878-8703881-image-a-41_1599426099159.jpg"], ["Student\u00a0Lydia Dibben with a bike D-lock around her neck at an XR protest", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/06/22/32850882-8703881-image-a-39_1599426079072.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/07/11/32850866-8703881-image-a-1_1599475464839.jpg"], ["Former Paratrooper\u00a0Robert Possnett calls himself a\u00a0\u2018literary snob and real ale lover\u2019", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/06/22/32850876-8703881-image-m-43_1599426124024.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/06/21/32850880-8703881-image-m-35_1599425937051.jpg"], ["Former\u00a0infantryman\u00a0Donald Bell", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/06/22/32850868-8703881-image-m-58_1599427453745.jpg"], ["Tech company director and father of four Richard Hallewell", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/07/03/32850874-8703881-Tech_company_director_and_father_of_four_Richard_Hallewell-a-22_1599444682673.jpg"], ["Extinction Rebellion environmental activist group (in the picture) maintain the blockade throughout the night using vehicles and bamboo lock-ons to try to prevent the Sun, Times, Telegraph and Mail newspapers from reaching newsstands on Saturday", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/06/22/32851128-8703881-Around_100_protesters_who_targeted_Newsprinters_printing_works_a-a-44_1599426457415.jpg"], ["Home Secretary Priti Patel has ordered a review of the law aimed at toughening sentences for the environmental extremists", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/06/21/32850406-8703879-image-m-13_1599424444511.jpg"], ["One of the protesters from the bamboo lock-ons is lead away by a police officer outside the Newsprinters printing works at Broxbourne, Hertfordshire", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/06/21/32851122-8703879-image-m-21_1599425738322.jpg"], ["Extinction Rebellion protestors block access of a printing house in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, leaving some newsagents' shelves empty on Saturday morning", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/07/03/32826964-8703881-Extinction_Rebellion_protestors_block_access_of_a_printing_house-a-23_1599444682685.jpg"], ["Police and fire services outside the Newsprinters printing works at Broxbourne, Hertfordshire", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/06/22/32843958-8703881-Police_and_fire_services_outside_the_Newsprinters_printing_works-a-46_1599426457685.jpg"], ["For those who remember militant trade unionists laying siege to newspaper offices in the 1980s, the scenes outside printing plants in Hertfordshire and on Merseyside on Friday night and Saturday morning brought back bad memories.

That is how we see it.\\n'It puts you on the side of the existential threat.

But she insisted expanding the airport would be 'pretty drastic too'.\\nThere was no one home yesterday at the family's \u00a3730,000 three-storey red brick house in the wealthy suburb of Moseley.

The idea that it is right to damage property or intervene with a free press in the name of progressive protest is, I think, perverse.'\\nOptions include using the 2015 Serious Crime Act to designate the group as an organised crime gang \u2013 potentially leaving activists open to jail terms of up to five years.\\nMinisters are also looking at new powers under the Public Order Act to protect 'critical national infrastructure and tenets of democracy'.\\nThis could make it illegal for protesters to blockade sites such as Parliament, the courts or newspaper printing plants.\\nExtinction Rebellion has caused widespread disruption to people and businesses in a string of direct action protests. A Government source said: 'The fact is that they do organise to commit crimes.'\\nRichard Walton, former head of counter-terrorism at the Met, said the group was an extremist organisation whose methods needed to be 'confronted and challenged'.\\nMr Walton, now a senior fellow at the Policy Exchange think-tank, said there was 'ample justification' for the police to use intrusive surveillance against the group.\\nExtinction Rebellion said it would be ridiculous to classify the group as an organised crime gang.\\nIn a statement last night, the group said: 'According to the Government's own strategy 'organised crime' is 'characterised by violence or the threat of violence and by the use of bribery and corruption'.\\nThat is hardly an accurate description of the thousands of ordinary people who take part in Extinction Rebellion's non-violent protests.'\\nThe group claimed its targeting of print works was designed to force newspapers to give more coverage to climate change.\\nBut the action led to many Sun readers missing an interview with Sir David Attenborough on the subject. Academic studies suggest newspaper coverage of climate issues has been rising in recent years.\\nSTEPHEN GLOVER: How to beat the eco warrior bullies? Apply the law!\\nFor those who remember militant trade unionists laying siege to newspaper offices in the 1980s, the scenes outside printing plants in Hertfordshire and on Merseyside on Friday night and Saturday morning brought back bad memories.\\nOnly this time it wasn't trade unions stifling a free Press by blocking the distribution of newspapers. The culprits were Extinction Rebellion activists \u2013 usually middle-class types who are uninterested in debate and have no respect for democracy.\\nHow does society cope with such people? The extremists are not peaceful protesters making a point, as is their right. They are prepared to bring a great city such as London to a halt, causing inconvenience to hundreds of thousands of blameless individuals.\\nIndeed, although any attempt to suppress newspapers is chilling because it evokes communist or fascist regimes, interference in the lives of ordinary people is probably worse because of the sheer extent of the disturbance.\\nExtinction Rebellion (XR) succeeded in April 2019 and again last October in immobilising the nation's capital. Bridges and roads were blocked, public transport suspended. Other cities suffered similar upheavals, if on a smaller scale.\\nTogether the protests set back the Metropolitan Police at least \u00a337million. Contrast its annual budget of just \u00a315million for a violent crime taskforce operating in London.\\nThe financial burden of the disruption on businesses and shops, although impossible to calculate precisely, may have been even greater. One estimate is that just two days of malarkey cost companies in the West End \u00a312million, with footfall and spending down a quarter.\\nOther protest groups in the fairly recent past such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament or the women of Greenham Common seem reasonable, moderate and considerate compared to the often destructive Extinction Rebellion.\\nSo I think the Government is correct to view this organisation, which has apparently been infiltrated by several Far Left groups, as unusually ruthless and dangerous.\\nBut it doesn't follow that XR should be reclassified as an 'organised crime group', as is reportedly one option being contemplated by the Government. The thinking is this would enable the authorities to hand out much more severe sentences.\\nThe trouble is that Extinction Rebellion can't accurately be described as an organised crime group, which is defined by the Crown Prosecution Service as having 'at its purpose, or one of its purposes, the carrying on of criminal activities'.\\nHowever obnoxious some of Extinction Rebellion's activists may be, and however ready they are to break the law, the organisation as a whole is plainly not engaged in a criminal conspiracy.\\nTo reclassify it in such terms would be to risk making martyrs of its misguided leaders. More seriously still, it might be seen to create a precedent that, when the Government disapproves of people exercising their right of free speech, they can be redesignated as criminals.\\nNo, let's not treat XR in that way. There is no need to. For there are already enough existing laws in the police's armoury, if only they had the gumption to apply them.\\nUnfortunately, on Friday night and Saturday morning the police were slow to act. At the printing plants in Hertfordshire and on Merseyside, they failed to start clearing Extinction Rebellion protesters for more than six hours. In the end, there were 80 arrests. Their relaxed attitude recalls the laid-back behaviour of the some of the police during the demonstrations in London last year. Absurdly, officers were filmed raving with protesters, while one policeman was spotted skateboarding on Waterloo Bridge.\\nHave ordinary police officers gone soft? Or is it just their timorous, politically correct bosses? There is a new tendency to try to make common cause with protesters, as evidenced by officers 'taking the knee' in Black Lives Matter demonstrations in June.\\nNo one could be a more enthusiastic believer than I am in the concept of policing by consent, but that does not comprise doing nothing when existing laws are clearly being broken.\\nIsn't obstructing the Queen's highway against the law? The 1980 Highways Act states that 'if a person, without lawful authority or excuse, in any way wilfully obstructs the free passage along a highway, he is guilty of an offence'.\\nWhat about the law of aggravated trespass? Trespassing while at the same time intentionally obstructing, disrupting or intimidating others from carrying out 'lawful activities' is a criminal offence.\\nNot for the first time, Labour MP and former Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott was mistaken when she asserted yesterday that blockading newspaper\u00a0printing plants was a 'legal tactic'.\\nIn an article in today's Mail, Home Secretary Priti Patel hints at new laws. There has been speculation that these could protect judges, MPs and even journalists going about their normal business. Well, conceivably, if it proves necessary.\\nBut we should beware of laws aimed at Extinction Rebellion \u2013 and certainly avoid treating it as a criminal organisation. Let's use existing legislation, which safeguards free speech on the one hand, and doesn't allow bullies to destroy livelihoods on the other.\\nAll we need then is a robust and sensible police force that is determined to enforce the law.", "image": [["Donnachadh McCarthy, 61,\u00a0attended the protest at the printing plant in Broxbourne on Friday night, briefing journalists at the scene", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/07/09/32867250-8705251-image-a-13_1599466950947.jpg"], ["Extinction Rebellion protestors block access of a printing house in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, leaving some newsagents' shelves empty on Saturday morning", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/06/01/32826964-8702157-image-m-73_1599352686153.jpg"], ["Student activist\u00a0Katie Ritchie-Moulin was among the\u00a0ragtag \u00bf and rather middle-class \u00bf band of printworks rebels who attempted to blockade free speech by trying to halt several major national newspapers from going to print on Friday night", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/06/21/32850870-8703881-image-m-23_1599425231677.jpg"], ["Former Parliamentary candidate and Independent columnist Donnachadh McCarthy", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/06/22/32850878-8703881-image-a-41_1599426099159.jpg"], ["Student\u00a0Lydia Dibben with a bike D-lock around her neck at an XR protest", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/06/22/32850882-8703881-image-a-39_1599426079072.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/06/21/32850866-8703881-image-m-33_1599425902780.jpg"], ["Former Paratrooper\u00a0Robert Possnett calls himself a\u00a0\u00bfliterary snob and real ale lover\u00bf", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/06/22/32850876-8703881-image-m-43_1599426124024.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/06/21/32850880-8703881-image-m-35_1599425937051.jpg"], ["Former\u00a0infantryman\u00a0Donald Bell", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/06/22/32850868-8703881-image-m-58_1599427453745.jpg"], ["Tech company director and father of four Richard Hallewell", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/07/03/32850874-8703881-Tech_company_director_and_father_of_four_Richard_Hallewell-a-22_1599444682673.jpg"], ["Around 100 protesters who targeted Newsprinters printing works at Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, and Knowsley, near Liverpool, in a bid to stifle free speech have been warned they could face jail time after a change to the law is mooted", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/06/22/32851128-8703881-Around_100_protesters_who_targeted_Newsprinters_printing_works_a-a-44_1599426457415.jpg"], ["Home Secretary Priti Patel has ordered a review of the law aimed at toughening sentences for the environmental extremists", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/06/21/32850406-8703879-image-m-13_1599424444511.jpg"], ["One of the protesters from the bamboo lock-ons is lead away by a police officer outside the Newsprinters printing works at Broxbourne, Hertfordshire", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/06/21/32851122-8703879-image-m-21_1599425738322.jpg"], ["Extinction Rebellion protestors block access of a printing house in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, leaving some newsagents' shelves empty on Saturday morning", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/07/03/32826964-8703881-Extinction_Rebellion_protestors_block_access_of_a_printing_house-a-23_1599444682685.jpg"], ["Police and fire services outside the Newsprinters printing works at Broxbourne, Hertfordshire", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/06/22/32843958-8703881-Police_and_fire_services_outside_the_Newsprinters_printing_works-a-46_1599426457685.jpg"], ["For those who remember militant trade unionists laying siege to newspaper offices in the 1980s, the scenes outside printing plants in Hertfordshire and on Merseyside on Friday night and Saturday morning brought back bad memories.

Home Secretary Priti Patel said that she was \u2018disgusted\u2019 by the attack on the Press.\\nYesterday policing minister Kit Malthouse told MPs: \u2018As a Government we will not stand by and allow the livelihoods of hard-working people to be undermined by a minority using the pretence of tackling climate change to impose an extremist world view.\u2019\\nHe said he and the Home Secretary would ensure police had the \u2018powers required to deal with the disruption\u2019.\\nMiss Bracht is the only person so far to have appeared in court. Those charged over the weekend\u2019s XR protests include:\\n1. Lizzie Haughton\\nShe grew up in novelist John Steinbeck\u2019s old cottage in Bruton, Somerset, and is now one of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s key organisers.\\nArrested at Knowsley, the 24-year-old Manchester University student is listed as a director of Climate Emergency Action, said to be the company that runs XR. In 2018, when Miss Haughton was an officer of Manchester students\u2019 union, she was arrested in the city for highway obstruction at a climate protest.\\nShe and nine others sat on a pedestrian crossing holding a banner which read: \u2018We\u2019re all f*****\u2019.\\n2. Patrick Thelwell\\nBeing arrested for the first time in London in 2018 on what the climate group billed as Rebellion Day was \u2018the single most rewarding and worthwhile experience of my life\u2019, according to Mr Thelwell, 21.\\nWorking as a gardener in between studying for a degree in politics and international relations at York University, Mr Thelwell \u2013 originally from the Wirral \u2013 was adopted as a Green Party candidate for May\u2019s local elections, postponed by the pandemic. He was among those charged with aggravated trespass over the Knowsley blockade.\\n3. Gabriella Ditton\\nThe illustrator, who attended Wymondham College in Norfolk where boarding fees are \u00a311,500 a year, says she has devoted herself to \u2018non-violent direct action\u2019. Miss Ditton, 26 \u2013 who posted an online photo of herself topless in an allotment to highlight another environmental cause \u2013 was among those arrested at Broxbourne.\\n4. Hazel Stenson\\nThe registered childminder and mother of one, 55, of Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, was pictured on an Extinction Rebellion rally in London with the group\u2019s hourglass symbol on her forehead. She has been charged with obstruction of the highway in Broxbourne.\\n5. Natalie Bracht\\nIn 2008, Miss Bracht was photographed in Islamic dress when she fled her home in Sunderland with five daughters over fears they were about to be taken into care. They were found in Munich waiting to board a bus heading for Turkey.\\nThen in 2014 she was reported to have disappeared again to go to Syria, before being imprisoned and asking to come home in 2018.\\nMiss Bracht said she had never even met the IS fighter and had never been to Syria.\\nSpeaking to the Mail after she was released on bail yesterday, she said: \u2018The mainstream media have made me a terrorist. I never had anything to do with it.\u2019\\nMiss Bracht has been charged with blocking the highway and obstructing a police officer at Broxbourne. She appeared at Luton Magistrates\u2019 Court via video link, but refused to enter a plea or confirm her name and smiled for most of the hearing.\\nShe only spoke to confirm her address, which she gave as a \u2018squat\u2019. District judge Sally Fudge recorded her silence as a not-guilty plea. Miss Bracht told the Mail she was not \u2018connected\u2019 to XR, but said: \u2018It looks like the people in this country need help to get their free speech again.\u2019\\n5. Joel & Miriam Instone\\nBrother and sister Joel and Miriam Instone were pictured enjoying a family holiday in Tuscany eight years ago, but today both are committed supporters of Extinction Rebellion.\\nAt his parents\u2019 home in Bury, Greater Manchester, Joel, 30, told the Mail yesterday: \u2018This is about a system that exploits working class people in our country.\u2019\\nHe and his sister, 22, have been charged with aggravated trespass in Knowsley.\\nWhat irony! \u2018Duped\u2019 ex-pr quit... to fight for nuclear\\nBy Guy Adams for the Daily Mail\\nOne of the great \u2018car-crash\u2019 TV interviews of our age occurred in Andrew Neil\u2019s BBC studio around lunchtime on October 9, last year. The victim was a 35-year-old mother of two from Exeter called Zion Lights.\\nShe was appearing in her role as \u2018chief spokesperson\u2019 for Extinction Rebellion, whose supporters were at the time doing their best to bring central London to a grinding halt.\\nWearing a chunky necklace and an expression that alternated between abject terror and bemusement, Miss Lights (whose first name is pronounced \u2018Zee-on\u2019) was asked to provide evidence to support the protest group\u2019s headline claim that climate change will kill \u2018billions of people... in the next ten to 20 years.\u2019\\nAfter umming and ah-ing for a few seconds, it emerged that no such evidence exists. There is, she somewhat sheepishly confessed, no prospect of global warming contributing to the death of \u2018billions\u2019, or even millions, of people in that timescale. The group\u2019s principal claim had, in other words, been made up.\\nMr Neil then asked his guest how Extinction Rebellion proposed to achieve its main target: reducing Britain\u2019s carbon emissions to \u2018net zero\u2019 by 2025.\\nOn paper, he pointed out, such a dramatic shift would require drastic measures including the confiscation of petrol cars, state rationing of meat, the complete end of all aviation, and the abolition of every gas stove and heating system in every home in Britain.\\nMiss Lights responded with a shrug. \u2018I mean,\u2019 she declared, \u2018I\u2019m not here to give you solutions!\u2019 It was, at best, an odd position to take, given the highly disruptive protests her group was at that moment conducting.\\nAnd things continued in this bizarre vein for ten minutes. As one newspaper critic later wrote: \u2018I have never seen such a laughable presentation by anybody. It would have been far more useful to have a defunct vacuum cleaner placed on the interviewee\u2019s chair.\u2019\\nLaughable is certainly one way to describe Extinction Rebellion, or at least their declaration that last weekend\u2019s neo-fascist blockade of newspaper print works was part of a campaign to \u2018free the truth\u2019.\\nWhere exactly, one might ask, was the group\u2019s commitment to the \u2018truth\u2019 when, as Mr Neil so elegantly exposed, it was endlessly circulating the false claim that climate change will kill billions of people \u2018in the next ten to 20 years\u2019?\\nThis flagrant hypocrisy \u2013 there really is no other way to describe it \u2013 is among the reasons why Zion Lights has, in the months since the interview aired, fallen quite spectacularly out of love with the lobby group she once spoke for, and is now working as a spin-doctor for the nuclear industry.\\nMore on this later. In the meantime, it should be stressed that Miss Lights had originally been part of the small cohort of Extinction Rebellion activists who at least try quite hard to practise what they preach.\\nUnlike many of the middle-class trustafarians who attend its protests, while simultaneously indulging in exotic holidays, she and her charity worker husband Aaron Cleland have decided to forego all driving and flying, and follow a strict vegan diet.\\nIn a 2015 book called The Ultimate Guide to Green Parenting, Miss Lights told how her daughters Arwyn and Raven (then aged four and two) wear second-hand clothes, play with \u2018upcycled\u2019 toys and books, and are required to wait for the paddling pool to fill with rain water before being allowed to splash around in it.\\nThe book, among other things, advised parents to \u2018take your placenta home and bury it in the garden, where it will decompose and provide nutrients for anything planted above it,\u2019 carry children in slings (rather than using pushchairs) until they\u2019re old enough to walk, and to \u2018make your own cleaning products\u2019 by using vinegar and baking soda.\\nMiss Lights, who is also a published poet, once told an interviewer how her girls eat (vegan) pancakes for breakfast, enjoy two hours of \u2018wild time\u2019 in nature every day and are educated at an outdoor \u2018forest school\u2019, as well as having \u2018free play\u2019 \u2013 unstructured playtime \u2013 at home.\\n\u2018They are permitted \u201cjunk\u201d food in the form of chips made from organic potatoes,\u2019 the interviewer noted, \u2018and, occasionally, a low-sugar, vegan ice cream with real chocolate chunks.\u2019\\nThis \u2013 just a touch joyless \u2013 existence, once saw her dubbed \u2018Britain\u2019s greenest mother\u2019 by the Telegraph.\\nIt also contributed to her meteoric rise within Extinction Rebellion, where she arrived as a spokesperson last July, and within two months was appointed editor of the in-house newspaper called the Hourglass, which she claimed was designed \u2018to appeal to more comfortable, middle-class people\u2019.\\nHer Asian heritage was also welcome, since it contributed to the diversity of an organisation whose leading protagonists are, like so many bien pensant Left-wingers, almost entirely white.\\nIndeed, days after her pummelling at the hands of Andrew Neil, she was namechecked approvingly in a lengthy article in the Guardian \u2013 where else? \u2013 which asked: \u2018Does Extinction Rebellion have a race problem?\u2019\\nBy then, however, Zion Lights was in the throes of a dramatic career volte face that would see her part company with the lobby group in spectacular fashion.\\nThe BBC interview had made her realise that Extinction Rebellion was \u2013 and still is \u2013 unable to offer any workable solutions to climate change, beyond replacing Parliament with \u2018citizens\u2019 assemblies\u2019, that will, somehow, come up with policies to stop all carbon emissions.\\nYet an existing solution, she came to believe, is staring us in the face. It is nuclear power, which she describes as a \u2018reliable, low-carbon energy source that we can invest in now\u2019.\\nMany on the Left, where Miss Lights has spent most of her political life, have of course campaigned vigorously against the nuclear industry for decades.\\nBut, shortly after her encounter with Andrew Neil, she met Michael Shellenberger, a US environmentalist who campaigns against so-called \u2018alarmism\u2019 and for workable solutions to the climate crisis, including the ramping up of nuclear power.\\nIn June, at the height of lockdown, she revealed that she had taken a job running Shellenberger\u2019s British campaign group Environmental Progress UK.\\nIn this capacity, she is now a vigorous lobbyist for the nuclear industry, pushing, for example, for the creation of the mooted Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk, which she says will produce 7 per cent of Britain\u2019s electricity, and save nine million tonnes of carbon emissions per year.\\n\u2018For many years I was sceptical of nuclear power,\u2019 Miss Lights announced. \u2018Surrounded by anti-nuclear activists, I had allowed fear of radiation, nuclear waste and weapons of mass destruction to creep into my subconscious... I realised I had been duped into anti-science sentiment all this time.\u2019\\nSince then, she\u2019s \u2018parted ways\u2019 with her old friends and become Extinction Rebellion\u2019s first double agent.\\n\u2018The facts didn\u2019t really change, but once I understood them, I did change my mind,\u2019 was how she put it.\\nPerhaps this weekend\u2019s efforts to censor the news media represents the protest group\u2019s way of making sure more of its free-thinking supporters don\u2019t also change their mind.", "image": [["She grins and waves her arms in the air as she is bailed", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/07/22/32891334-8707387-She_grins_and_waves_her_arms_in_the_air_as_she_is_bailed-m-45_1599514171232.jpg"], ["Lizzie Haughton grew up in novelist John Steinbeck's old cottage in Bruton, Somerset, and is now one of Extinction Rebellion's key organisers", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/07/22/32891330-8707387-image-m-29_1599513182461.jpg"], ["Patrick Thelwell was arrested for the first time in London in 2018 on what the climate group billed as Rebellion Day", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/07/22/32891344-8707387-image-m-27_1599513112198.jpg"], ["Illustrator Gabriella Ditton, who attended Wymondham College in Norfolk where boarding fees are \u00a311,500 a year, says she has devoted herself to \u00bfnon-violent direct action\u00bf", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/07/22/32891342-8707387-image-a-25_1599513080455.jpg"], ["Hazel Stenson, 55, a registered childminder and mother of one, was pictured on an Extinction Rebellion rally in London with the group's hourglass symbol on her forehead", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/07/22/32891340-8707387-image-m-31_1599513310908.jpg"], ["Brother and sister Joel and Miriam Instone\u00a0have been charged with aggravated trespass in Knowsley", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/07/22/32891332-8707387-image-m-42_1599513544712.jpg"], ["Mother-of-two Zion Lights, 35, from Exeter, was interviewed in role as 'chief spokesperson' for Extinction Rebellion in Andrew Neil's BBC studio around lunchtime on October 9 last year", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/07/22/32891456-8707387-image-a-43_1599513635605.jpg"]], "author": ["Glen Keogh", "James Tozer", "Richard Marsden", "Martin Beckford", "Sam Greenhill for the Daily Mail"], "date": "2020-09-07"}, "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8706543/Animal-rights-activists-linked-Extinction-Rebellion-blockade-Manchester-slaughterhouse.html": {"title": "Animal rights activists linked to Extinction Rebellion blockade Manchester slaughterhouse by attaching themselves to black coffins and climbing onto roof as six protesters are arrested", "subtitle": "Activists locked themselves onto coffins outside Tulip pig slaughterhouse.

She said ex-partners and her parents are supportive of her\u00a0child-free ambitions.", "text": "Most women engaged in a battle with fertility are desperately clutching at the chance to have a baby. My fight is probably better described as an un-fertility battle, as I\u2019ve spent the past seven years desperately trying to ensure I never have a baby.\\nI\u2019m 29 years old and, while many of my friends are married and starting families, or talking about the families they want in the future, I\u2019m still not in that place mentally. More to the point, I\u2019ve never been in that place and I\u2019m certain I never will be.\\nI have no wish to spend nine months watching my body morph out of shape. I don\u2019t want to be responsible for another life and, in all honesty, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be very good at it.\\nI\u2019m constantly told I\u2019ll change my mind, that my biological clock will \u2018kick in\u2019 soon or that I\u2019ll want kids when I \u2018meet the right man\u2019. But I know I won\u2019t. Not once in my entire adult life have I ever felt that longing for a baby \u2014 not even when I had a partner who already had a child. We were together for five years and his daughter was a lovely little girl, but I felt no maternal pangs.\\nYet, no matter how many times I\u2019ve pleaded with them, doctors won\u2019t countenance a permanent solution and let me have my tubes tied, even though it\u2019s my body and surely I should be able to make decisions about it.\\nAfter all, a man can request a vasectomy. What\u2019s so different about a woman asking for the equivalent?\\nI distinctly remember the first time I held a baby; I was around 18 years old and Mum and I had gone to meet my cousin\u2019s new arrival. Mum cooed over him. They insisted I held him too, and he was thrust into my lap.\\nIt was weird, uncomfortable and, in all honesty, I felt a little repulsed.\\nWhen my friends have babies I feel no pangs of envy or longing, and the thought of becoming an auntie to any future offspring of my older brother is more than enough for me.\\nThere\u2019s no deep, psychological reason for this. I was not a troubled child, nor did I have a challenging upbringing. Mum and Dad were excellent parents, supportive and loving, both brilliant role models. (Despite this, I don\u2019t really believe in marriage \u2014 though I could be swayed if it was a deal-breaker for someone I loved.) I believe I was simply made this way.\\nI\u2019ve always been honest and open about my child-free ambitions to my parents, who are as supportive as ever (if, perhaps, a little disappointed), and ex-partners have never taken issue with my stance.\\nMost of my friends have been unsurprised, too \u2014 except one who told me I was being \u2018irresponsible\u2019 in my pursuit of sterilisation. Though I\u2019d argue that an unwanted pregnancy is more so.\\nBut my desire never to reproduce doesn\u2019t just come from an ambivalence towards children. In recent years, I\u2019ve become more aware of the effect my lifestyle has on the environment. I\u2019m not an Extinction Rebellion \u2018Birth Strike\u2019 supporter, nor will I protest at your wanting or having children of your own. But I travel a lot \u2014 it\u2019s part of my job as a travel journalist \u2014 and that\u2019s not something I\u2019m willing to stop.\\nSo when I read that a 2017 study in Sweden showed that having one fewer child per family could save around 58.6 tonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions each year, it reinforced my decision to live child-free (I won\u2019t use the term \u2018childless\u2019 because my life isn\u2019t less as a result of not being a mother).\\nNow it\u2019s more than personal preference: it\u2019s a moral obligation. I\u2019m not judging parents for their choices, I simply want to make choices I\u2019m comfortable with.\\nBut it seems the world isn\u2019t comfortable with my decision.\\nI was 23 when I first mentioned sterilisation to my GP. I\u2019d been suffering ill effects from a Mirena IUD (a contraceptive intrauterine device), which threw my menstrual cycle painfully out of sync.\\nFor eight years I\u2019d been searching for the right contraception. I\u2019d taken and hated every pill and tried injections, which gave me a year-long period, while one terrifying broken condom meant I\u2019d never be comfortable relying on them again. I was very much at the end of my tether.\\nAfter removing the IUD, my doctor and I talked next steps.\\n\u2018There\u2019s another coil you can try,\u2019 she began, but I cut her off. \u2018Can\u2019t we just tie my tubes?\u2019 I asked.\\n\u2018No,\u2019 she said.\\nIt\u2019s not a procedure that\u2019s available to me. \u2018You\u2019re too young,\u2019 was her reasoning. I was livid. Apparently I can\u2019t be trusted to make such decisions for myself, yet a relative stranger can make assumptions about me \u2014 which is a travesty.\\nAged 16 we can choose to have sex. At 18 we can drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes, causing significant damage to our bodies. We can also choose to join the Army and learn to shoot guns that might eventually kill people.\\nShould I actually get pregnant, no matter my age, I can even choose to end the life of the child growing inside me. But even, at the age of 29, I can\u2019t choose never to bear children.\\nI\u2019m single now, but I will certainly have more long-term relationships in the future, and getting pregnant will remain a problem. So to me, the idea of never having to take another pill again, or have another IUD fitted, is bliss.\\nAnd, aside from unsavoury side-effects of the contraceptives I\u2019ve used, and the suspected links to diseases such as breast cancer, it\u2019s a waste of NHS resources to keep going like this. \u2018Female tubal clip sterilisation is difficult to reverse,\u2019 says The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. \u2018Research has found that regret is common, particularly if women are sterilised before the age of 30, if they are childless, or if there is conflict between a woman and her partner.\u2019\\nBut let\u2019s look at the facts: data suggests that post-sterilisation regret, as it\u2019s known, is actually unlikely.\\nIn a study of 3,672 women who were sterilised between 1985 and 1987, just 7 per cent wished they\u2019d never had it done. In a 1999 study of women who were child-free by choice, only one in 23 had regrets.\\nIn younger women, regret is more common, but research by American doctors, published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, suggests that still only a fifth of people sterilised under the age of 30 tend to have regrets.\\nI have seen several GPs at various practices across South London and all bar one have rejected my request. It\u2019s the same old story: \u2018You might change your mind.\u2019\\nOf course, it\u2019s possible that my feelings will change. But I am an adult human being, and living with the consequences of my actions is all part of life. I should be allowed to make these decisions about my own future without being patronised. The only person to entertain the idea was a kind, young, male GP in my last practice in Croydon. \u2018I don\u2019t see why not,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s your body.\u2019\\nFinally, I thought, someone gets it. I left elated. I even called my partner to share the good news.\\nBut the next week I was told the GP had moved on and I\u2019d have to see someone else. So I found myself back at square one. I\u2019m now stuck with a copper IUD inside me and agonising period pains.\\nTo an extent, I appreciate their concern. They\u2019ve got to be cautious around recommending such life-altering procedures. Although it can be reversed, it\u2019s a difficult process and there\u2019s no guarantee you will be fertile again.\\nBut the UK\u2019s General Medical Council says that doctors \u2018must work on the presumption that every adult has the capacity . . . to decide whether to consent to, or refuse, proposed medical intervention.\u2019 So I should be allowed a discussion at the very least.\\nFor most women, the keyhole procedure is simple \u2014 many are in and out within the same day. Under general anaesthetic, a small incision is made near the belly button, then rings or clips are applied to the fallopian tubes to stop the monthly egg from reaching the womb (instead it\u2019s just absorbed by the body). There are rarely complications and the surgery is 99 per cent successful.\\nOnce you\u2019ve had your first post-op period, you can go back to having sex.

But it is not acceptable for those who wish only their voices to be heard to attempt to silence others.\\n'The UK's media has provided an enormous amount of coverage on the issue of climate change, exploring the arguments from all angles. This attempt to blackmail the media into slavishly repeating the claims of one side of the debate while ignoring criticism of it will fail but displays a poor understanding of how the freedoms that allow organisations like Extinction Rebellion to protest are protected through the very free press they are attacking.'\\nJeremy Corbyn's brother, Piers, was also involved in a demonstration this weekend as he appeared in Sheffield to address a crowd of anti-lockdown protestors.\\nThis came only a week after he was fined \u00a310,000 for organising a rally in London.\\nIt comes after the Independent newspaper columnist who masterminded the Extinction Rebellion blockade of printworks has claimed that the British media is worse than the Nazis.\\nDonnachadh McCarthy, 61, has emerged as one of the leading figures in the group, and justified the attack on press freedom by saying: 'This is like World War Two and you guys [the newspapers] are on the other side.

The idea that it is right to damage property or intervene with a free press in the name of progressive protest is, I think, perverse.'\\nOptions include using the 2015 Serious Crime Act to designate the group as an organised crime gang \u2013 potentially leaving activists open to jail terms of up to five years.\\nMinisters are also looking at new powers under the Public Order Act to protect 'critical national infrastructure and tenets of democracy'.\\nThis could make it illegal for protesters to blockade sites such as Parliament, the courts or newspaper printing plants.\\nExtinction Rebellion has caused widespread disruption to people and businesses in a string of direct action protests. A Government source said: 'The fact is that they do organise to commit crimes.'\\nRichard Walton, former head of counter-terrorism at the Met, said the group was an extremist organisation whose methods needed to be 'confronted and challenged'.\\nMr Walton, now a senior fellow at the Policy Exchange think-tank, said there was 'ample justification' for the police to use intrusive surveillance against the group.\\nExtinction Rebellion said it would be ridiculous to classify the group as an organised crime gang.\\nIn a statement last night, the group said: 'According to the Government's own strategy 'organised crime' is 'characterised by violence or the threat of violence and by the use of bribery and corruption'.\\nThat is hardly an accurate description of the thousands of ordinary people who take part in Extinction Rebellion's non-violent protests.'\\nThe group claimed its targeting of print works was designed to force newspapers to give more coverage to climate change.\\nBut the action led to many Sun readers missing an interview with Sir David Attenborough on the subject. Academic studies suggest newspaper coverage of climate issues has been rising in recent years.\\nSTEPHEN GLOVER: How to beat the eco warrior bullies? Apply the law!\\nFor those who remember militant trade unionists laying siege to newspaper offices in the 1980s, the scenes outside printing plants in Hertfordshire and on Merseyside on Friday night and Saturday morning brought back bad memories.\\nOnly this time it wasn't trade unions stifling a free Press by blocking the distribution of newspapers. The culprits were Extinction Rebellion activists \u2013 usually middle-class types who are uninterested in debate and have no respect for democracy.\\nHow does society cope with such people? The extremists are not peaceful protesters making a point, as is their right. They are prepared to bring a great city such as London to a halt, causing inconvenience to hundreds of thousands of blameless individuals.\\nIndeed, although any attempt to suppress newspapers is chilling because it evokes communist or fascist regimes, interference in the lives of ordinary people is probably worse because of the sheer extent of the disturbance.\\nExtinction Rebellion (XR) succeeded in April 2019 and again last October in immobilising the nation's capital. Bridges and roads were blocked, public transport suspended. Other cities suffered similar upheavals, if on a smaller scale.\\nTogether the protests set back the Metropolitan Police at least \u00a337million. Contrast its annual budget of just \u00a315million for a violent crime taskforce operating in London.\\nThe financial burden of the disruption on businesses and shops, although impossible to calculate precisely, may have been even greater. One estimate is that just two days of malarkey cost companies in the West End \u00a312million, with footfall and spending down a quarter.\\nOther protest groups in the fairly recent past such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament or the women of Greenham Common seem reasonable, moderate and considerate compared to the often destructive Extinction Rebellion.\\nSo I think the Government is correct to view this organisation, which has apparently been infiltrated by several Far Left groups, as unusually ruthless and dangerous.\\nBut it doesn't follow that XR should be reclassified as an 'organised crime group', as is reportedly one option being contemplated by the Government. The thinking is this would enable the authorities to hand out much more severe sentences.\\nThe trouble is that Extinction Rebellion can't accurately be described as an organised crime group, which is defined by the Crown Prosecution Service as having 'at its purpose, or one of its purposes, the carrying on of criminal activities'.\\nHowever obnoxious some of Extinction Rebellion's activists may be, and however ready they are to break the law, the organisation as a whole is plainly not engaged in a criminal conspiracy.\\nTo reclassify it in such terms would be to risk making martyrs of its misguided leaders. More seriously still, it might be seen to create a precedent that, when the Government disapproves of people exercising their right of free speech, they can be redesignated as criminals.\\nNo, let's not treat XR in that way. There is no need to. For there are already enough existing laws in the police's armoury, if only they had the gumption to apply them.\\nUnfortunately, on Friday night and Saturday morning the police were slow to act. At the printing plants in Hertfordshire and on Merseyside, they failed to start clearing Extinction Rebellion protesters for more than six hours. In the end, there were 80 arrests. Their relaxed attitude recalls the laid-back behaviour of the some of the police during the demonstrations in London last year. Absurdly, officers were filmed raving with protesters, while one policeman was spotted skateboarding on Waterloo Bridge.\\nHave ordinary police officers gone soft? Or is it just their timorous, politically correct bosses? There is a new tendency to try to make common cause with protesters, as evidenced by officers 'taking the knee' in Black Lives Matter demonstrations in June.\\nNo one could be a more enthusiastic believer than I am in the concept of policing by consent, but that does not comprise doing nothing when existing laws are clearly being broken.\\nIsn't obstructing the Queen's highway against the law? The 1980 Highways Act states that 'if a person, without lawful authority or excuse, in any way wilfully obstructs the free passage along a highway, he is guilty of an offence'.\\nWhat about the law of aggravated trespass? Trespassing while at the same time intentionally obstructing, disrupting or intimidating others from carrying out 'lawful activities' is a criminal offence.\\nNot for the first time, Labour MP and former Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott was mistaken when she asserted yesterday that blockading newspaper\u00a0printing plants was a 'legal tactic'.\\nIn an article in today's Mail, Home Secretary Priti Patel hints at new laws. There has been speculation that these could protect judges, MPs and even journalists going about their normal business. Well, conceivably, if it proves necessary.\\nBut we should beware of laws aimed at Extinction Rebellion \u2013 and certainly avoid treating it as a criminal organisation. Let's use existing legislation, which safeguards free speech on the one hand, and doesn't allow bullies to destroy livelihoods on the other.\\nAll we need then is a robust and sensible police force that is determined to enforce the law.", "image": [["Natalie Bracht, 45, a\u00a0British 'Jihadi' bride who denies leading an all-female Islamic State unit in Syria, has been accused of\u00a0blockading the printworks of several national newspapers as part of an Extinction Rebellion protest on Friday", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/07/19/31740356-8706473-Natalie_Bracht_45_a_British_Jihadi_bride_who_denies_leading_an_a-m-15_1599502844742.jpg"], ["On arrival in the UK she was then questioned for more than three hours by Special Branch under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000.

The spokeswoman who quit Extinction Rebellion to fight for the NUCLEAR industry says: 'Once I understood the facts, I did change my mind'", "subtitle": ".", "text": "One of the great 'car-crash' TV interviews of our age occurred in Andrew Neil's BBC studio around lunchtime on October 9, last year.\\nThe victim was a 35-year-old mother of two from Exeter called Zion Lights.\\nShe was appearing in her role as 'chief spokesperson' for Extinction Rebellion, whose supporters were at the time doing their best to bring central London to a grinding halt.\\nWearing a chunky necklace and an expression that alternated between abject terror and bemusement, Miss Lights (whose first name is pronounced 'Zee-on') was asked to provide evidence to support the protest group's headline claim that climate change will kill 'billions of people... in the next ten to 20 years.'\\nAfter umming and ah-ing for a few seconds, it emerged that no such evidence exists.\\nThere is, she somewhat sheepishly confessed, no prospect of global warming contributing to the death of 'billions', or even millions, of people in that timescale.\\nThe group's principal claim had, in other words, been made up.\\nMr Neil then asked his guest how Extinction Rebellion proposed to achieve its main target: reducing Britain's carbon emissions to 'net zero' by 2025.\\nOn paper, he pointed out, such a dramatic shift would require drastic measures including the confiscation of petrol cars, state rationing of meat, the complete end of all aviation, and the abolition of every gas stove and heating system in every home in Britain.\\nMiss Lights responded with a shrug. 'I mean,' she declared, 'I'm not here to give you solutions!'\\nIt was, at best, an odd position to take, given the highly disruptive protests her group was at that moment conducting.\\nAnd things continued in this bizarre vein for ten minutes.\\nAs one newspaper critic later wrote: 'I have never seen such a laughable presentation by anybody.\\n'It would have been far more useful to have a defunct vacuum cleaner placed on the interviewee's chair.'\\nLaughable is certainly one way to describe Extinction Rebellion, or at least their declaration that last weekend's neo-fascist blockade of newspaper print works was part of a campaign to 'free the truth'.\\nWhere exactly, one might ask, was the group's commitment to the 'truth' when, as Mr Neil so elegantly exposed, it was endlessly circulating the false claim that climate change will kill billions of people 'in the next ten to 20 years'?\\nThis flagrant hypocrisy \u2013 there really is no other way to describe it \u2013 is among the reasons why Zion Lights has, in the months since the interview aired, fallen quite spectacularly out of love with the lobby group she once spoke for, and is now working as a spin-doctor who promotes nuclear power.\\nMore on this later.\\nIn the meantime, it should be stressed that Miss Lights had originally been part of the small cohort of Extinction Rebellion activists who at least try quite hard to practise what they preach.\\nUnlike many of the middle-class trustafarians who attend its protests, while simultaneously indulging in exotic holidays, she and her charity worker then-husband Aaron Cleland have decided to forego all driving and flying, and follow a strict vegan diet.\\nIn a 2015 book called The Ultimate Guide to Green Parenting, Miss Lights told how her daughters Arwyn and Raven (then aged four and two) wear second-hand clothes, play with 'upcycled' toys and books, and are required to wait for the paddling pool to fill with rain water before being allowed to splash around in it.\\nThe book, among other things, advised parents to 'take your placenta home and bury it in the garden, where it will decompose and provide nutrients for anything planted above it,' carry children in slings (rather than using pushchairs) until they're old enough to walk, and to 'make your own cleaning products' by using vinegar and baking soda.\\nMiss Lights, who is also a published poet, once told an interviewer how her girls eat (vegan) pancakes for breakfast, enjoy two hours of 'wild time' in nature every day and are educated at an outdoor 'forest school', as well as having 'free play' \u2013 unstructured playtime \u2013 at home.\\n'They are permitted 'junk' food in the form of chips made from organic potatoes,' the interviewer noted, 'and, occasionally, a low-sugar, vegan ice cream with real chocolate chunks.'\\nThis \u2013 just a touch joyless \u2013 existence, once saw her dubbed 'Britain's greenest mother' by the Telegraph.\\nIt also contributed to her meteoric rise within Extinction Rebellion, where she arrived as a spokesperson in April, and within two months was appointed editor of the in-house newspaper called the Hourglass, which she claimed was designed 'to appeal to more comfortable, middle-class people'.\\nHer Asian heritage was also welcome, since it contributed to the diversity of an organisation whose leading protagonists are, like so many bien pensant Left-wingers, almost entirely white.\\nIndeed, days after her pummelling at the hands of Andrew Neil, she was namechecked approvingly in a lengthy article in the Guardian \u2013 where else? \u2013 which asked: 'Does Extinction Rebellion have a race problem?'\\nBy then, however, Zion Lights was in the throes of a dramatic career volte face that would see her part company with the lobby group in spectacular fashion.\\nThe BBC interview had made her realise that Extinction Rebellion was \u2013 and still is \u2013 unable to offer any workable solutions to climate change, beyond replacing Parliament with 'citizens' assemblies', that will, somehow, come up with policies to stop all carbon emissions.\\nYet an existing solution, she came to believe, is staring us in the face. It is nuclear power, which she describes as a 'reliable, low-carbon energy source that we can invest in now'.\\nMany on the Left, where Miss Lights has spent most of her political life, have of course campaigned vigorously against the nuclear industry for decades.\\nBut, shortly after her encounter with Andrew Neil, she met Michael Shellenberger, a US environmentalist who campaigns against so-called 'alarmism' and for workable solutions to the climate crisis, including the ramping up of nuclear power.\\nIn June, at the height of lockdown, she revealed that she had taken a job running Shellenberger's British campaign group Environmental Progress UK.\\nIn this capacity she lobbies daily for the expansion of the nuclear power industry, pushing, for example, for the creation of the mooted Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk, which she says will produce 7 per cent of Britain's electricity, and save nine million tonnes of carbon emissions per year.\\n'For many years I was sceptical of nuclear power,' Miss Lights announced. 'Surrounded by anti-nuclear activists, I had allowed fear of radiation, nuclear waste and weapons of mass destruction to creep into my subconscious... I realised I had been duped into anti-science sentiment all this time.'\\nSince then, she's 'parted ways' with her old friends and become Extinction Rebellion's first double agent.\\n'The facts didn't really change, but once I understood them, I did change my mind,' was how she put it.\\nPerhaps this weekend's efforts to censor the news media represents the protest group's way of making sure more of its free-thinking supporters don't also change their mind.", "image": [["The victim was a 35-year-old mother of two from Exeter called Zion Lights (pictured) and she was appearing in her role as 'chief spokesperson' for Extinction Rebellion", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/07/22/32891616-8707401-image-m-52_1599513933911.jpg"], ["", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/08/00/32896088-0-image-a-4_1599522699204.jpg"], ["This \u00bf just a touch joyless \u00bf existence, once saw her dubbed 'Britain's greenest mother' by the Telegraph", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/08/00/32892070-8707401-This_just_a_touch_joyless_existence_once_saw_her_dubbed_Britain_-a-3_1599522650243.jpg"]], "author": ["Guy Adams for the Daily Mail"], "date": "2020-09-07"}}
