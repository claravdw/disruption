The government is likely to continue fighting for its proposals.\nThe bill is a huge piece of legislation that covers major proposed changes on crime and justice in England and Wales.\nThe most controversial part of it is on the planned changes to protests - which the government proposed in response to environmental activists who have blocked roads, glued themselves to trains and stopped printing presses in recent years.\nThe government was hoping to get the Lords to support its proposals, but in a series of votes lasting until the early hours of Tuesday morning, peers repeatedly voted against the government.\nMinisters were defeated, by 261 votes to 166, over plans to give the police new powers to stop protests in England and Wales if they are deemed to be too noisy and disruptive.\nAnd the Lords also backed, by 238 votes to 171, a Liberal Democrat amendment to strip out the power to impose conditions on protests on noise grounds.\nAsked if measures against noisy protests would be reintroduced in the Commons, Mr Raab told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We'll look very carefully at all of that, but, yes, absolutely.\n\"In relation to noise, of course we support the right of peaceful and rambunctious protest, but it cannot be allowed to interfere with the lives of the law-abiding majority.\"\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said it would \"reflect\" on the votes before the bill returned to the Commons.\nHe added: \"It is disappointing the Lords did not back the public order measures that will ensure the everyday lives of the overwhelming majority are not disrupted by a selfish minority of protesters whose actions endanger lives and cost the public millions of pounds.\"\nIt was a drubbing.\nThe government lost 14 votes in the House of Lords on the detail of the Police, Crime Sentencing and Courts Bill on Monday night, to add to the five previous defeats in earlier debates.\nMost of these are reversible in the Commons because they represent changes to the bill, but the government was also trying to add in some changes of its own, introducing a series of new public order offences aimed at preventing a recurrence of last year's Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion protests.\nBecause the Lords blocked these from becoming part of the bill, they won't be sent back to the Commons.\nLabour had approached this issue warily, conscious that they could be accused of allowing the rights of protesters to trump the rights of ordinary people to go about their lives, so they proposed what they regarded as a more focused alternative - but ended up helping vote down the government's new clauses as unacceptable on civil liberties grounds.\nMy best guess is that the government's proposals will resurface as a free standing public order bill, when the new Parliamentary year begins in April.\nOther amendments on subjects like misogyny, noise at demonstrations, drink-spiking, the Police duty of candour, the repeal of the Vagrancy Act and many more, will have to be agreed by MPs.\nThis is what's known as \"Parliamentary ping pong\", in which a bill bounces between the Commons and the Lords until both have agreed on its final form, and it can run on for quite a while.\nIt will have to be completed before the end of the current parliamentary session, expected in late March or April.\nPeers also voted against measures which would make it illegal for protesters to lock themselves to things and to give police officers powers to stop and search people in an attempt to prevent them taking part in illegal protests.\nGreen peer Baroness Jones described the government's plans as \"oppressive\" and \"plain nasty\".\n\"How do you seriously think a protest is going to happen without noise?\" she asked.\nLabour's Lord Hain called the move \"the biggest threat to the right to dissent and the right to protest in my lifetime\" adding that it would have \"throttled\" protests by the suffragettes.\nBut the government's Home Office minister in the Lords, Baroness Williams, defended the plans, telling peers that the police would only use the powers where \"necessary\" and \"appropriate\".\nShe urged peers to consider the different contexts in which a noisy protest could take place.\nThroughout the debate, drum noises from a demonstration outside Parliament against the bill could be heard in the Lords' chamber, but the minister said no-one would try to stop that.\nHowever, she said noisy anti-vaccination protests outside a school or nursing home were a different matter - and that police should have the powers to intervene if necessary.\nThe government also suffered a defeat over a separate issue when peers voted to make misogyny a hate crime in England and Wales - a move that would enable judges to impose stronger penalties if prejudice against women is proved to be the motivation.\nThe proposal was added to the bill as an amendment against the government's wishes and led by Conservative peer Baroness Newlove - a former victims' commissioner.\nBaroness Newlove said: \"As a society we have rightly taken steps to acknowledge the severity of racist or homophobic crimes, but have not yet acted on crimes driven by hatred of women.\"\nCrossbench peer Baroness Fox, the former Brexit Party MEP, argued against the proposal, saying the data collected would be \"almost entirely based on subjective perceptions\" of what constituted misogyny.\nShe warned that police resources would be wasted if they got \"tangled up in the reporting and monitoring of stats and data which I do not think is reliable\".\nHome Office Minister Baroness Williams pointed to a report by the Law Commission last year which concluded that making misogyny a hate crime would not solve the problem of hostility towards women.\nThe amendment had support from Labour and the Liberal Democrats and it was backed by 242 votes to 185.\nPeers voted against the government's plans to:\nPeers voted for new amendments to the bill that would:", "image": [{"caption": "A demonstration against the bill was held outside Parliament as peers debated the proposed law", "url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/59E7/production/_122751032_crime_bill_pa.jpg.webp", "local_name": "BBC_2022-01-18_Crime-bill:-Lords_img1.webp", "local_path": "article_images/BBC"}, {"caption": "Analysis box by Mark D'Arcy, parliamentary correspondent", "url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/13530/production/_120025197_markdarcy_tr_r4-nc.png.webp", "local_name": "BBC_2022-01-18_Crime-bill:-Lords_img2.webp", "local_path": "article_images/BBC"}], "author": null, "date": "2022-01-18", "source": "BBC", "id": "BBC_2022-01-18_Crime-bill:-Lords"}, "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-59996870": {"title": "Extinction Rebellion: Jury clears protesters who climbed on train roof", "subtitle": null, "text": "Two climate change activists who sat on the roof of a rush-hour train in east London have been cleared of obstructing a carriage on the railway.\nThe Rev Sue Parfitt, 79, and Fr Martin Newell, 54, climbed on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) carriage at Shadwell station on 17 October 2019.\nA third activist, Philip Kingston, 85, superglued his hand to the train.\nSpeaking outside Inner London Crown Court, Ms Parfitt said: \"It's wonderful that the jury saw the bigger picture\".\nMike Schwarz, solicitor at the law firm Hodge Jones and Allen which represented the defendants, described the verdict as being part of an \"escalating pattern\".\nHe said: \"There is mounting evidence from the courts and in particular from juries that the public is taking the climate crisis and the increasingly urgent need to focus on it far more seriously than government and business.\"\nThe verdict comes after four people were recently cleared of criminal damage over toppling the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol and throwing it in the harbour.\nSpeaking outside the court, Fr Newell was asked if he was planning to disrupt public transport again.

That is more than the aviation sector's pre-pandemic 915m tonnes.\nHowever, UK public body Agriculture & Horticulture Development Board counters that in the UK the dairy sector only accounts for 3% of total carbon emissions, compared with 7% for the country's aviation industry.\nPreviously, Ms Bowcutt was operations manager for the Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers for two years, before quitting to take up a job at perhaps the organisation's nemesis - The Vegan Society.\nShe went vegan after reading reports, such as this from Oxford University, saying that a vegan diet \"is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth\".\nThis study was widely reported, although others do say that going car-free or flying less have more of an impact.\nMs Bowcutt says she had also started to feel uncomfortable about the dairy industry and its practices after watching a session at a work conference about the optimum time to take calves away from their mothers.\n\"It all felt a bit unnecessary in terms of animal welfare and the environmental impact. It got to the point where I thought this isn't for me anymore, and I wondered if there was an equivalent organisation for vegans - and the job came up.\"\nMs Bowcutt, who lives in Leamington Spa, in Warwickshire, started at the Vegan Society last year. \"I have much more confidence about the work I'm involved in. I can see the benefits, it's easier to promote and a subject matter I really believe in.\"\nThe move to low-carbon jobs is urgently needed, argues Friends of the Earth climate campaigner Denis Fernando.\n\"There is a climate emergency, and we need drastic action to make things happen, so we'll [need to] see more of a push towards green workforces,\" he says. \"Green jobs create jobs. Everyone wins.\n\"There's a strong understanding towards moving towards green and low-carbon jobs, and an overall trend of people who want to do it, but we are deficient in terms of green skills.\n\"There's intention, but government policy could do more to quickly get more apprentices so they can start building skills. It can't be done to scale unless the government gives more resources to local councils.\"\nNew Economy is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.\nA government spokesperson says: \"The UK is capitalising on the green industrial revolution, with over 56,000 clean jobs created and supported in the UK's green industries since the launch of the prime minister's Ten Point Plan.\n\"These range from electric vehicle manufacturing in Sunderland, hydrogen facilities in Teesside, to new floating offshore wind farms and factories in Wales and Scotland.\n\"To build on this, we are ensuring people have the right skills for employment in Britain's new low carbon industries, through measures ranging from green skills boot camps, to dedicated apprenticeships, as we support new British industries, green jobs and economic growth.\"\nMr Fernando says green jobs have multiple benefits, including reducing the impact on the climate and restoring nature, and can involve millions of us.\n\"Green jobs could be anything from working on renewable wind turbines or ecology, but also bicycle repair, customer service at a railway station or a warehouse manager for a freight warehouse going by rail rather than air.\n\"We really need try to think of the big agenda which everyone can participate in.\"", "image": [{"caption": "Todd Smith, pictured here in his old pilot's uniform, is now a campaigner for Extinction Rebellion", "url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/15769/production/_122831978_thumbnail_image0.jpg.webp", "local_name": "BBC_2022-01-20_The-people-moving_img1.webp", "local_path": "article_images/BBC"}, {"caption": "It had previously been Mr Smith's long-held dream to become a pilot", "url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/70F1/production/_122831982_image0.jpg.webp", "local_name": "BBC_2022-01-20_The-people-moving_img2.webp", "local_path": "article_images/BBC"}, {"caption": "The UN has warned that the impact of climate change will mean more flooding, heatwaves and droughts", "url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/66AC/production/_122848262_gettyimages-1234015104-1.jpg.webp", "local_name": "BBC_2022-01-20_The-people-moving_img3.webp", "local_path": "article_images/BBC"}], "author": ["Suzanne Bearne"], "date": "2022-01-20", "source": "BBC", "id": "BBC_2022-01-20_The-people-moving"}}
