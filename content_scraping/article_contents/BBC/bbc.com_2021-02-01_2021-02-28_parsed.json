It's going to drive forward the West Cumbrian economy, creating a lot of opportunity for the people who live here.\n\"This is about fixing the problem [of local deprivation] permanently by putting people into good, sound, secure employment.\n\"Whether it's solar, wave, nuclear power, it's all going to need significant amounts of steel. At the moment, there's no economic way of making steel without coking coal.\n\"People have just got to open their eyes and take a balanced view on this,\" he told the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nWoodhouse Colliery, proposed by the firm West Cumbria Mining, has permission to operate until 2049.\nAfter the government announced it would not call in the project, the chairman of its Climate Change Committee, Lord Deben, wrote to planning minister Robert Jenrick warning the mine would \"commit the UK to emissions from coking coal, for which there may be no domestic use after 2035\".\nGroups such as Extinction Rebellion Cumbria and Keep Cumbrian Coal in the Hole have voiced opposition too, while South Lakes Lib Dem MP Tim Farron described the scheme as \"an almighty backwards step\" and \"a disaster for our children's future\".\nGreenpeace and environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg are among others to have expressed concerns.", "image": [{"caption": "It is claimed the mine will provide work for about 500 people in the Whitehaven area", "url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/FE73/production/_116793156_tv065432336.jpg.webp", "local_name": "BBC_2021-02-03_Whitehaven-coal-mine_img1.webp", "local_path": "article_images/BBC"}, {"caption": "The mine's coking coal could be used in wind turbines, like these near Whitehaven, the mayor says", "url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3F0B/production/_116793161_tv065432335.jpg.webp", "local_name": "BBC_2021-02-03_Whitehaven-coal-mine_img2.webp", "local_path": "article_images/BBC"}], "author": null, "date": "2021-02-03", "source": "BBC", "id": "BBC_2021-02-03_Whitehaven-coal-mine"}, "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-55891683": {"title": "Elbit: Activists stage protest at Oldham factory", "subtitle": null, "text": "Activists have obstructed the entrance of a factory in a protest against the arms trade.\nPalestine Action and Extinction Rebellion protesters chained the gates at the Elbit Ferranti factory in Oldham, as two others climbed a ledge.\nArmed with banners and red paint, they said they oppose \"an economy based on devastation, occupation and war\".\nA Greater Manchester Police spokesman said officers were at the scene and had \"engaged with\" the protesters.\nThe Israeli-owned factory, which produces weapons parts and surveillance equipment, has been asked to comment.\nThe activists also daubed red paint over the windows and sprayed the words \"Shut Elbit Down\".\nThe activists have vowed to escalate their action against Elbit until it is shut down for good.\nOne 37-year-old protester, who gave his name only as Paul, said: \"We are not here to be a nuisance but we are here to raise awareness.\"\nThe protest comes weeks after the Ministry of Defence confirmed Elbit had won a contract for new \"sensor to shoot\" system.\nThe \u00a3102m high-end surveillance system will allow British Army soldiers to detect and shoot enemy combatants in seconds.\nSpeaking after the deal was struck, defence procurement minister Jeremy Quin said: \"This contract with Elbit Systems UK not only delivers the very latest in battlefield technology to our frontline soldiers, but also invests in the British defence industry, sustaining more than 500 jobs across the UK.\"\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?
