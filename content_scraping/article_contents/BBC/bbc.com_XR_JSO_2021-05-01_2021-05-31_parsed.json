It's an approach employed across the board in all industries. Scientific uncertainty has always been twisted to prevent risk-based analysis.\\n\"Extinction Rebellion has always taken the view that the public deserve to know what credible scientists believe is the worst-case scenario for the development of the climate and ecological crisis over the coming decades.\"", "image": [["Zion Lights quit the environmental campaign group in June", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/F1D7/production/_114311916_zionlights.png.webp"], ["Extinction Rebellion protesters have been demonstrating outside Parliament this week", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/FDFD/production/_114312056_hi063243717.jpg.webp"]], "author": null, "date": "2020-09-10"}, "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-54038591": {"title": "Extinction Rebellion protesters block newspaper printing presses", "subtitle": null, "text": "Extinction Rebellion (XR) activists have delayed the distribution of several national newspapers after blocking access to three printing presses owned by Rupert Murdoch.\\nProtesters targeted Newsprinters presses at Broxbourne in Hertfordshire, Knowsley in Merseyside, and near Motherwell, North Lanarkshire.\\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the action by demonstrators across the country was \"unacceptable\".\\nEighty people have been arrested.\\nThe Sun tweeted to report copies of the paper would be delayed arriving at newsagents, adding the blockade was an \"attack on all the free press\".\\nThe presses print the Rupert Murdoch-owned News Corp titles including the Sun, the Times, the Sun on Sunday, the Sunday Times, and the Scottish Sun.

What led to this key moment in environmental protest?\\nIn summer 1999, Michael Uwins was summoned to London by Greenpeace. The reason was on a \"need to know\" basis.\\nThe group's East of England co-ordinator, he had been trained in non-violent \"direct action\" and knew something was about to happen.\\nWhat followed would make international headlines and result in a landmark legal verdict that gave a boost to environmental activism.\\nA trial crop of GM maize had been planted at Lyng, near Dereham, Norfolk, not far from Mr Uwins' home.\\nGreenpeace opposed such trials, claiming they would cause genetic pollution of the environment.\\n\"We were told we had to 'destroy that crop' - because it was about to flower,\" said Mr Uwins, now 74.\\n\"Before we made up our minds, we were given a percentage of the likelihood of arrest. It was 100%. That had never happened before.\"\\nSo, at 05:00 BST on 26 July 1999, the protesters, including a vicar and a beauty consultant, stormed the six-acre (2.4 hectare) field of modified fodder maize, trampling and pulling at the 7ft (2.1m) plants.\\nLeading them, in white overalls, was Greenpeace executive director Lord Peter Melchett, a former government minister and himself a Norfolk farmer.\\nThe activists destroyed a large section of the crop with a machine armed with whirling 4ft (1.2m) blades.\\nThey planned to bag it up and deliver it to Norfolk-based GM contractors AgrEvo.\\n\"We totally believed in what we were doing,\" Mr Uwins said.\\n\"We were not anti-science or GM as such; it was about open-air field trials. It was irresponsible and had to be stopped.\"\\nAccording to embedded Guardian journalist John Vidal, the activists were confronted by \"furious\" landowner William Brigham and family members.\\n\"They were ramming and chasing the protesters around the field - it was all very dangerous,\" Mr Uwins said.\\nMr Brigham declined to comment when contacted by the BBC this week.\\nThe police arrived and, one by one, the protesters were arrested and charged with criminal damage and theft.\\nMr Uwins recalls a \"surreal moment\" in custody. \"A station sergeant came round taking a fish supper order: who wanted cod, and so on.\"\\nThe activists argued they had lawful excuse for their actions, to prevent neighbouring land from being unlawfully invaded by genetically-modified pollen.\\n\"We did what we did to prevent a crime\", said Mr Uwins.\\nAt Norwich Crown Court they were found not guilty of theft in April 2000, but the jury could not decide on the criminal damage charge and was discharged.\\nA second trial began that autumn. It lasted two weeks, resulting in acquittal for all defendants on 20 September.\\nThey had been confident of victory, but were still relieved, said Mr Uwins, who remembers jurors hugging them outside court.\\n\"We felt triumphant. We felt we had achieved something and it was a message to the government that these field trials should not happen.\"\\nCo-defendant Nicole Sanderson, then 29, said the case forced the GM industry to \"sit up and take responsibility\".\\n\"When you take part in an environmental action - and I've taken part in hundreds - you are trying to stop something you believe to be wrong. You don't think about court and whether the 12 people of the jury agree with you,\" she said.\\n\"Sometimes you are bringing the issue into the public eye, to right a wrong before it happens.\\n\"The jury had to listen to some very complex science; it was a massive case. If they had misunderstood any of it at any point they could have ruled against us.\"\\nThe National Farmers' Union (NFU), however, described the acquittal as \"perverse\".\\n\"This gives the green light to wanton vandalism and trespass,\" it was reported as writing to then Home Secretary Jack Straw.\\nTwenty years on, the NFU said in a statement that \"crop genetic improvement has been part of agriculture for hundreds of years\" but that the European Union had been \"discouraging in its approach to new food technologies\".\\nIt added: \"Access to modern biotechnology would enable British farmers to use resources more efficiently, remain competitive in a global market and deliver even more high quality and nutritious food for the public.\"\\nAnother Norfolk farmer, David Hill, took part in a five-year cycle of GM crop trials, starting with sugar beet.\\n\"I'd seen the bad varieties of weed beet in the 1960s and this was an opportunity, in one fell swoop, to grow a greener and cleaner crop of sugar beet. The environmental benefits were immense,\" he said.\\n\"When I heard about the protest, I was bloody angry about it. We didn't fear them coming: we had very good security and we worked within official guidelines.\"\\nGreenpeace was delighted with the acquittal, but when contacted this week, declined to comment, saying it had not run campaigns on GM crops for several years.\\nHowever, Liz O'Neill, director of the GM Freeze campaign group, said: \"These protests took place amid a headlong rush to release GMOs (genetically modified organisms) without proper testing, monitoring or the labelling that gives consumers a choice about what they are eating.\\n\"They helped bring the issue to the attention of politicians, regulators and the media resulting in the safety-first approach that has protected our food and our farms ever since.\"\\nLord Melchett died in August 2018. In 2000, he appeared on Desert Island Discs, telling Sue Lawley: \"You only win a campaign if people support you and people will only support you if you're right - if what you're saying is correct or if what you predict turns out to be the case.\"\\nHis daughter Jessie Mond Wedd, 39, said he was \"a wonderful dad, committed to environmentalism\".\\nShe said: \"He had a very individual way of looking at the world; he loved the outdoors and wildlife and felt a real sense of fear that it was in jeopardy\"\\n\"I often wonder what he would make of it all now, seeing the Extinction Rebellion movement enter mainstream consciousness.\"\\nThe case inspired her to become a barrister, and she is now studying for a Masters in Environmental Law and Sustainable Development.\\nAs for Mr Uwins, he has \"absolutely no regrets\" and feels \"immensely proud\" of his actions.\\nHe now considers himself an \"armchair activist\", but said: \"If the same thing happened again I would get my walking stick out of the cupboard and head straight up there.\"\\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

From the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case of the 1930s, through to the assassination of JFK and the 9/11 bombings, history shows us that when there\u2019s a moment of societal tension, there\u2019s then a slew of conspiracy theories that seek to blame underground organisations, a global elite or certain religious groups. And where conspiracy theories have sprung up, cinema and TV have always been quick to follow.\\nOften the early period of the Cold War \u2013 a time of worldwide paranoia about seemingly pending nuclear annihilation \u2013 is cited as the golden age of conspiracy theorising, having given rise as it did to a whole range of suspicions about the \u2018other\u2019, from concerns that communists had infiltrated the Western establishment to the theory that the US government were covering up the existence of alien life. Such stories in turn spawned a series of TV and films from The Twilight Zone (1959-64) to The Manchurian Candidate (1962).\\nThen, in the 1970s, the fallout from the Watergate scandal (which ironically centred on a president, Richard Nixon, who himself fuelled a distrust of elites) caught the public imagination and led to a whole new wave of conspiracy thrillers about nefarious goings-on in the corridors of US government: \u00a0The Parallax View (1974), The Conversation (1974) Three Days of the Condor (1975) and of course, the great film about Watergate itself, All the President\u2019s Men (1976).\\nIn the 1990s and early Noughties, conspiracy theories were at the foundation of the drama in mainstream shows like The X Files or Lost, but they notably avoided very real and present dangers or atrocities still in the public memory, like 9/11. However in recent years we\u2019re seeing more and more prestige TV dramas, from Mr Robot to Black Mirror to Homecoming, whose plots use conspiracy theories to address very tangible and ever-present societal dangers, such as the role tech, government surveillance and Big Pharma have in our lives. In 2020, though, of course, none of these shows feels quite as easy to get swept up in as Utopia. Watching the show\u2019s lead gang deduce the very manmade genesis of a world-imperilling virus, some viewers may find their imagination getting the better of them \u2013 particularly given the continuing spread of unevidenced theories that coronavirus originated in a lab.\\nDr Michael Butter, professor of American literary and cultural history at Germany\u2019s University of T\u00fcbingen, claims one of the reasons conspiracy dramas are now so popular is that modern, expansive TV series suit complex conspiracy theories as, rather than having to whiz through plot, they offer audiences the scope to feel like they\u2019re discovering the drip-drip of information alongside the show\u2019s protagonists. \u201c[Long series] really go together well with the logic of conspiracy theory,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere everything is connected, where you always find another clue and make another connection. And this makes conspiracies so wonderful for show runners, because they can always add something. You can also turn around the plot after two or three seasons, [where] suddenly you\u2019re learning that everything that you thought was true was not really true, and you move in a vastly different direction.\u201d\\nA playful take on the genre\\nThe US remake of Utopia, written by Gone Girl author Gillian Flynn, changes elements of its British predecessor to make the series more relevant for a global audience \u2013 as, for example, the original \u00a0used a conspiracy theory to explain the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) outbreak that occurred in the UK in the 1980s and 1990s and led to 4.4m cattle being slaughtered and around 178 deaths.\\nWhat\u2019s more, while the UK version, penned by playwright Dennis Kelly, depicted an idiosyncratically broken Britain of decaying tower blocks, greasy spoon caf\u00e9s and bland motorway service stations, the remake inhabits a more familiar glossy US milieu of comic cons and tech firms led by charismatic CEOs, like John Cusack\u2019s Dr Kevin Christie, a Mark Zuckerberg-style leader who has brought a new meat substitute to the global market. It\u2019s a stylish and slick update that riffs on the original\u2019s offbeat colour palette which featured, for example, an England with continually blue skies (a result of post-production colourisation) but fails to successfully recreate its subtle characterisation (Adeel Akhtar\u2019s Wilson Wilson was one of UK TV\u2019s most memorable, non-stereotypical Asians) due to a larger cast.\\nTheir shared stylised ultra-violence, including a horrific eye-gouging torture scene aside, what both versions do well is capture a kaleidoscope of conspiracy theory belief among their main characters with Wilson Wilson, now played by Desmin Borges, being the most militant believer compared to everyman sceptic and fellow comic book nerd, Ian, who is at the opposite end of the scale. This range of beliefs enables Utopia to appeal to everyone from ardent conspiracy theory lovers to conspiracy theory cynics alike.\\n\u201cUtopia has the trope of people playfully engaging with conspiracy and conspiracy theory,\u201d says Butter, pointing to the way in which the genesis of its main conspiracy theory in a comic book offers a meta-wink at how popular culture both fuels and hinders conspiracy theorists. \u201cIt [reflects] this idea that conspiracy theories are still popular and attractive, and at the same time they\u2019re stigmatised... as something for entertainment, for board games, for comic books or whatever.\u201d\\nThe steady stream of conspiracy-based entertainment that has appeared recently (including documentaries such as Netflix\u2019s A Perfect Crime, about the 1991 assassination of German politician Detlev Karsten Rohwedder, which is also released today) might also owe a lot to the fact that we live in a world so keen on conspiracy narratives \u2013 such that they \u00a0have even been popularised and endorsed by the most powerful man in the world. Although Trump is not the first US president to be intrigued by conspiracy theories, he is perhaps unparalleled\u00a0 in using them so overtly for political ends, Butter argues, such as the Obama \u2018birther\u2019 conspiracy theory that is now being echoed in his amplification of a similar theory about Kamala Harris. This might even explain why he himself is now at the centre of one.\\n\u201cTrump is really, really good at playing conspiracy theories,\u201d Butter says. \u201cHe uses them as a safety net for himself. He is very good at not really being pinned down to them. He is always introducing them saying, \u2018I hear a lot\u2019, \u2018people tell me all the time\u2019, \u2018a lot of people are saying that\u2019. This makes sure that conspiracy theories are constantly reported, are constantly in the public sphere and this in turn [may fuel] cultural representations.\u201d\\nThe lure of the conspiracy\\n\u201cPopulism has a way of really simplifying the world,\u201d he adds, \u201cand simplifying social conflict and then providing very simple answers that usually don\u2019t work. And we know from a lot of studies that there is a lot of overlap between people who are drawn to populist politicians and movements with people who believe in conspiracy theories.\u201d \u00a0It\u2019s an irony that where conspiracy theories once took aim at society\u2019s most powerful institutions, they are now being harnessed by the powerful, as a way to engage with disillusioned voters, who may have felt previously ignored by mainstream politics.\\nJohn Grohol, psychologist and founder of the Psych Central website, sees conspiracy theories as a way that some can make sense of major events without challenging their worldview. \u201cI believe that not only do they give a little bit of order, they try and make sense of something that doesn\u2019t seem to make any sense,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, for instance, it doesn\u2019t seem to make any sense that terrorists would fly airplanes into very tall buildings. Before 9/11 happened, that just never occurred. And so for people to wrap their heads around that kind of event, conspiracy theories arose to help make sense of that tragedy.\\n\u201cResearchers have found that people who are more fearful and anxious have lower perceived feelings of control over situations,\u201d he adds. \u201cSo people with those kinds of traits tend to believe in conspiracies more.\u201d\\nIn fiction, equally, conspiracy theory dramas exploit events and issues that we fear the most \u2013 and so it was that climate change, population control and unregulated science were at the top of the news agenda when Kelly first conceived Utopia. Now, with Extinction Rebellion protesting daily and causing headlines, some might say it is a fitting moment for Utopia\u2019s take on climate change radicalism, which sees dogmatic ideology cause human suffering.\\nOthers might argue that Utopia exemplifies the problem with conspiracy theory dramas: that they can promote the kind of unfounded crankdom that says, for example, that climate change activists are the real problem not climate change itself, \u00a0even when it is the latter in reality that is devastating the planet and causing widespread deaths. But most viewers can watch Utopia without suddenly believing its outlandish plots and doing this might even be part of its allure.\\n\u201cShows like Utopia appeal to people who watch them ironically,\u201d Butter says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think that this tells [those types of viewers] anything about how the world really works. And of course they also appeal to people who still believe that conspiracies exist all the time and that they might actually be on to something.\u201d\\nWhatever the audience response to Utopia, its producers must be hoping its on-the-nose subject matter proves a potent draw in 2020. For some, it might be a bit too close to home: but for others, its far-fetched pandemic conspiracies might just provide some perverse comfort, given how our real-life pandemic still awaits so much explanation.\\nUtopia is available now on Amazon Prime\\nLove film and TV?

If everything goes well, the public won't notice how commanders and demo organisers have worked out how to make an event safe.\\nBut when it goes wrong, then the inevitable accusations of failure come piling in.\\nSunday dawned badly for the Metropolitan Police's commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick. Her officers were accused of oppressing women and politicians waded in calling for her head.\\nBut the seeds for Saturday's PR disaster for the force were sown in the legal dispute over whether a vigil could take place at all - and how events then seemed to run out of control.\\nThe question is whether the police should have foreseen that happening. That, time and again, is the great challenge of public order policing.\\nEarlier in the week it became increasingly clear that people up and down the UK wanted to hold vigils for Sarah Everard.\\nWomen in London, organising under the Reclaim These Streets banner, approached Met commanders for their help in setting up a vigil on Clapham Common in south London, close to where Ms Everard was last seen alive.\\nThe police said a demo would be illegal under the coronavirus lockdown regulations.\\nAnd so the women and their lawyers asked the High Court to make a declaration that would force the police to think again.\\nThe problem is that the law is not that clear cut.\\nFor almost a year, the ambiguities and omissions within the coronavirus restrictions have left both the police and the public grasping for answers as to what is possible in public. It's so complex we've even seen people fined for walking while holding a cup of tea.\\nGatherings in public are generally banned in England but, at the same time, the rules recognise there are \"reasonable excuses\" to be outside.\\nBut the law doesn't specify whether a demonstration on a major issue of public importance - such as this vigil - is one of those excuses.\\nNo matter what the Covid regulations say, there is an overarching right to freedom of expression that is enshrined in the Human Rights Act. That means the police have a legal duty to help make safe protests possible.\\nBut that right is not an absolute trump card - it can be interfered with if the police can show they have good reason to stop an event happening.\\nAnd after hours of difficult legal argument on Friday, the judge refused to intervene and basically told the two sides to work it out for themselves with all those legal principles in mind.\\nIn the absence of further legal clarity, the organisers claimed victory. They said the police had to now negotiate a sensible well-run vigil.\\nThen, the police pushed back hard. They said they too had been vindicated. They could not authorise a potentially unlimited demonstration that would become an enormous Covid-spreading event. Stay at home, they said.\\nBy Saturday morning, the organisers abandoned their plans amid a very serious risk they could each face a \u00a310,000 fine for organising a lockdown-breaking gathering.\\nBut by that point, it was inevitable that people would turn up at Clapham Common, whether or not there was going to be a public event. It was the talk of social media.\\nSo given that racing certainty, and the lack of official marshals that Reclaim These Streets said they would have provided had the police agreed to a vigil, what was the police's plan to keep people safe?\\nThe turning point in Scotland Yard's tactics appears to have been the start of speeches from the bandstand, around 18:00 GMT. People pressed forwards to hear.\\nAssistant Commissioner Helen Ball said: \"At this point, officers on the ground were faced with a very difficult decision.\\n\"Hundreds of people were packed tightly together, posing a very real risk of easily transmitting Covid-19.\"\\nAnd so, they tried to break up that part of the gathering and remove people whom they believed were contributing to the crowding.\\nPatsy Stevenson, the red-haired woman caught on camera being handcuffed on the ground at the bandstand, received a \u00a3200 Covid fine as police tried to remove her from the area.\\nShe has not been accused of, or charged with, violence - but was there any elsewhere?\\nThere was definitely a lot of anger - with some of the crowd chanting obscenities at the police at one point.\\nThe Metropolitan Police Federation, representing frontline officers, says 26 of them were assaulted yesterday at Clapham - punched, kicked and spat at.\\nPictures obtained by the Press Association clearly show three instances of officers being forcibly pushed and a van's wing mirror being deliberately vandalised. Guess what? All three instances involved men, not women.\\nAssistant Commissioner Helen Ball has said the Met did not want to be in the position where it had to turn to enforcement. But what's not clear is why this demonstration was considered to be so much more of a Covid risk than others that commanders couldn't find a way to make it possible.\\nPolice forces elsewhere in the UK were waiting for a lead from the Met. But those that saw DIY vigils - albeit far smaller ones - appeared to take a stand-back approach.\\nThe better comparison is Black Lives Matter last summer, when there were large crowds in London and elsewhere that were clearly not socially distancing.\\nWhy the difference? That, and other questions about how the operation unfolded, may have been answered in the report that's been sent to Home Secretary Priti Patel.\\nShe's now asked Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to carry out its own external review of the event - and what Ms Patel ultimately concludes may dictate whether Dame Cressida survives calls for her to go.\\nWhile the commissioner is accountable to the Mayor of London, who has raised his own serious concerns after a meeting with Dame Cressida, the Home Secretary is jointly responsible for deciding who gets the job - and when they should go.\\nDame Cressida is highly respected both in policing and government - far more so than some of her predecessors - but she remains a controversial figure for many others.\\nShe commanded the 2005 operation that led to the shooting dead of Jean Charles De Menezes, after he was mistaken for a suicide bomber - although a jury exonerated her of any personal wrongdoing.\\nMore recently, she called for better powers to deal with Extinction Rebellion's repeated occupations of parts of London. The government agreed - and the home secretary's proposals to greatly expand the police's ability to curtail demonstrations goes before Parliament on Monday.\\nAsk most police officers who have experience of covering public protests, and they will tell you they often feel - individual mistakes besides - it is a no-win situation when things go wrong.
