The company has cleared nearly 60,000 hectares of forests inside its government-granted concessions - an area the size of Chicago or Seoul.\nA 2018 report by the FSC into the allegations against Korindo was never published, after legal threats from the company, but the BBC obtained a copy.\nThe report found \"evidence beyond reasonable doubt\" that Korindo's palm oil operation destroyed 30,000 hectares of high conservation forest in breach of FSC regulations and that the company was, \"on the balance of probability \u2026 supporting the violation of traditional and human rights for its own benefit.\"\nA visual investigation by the Forensic Architecture group at Goldsmiths University in London and Greenpeace International, published in conjunction with the BBC, also found evidence that indicated deliberate burning.\nKiki Taufik, head of the Greenpeace Southeast Asia forest campaign said the FSC decision was \"better late than never\" saying they had \"finally come to their senses\".\nBut he said the Indonesian government continues to \"grant companies like Korindo forest concessions, allowing them to violate the rights of indigenous people.\"\n\"It is crucial that buyers and certification bodies don't keep helping them create a facade of sustainability and transparency,\" he said.\nAfter the BBC's investigation last year, the Indonesian parliament had launched an inquiry into Korindo's conduct - though the findings have not been made public.\nThe Korindo group strongly denies starting any fires or involvement in any human rights violations, saying it follows the law.  They also insisted they paid fair compensation to tribes.\nIndonesia is the world's largest exporter of palm oil -  found in everything from shampoo to biscuits - and Papua is its newest frontier.\nThe rich forests in the remote province of Papua had until recently escaped relatively untouched, but the government has rapidly opened the area up to investors, vowing to bring prosperity to one of the poorest regions in the country.\nVast areas of forest have been cleared to make way for row upon row of oil palm trees.\nIndonesia's palm oil exports were worth about $19bn (\u00a314bn) last year, according to data from Gapki, the nation's palm oil association.", "image": [{"caption": "Environmental activists fear for the Papua rainforest - among the most biodiverse places in the world", "url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/F02B/production/_115338416_ee562667-362a-49b3-98b8-73f11f600656.jpg.webp", "local_name": "BBC_2021-07-15_Korindo:-Korean-palm_img1.webp", "local_path": "article_images/BBC"}], "author": null, "date": "2021-07-15", "source": "BBC", "id": "BBC_2021-07-15_Korindo:-Korean-palm"}, "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-57864459": {"title": "Extinction Rebellion protesters guilty of obstructing highway", "subtitle": null, "text": "Six more Extinction Rebellion protesters who blockaded a newspaper printing works have been found guilty of obstructing the highway.\nThe blockade in September was at Newsprinters, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News UK, in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire.\nIt stopped three-and-half-million national newspapers from being distributed across the country.\nFive of those convicted at St Albans Magistrates' Court received conditional discharges, while the other was fined.\nIt was the second trial following the protest after the Crown Prosecution Service chose to try six defendants at a time.\nAbout 50 protesters put up tall bamboo structures outside the gates to the plant where the Sun, the Times, the Daily Mail, the Daily Telegraph and London Evening Standard were printed.\nThe trial heard Home Secretary Priti Patel had made multiple calls to commanding police officers about the protest and requested to \"expedite\" their removal.\nThe court also heard text messages to officers from Ms Patel were deleted in an IT \"glitch\".\nRaj Chada, defending, said an independent review, commissioned by Hertfordshire Police, found officers had been placed under \"significant political pressure\".\nHowever, Judge Sally Fudge found Ms Patel's conversations with senior officers had not influenced decisions taken on the ground.\nConvicting the defendants, Judge Fudge said that while the demonstration was \"peaceful\" it had a significant impact on the ability of businesses to function and caused newspapers to lose an estimated \u00a31m.\nThose convicted were:\nFrandsen, who has two previous convictions for similar offences, was ordered to pay a \u00a3150 fine, and to pay the court \u00a3150 with a surcharge of \u00a334.\nThe other fives defendants were given 12-month conditional discharges and ordered to pay \u00a3150 to the court and a \u00a322 surcharge.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

[to secure] the wellbeing of not only our generation, but of our children and grandchildren. Europe is ready to lead the way.\"\nThe measures are likely to push up household heating bills, as well as increase the cost of flights in the EU. Financial assistance will be available for people to install insulation and make other long-term changes to their homes.\n\"We're going to ask a lot of our citizens,\" EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said. \"We're also going to ask a lot of our industries, but we do it for good cause. We do it to give humanity a fighting chance.\"\nOpposition is also expected from some industry leaders, such as airlines and vehicle manufacturers, as well as from eastern member states that rely heavily on coal.\nOne EU diplomat told Reuters that the success of the package would rest on its ability to be realistic and socially fair, while also not destabilising the economy.\n\"The aim is to put the economy on a new level, not to stop it,\" they said.\nThe measures, billed as the EU's most ambitious plan yet to tackle climate change, have been named the Fit for 55 package because they would put the bloc on track to meet its 2030 goal of reducing emissions by 55% from 1990 levels.\nBy 2019, the EU had cut its emissions by 24% from 1990 levels.\nSome of the key proposals include:\nBut corporate lobby BusinessEurope denounced the plan, saying it \"risks destabilising the investment outlook\" for sectors such as steel, cement, aluminium, fertilisers and electric power \"enormously\".\nAnd Willie Walsh, head of the International Air Transport Association, said: \"Aviation is committed to decarbonisation as a global industry. We don't need persuading, or punitive measures like taxes to motivate change.\"\nAt the same time, environmentalist campaigners have said the proposals don't go far enough.\n\"Celebrating these policies is like a high-jumper claiming a medal for running under the bar,\" Greenpeace EU director Jorgo Riss said in a statement.\n\"This whole package is based on a target that is too low, doesn't stand up to science, and won't stop the destruction of our planet's life-support systems.\"\nClimate campaigner Greta Thunberg said that unless the EU \"tears up\" its proposals, \"the world will not stand a chance of staying below 1.5C of global heating\".\nIn September the EU Commission set out its blueprint for reaching the 55% reduction by 2030, and said at least 30% of the EU's \u20ac1.8tn (\u00a31.64tn; $2.2tn) long-term budget would be spent on climate-related measures.\nThe targets are part of a global effort to tackle climate change by cutting atmospheric pollution, especially carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.\nThe Paris climate deal, signed in 2016, aims to keep global temperature rise well under 2C, and preferably within a maximum rise of 1.5C, to prevent the worst effects of climate change.\nThe scale of this 12-pronged plan is breathtaking. It will likely have an impact on every citizen of Europe in almost every aspect of their lives.\nThe scope is so huge because the target is so tough.\nFrom 1990 to 2019 the EU cut carbon emissions by 24% - now it proposes to slash CO2 by another 31% in just 9 years. That's what's needed if the 2050 net-zero target is to be achieved.\nSo as well as boosting renewables, the EU is now set to tackle the really tough issues of home heating and transport. The proposals would see the end to new petrol and diesel cars by 2035.\nEurope's emissions trading scheme will also be reformed to include heating and road transportation. Fossil fuels used in shipping and aviation will face tax rises.\nOne of the most eye-catching proposals is a carbon border tax on goods like steel, cement and fertiliser to ensure that European industry, which has to pay for permits to use carbon, can compete. However, the proposal is contentious and could spark a trade war with China and the US.\nThe ambitious package will now face months of negotiations with member states, with poorer countries wary of new policies that could raise costs for consumers.\nThe commission is betting that instead of hordes of yellow-vest protesters taking to the streets, citizens will be willing to pay a price for cleaner air, lower emissions, and more sustainable lifestyles.\nThe rest of the world will watch this huge gamble with interest.", "image": [{"caption": "Renewable energy, like wind power, is gradually replacing coal in many EU countries", "url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0765/production/_118139810_gettyimages-1231734205-1.jpg.webp", "local_name": "BBC_2021-07-14_EU-unveils-sweeping_img1.webp", "local_path": "article_images/BBC"}], "author": null, "date": "2021-07-14", "source": "BBC", "id": "BBC_2021-07-14_EU-unveils-sweeping"}}
