It is controversial because developed countries are responsible for most greenhouse gas emissions, but developing countries see the worst effects of climate change.\\nDespite the promises made at COP26 so far, the planet is still heading for 2.4C of warming above pre-industrial levels, according to a report by Climate Action Tracker.\\nA series of agreements between groups of countries have been announced so far:", "image": [["Getty Images Oil refinery, Scotland", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1324D/production/_121531487_gettyimages-1250077114.jpg.webp"]], "author": ["Georgina Rannard"], "date": "2021-11-12"}, "https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20211115-climate-change-can-russia-leave-fossil-fuels-behind": {"title": "Will Russia ever leave fossil fuels behind?", "subtitle": null, "text": "In Russia, oil and natural gas provide both wealth and deep national pride. With global demand for fossil fuels set to decline, how will Russia adapt?\\nThe small West Siberian city of Khanty-Mansiysk, home to just over 100,000 people, is Russia's unofficial capital of oil. The town is surrounded by some of the most extensive oilfields in the world, which shape not only the region's geology but its economy and identity.\\nThe relatively short history of oil in Khanty-Mansiysk has transformed this part of Russia. The Samotlor oil field, Russia's largest, was discovered in the 1960s to the east of the city and fast became the source of the area's considerable wealth. Khanty-Mansiysk sits within the Tyumen region, which often ranks second in Russia for wellbeing and socioeconomic development, after only Moscow.\\nIn this part of Russia, oil is an important source of not only money, but pride. Since the 1960s, oil workers and engineers have been praised and featured as heroes in novels and movies. The local Museum of Geology, Oil and Gas is a major architectural landmark of the city. In the city's airport, one can see photographs of oil workers and engineers from various decades through the 20th Century, including of Russia's first president, Boris Yeltzin, meeting workers on an oil field.\\nAmid such a celebration of this fossil fuel, one could imagine that the realities of climate change haven't yet percolated to the heartland of Russia's oil.\\nBut in the last few years, that has begun to change. This year, one of the city's major oil forums, \"Oil Capital\", which took place in March, paid particular attention to climate, with panels and discussions dedicated to decarbonisation. Local officials, companies and scientists tried to understand what the future of Khanty-Mansiysk, and of Russia, might be in a new low-carbon world.\\n\"The climate agenda has been a topic here for a few years by now, ever since Russia's Climate Doctrine was adopted in 2009,\" says Irina Akhmedova, associate professor at the Oil and Gas Institute of the Yugra State University. The Climate Doctine was Russia's first political document to outline a basis for climate regulation. \"However, it is not an easy topic, especially as we are such a mono-specialised region.\"\\nDeep oil\\nOil and gas make up 80% of Khanty-Mansiysk's economy. Overall in Russia, oil and gas provided 39% of the federal budget revenue and made up 60% of Russian exports in 2019. The share of all fossil fuel rents (the price of fossil fuels minus the cost of producing them) amounted to 14% of GDP that year, according to a forthcoming paper by Igor Makarov, a researcher at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow.\\nDespite the deep entrenchment of oil and gas in its economy, Russia is very much aware of the climate crisis and has made some moves to integrate it into current and future policies. In late September, the government created a number of special cross-ministerial working groups to prepare the economy for the global energy transition. These groups will forecast risks and opportunities for Russia, with their findings feeding into an action plan to be created by the end of 2021.\\n\"The global economy is focused on a gradual transition to low-carbon energy,\" said Russia's prime minister Mikhail Mushustin, during a meeting with ministers in late September. \"This is already a new reality. We need to prepare for a phased reduction in the use of traditional fuels \u2013 oil, gas, coal.\"\\nShortly before world leaders gathered for the United Nations' recent climate talks in Glasgow (COP26), the government adopted a long-term low carbon development strategy which foresees the country reaching carbon neutrality by 2060 or before. Obligatory carbon reporting for large emitting companies was introduced earlier in 2021. Companies within Russia can also now adopt voluntary emission reduction projects and trade their emissions. (The only exception so far is the Sakhalin region in the Far East of Russia, where a more legally binding emission trading scheme is being drafted.)\\nSlow transition\\nAt the same time, many climate experts warn that Russia's emission reduction target for 2030 remains very weak. This target foresees an emissions \"reduction\" of 25-30% by 2030 from 1990 levels, but Russia's current levels of emissions are already around 30% below the 1990 levels if forest sinks are not included, and about 50% if forests are included. This means that in reality, Russia's low-carbon development strategy plans at least a 0.6% increase in emissions from today's levels by 2030. The international research group Climate Action Tracker says Russia's policies and actions are \"highly insufficient\" for a 1.5C pathway, and closer in line with a 4C world.\\nBoth the government and companies are taking an optimistic view of the prospects of oil and gas sectors in the short-term. \"In the next 20 to 30 years, industries related to oil and gas will remain one of the pillars of Russia's economy,\" says Alexey Miroshnichenko, first deputy chairman of Russia's state development bank, VEB. \"Even in the long term, renewable and conventional energy sources will coexist.\"\\nNevertheless, traditional industries will have to undergo \"a serious transformation\" in order to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, Miroshnichenko adds. Together with the Ministry of Economic Development, the VEB created Russia's first system of green finance in September, which aims to help financiers decide which projects are sustainable.\\nIt comes as little surprise that there is a reluctance in the oil and gas industry towards a fast phase-out of the fuels. Speaking at a side-event at COP26, Sergey Vakulenko, a representative of one of Russia's largest oil companies, Gazprom Neft, argued that oil and gas would still be needed even in the new low-carbon economy. Renewables might be enough to cover the majority of demand, he said, but traditional fuels would still be used as a back-up.\\nPeaking pressure\\nSome experts question how long Russia's fossil fuel industry will remain a viable prospect. \"Gas, which many are pinning their hopes on as a transitional fuel, will last for 10 to 15 years [as an economically viable fuel],\" says Evgeny Kuznetsov, a Russian venture investor and chief executive of Orbita Capital Partners. \"This period may not be enough to return investments in new large-scale gas projects.\"\\nBut others say the industry is not likely to abate any time soon. Thane Gustafson, professor of political science at Georgetown University in the US and author of the book Klimat: Russia in the Age of Climate Change, expects that world demand for fossil fuels will continue to grow through the 2020s. At the same time, supply constraints arising from decreasing investment in fossil fuels will keep energy prices high, punctuated by periodic spikes in prices, as we are seeing today.\\nBut in the early 2030s that picture will begin to change, he says, with the influence of climate politics, technological change and the clean energy transition becoming dominant. He expects world demand for oil to peak and begin to decline around this time due to the spread of electric vehicles and political limits on petrochemicals. Renewables will increasingly displace coal, he says, while gas demand will remain high but cease to grow.\\n\"The impact of climate change [action] on Russia over the next 30 years is going to be very largely external,\" says Gustafson. \"It will rise because of trends and forces that are running outside Russia and over which Russia has in fact very little leverage.\"\\nChanges inside Russia, such as the increasing cost of oil extraction as oil fields deplete, will have some impact, he adds. But the growth of electric vehicles, the continued spread of renewable energy and the progress of green legislation particularly in Europe, such as the European Green Deal, will all put external pressure on Russia, he says.\\n\"Russia has very little control over that,\" says Gustafson. \"Russia will be a 'taker' of world trends, rather than a 'maker'. And that must be, of course, a difficult realisation.\"\\nThis puts Russia in a vulnerable position, says Kuznetsov. He believes that after the current energy crisis, a drop in demand will accelerate Europe's planned reduction in fossil fuel consumption. The result could be a large number of competitors vying for a shrinking market, driving prices down.\\nVladimir Chuprov, a project director at Greenpeace in Russia, agrees that if other countries follow up with real actions on their Paris Agreement pledges, Russia will experience declining demand for coal and oil before 2030. However, in 2050 the Russian economy is still likely to be based on at least some revenue from natural gas exports, he says. Within Russia's domestic supply, he sees gas, along with nuclear, playing a leading role.\\nBut by 2050, the Russian economy will no longer be able to rely on oil and gas exports and will need to find new sources of income, adds Chuprov. \"That would be especially hard for the regional economies,\" he says. \"People will start migrating within Russia.\"\\nEnergy after oil\\nThe question is, what could be the basis of the new, post-fossil fuel economy in Russia?\\n\"This is definitely the billion-dollar \u2013 and more \u2013 question,\" says Anna Korppoo, a research professor at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Norway. Korppoo has been researching Russia's climate policy for more than 10 years and recently co-authored a report on a just transition away from coal in Russia.\\nThere are several contenders that could take the place of fossil fuels in a clean Russian economy. One option would be new sources of energy for export such as renewables, hydrogen or nuclear and potentially even decarbonised fossil energy with carbon capture and storage.\\nSpeaking at Russia's side-event at COP26, the Russian Ministry of Energy representative Pavel Sorokin touted increasing forest sinks and carbon capture and storage as priorities for the Russian fossil fuel companies, followed by further reduction of emissions.\\nSorokinalso emphasised the importance of producing green hydrogen (hydrogen made cleanly by splitting water using an electric current) as well as \"blue\" hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas but uses carbon capture and storage to attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, scientists have doubts about how sustainable blue hydrogen actually is, warning that greenhouse gas emissions from blue hydrogen can be high, particularly due to the release of fugitive methane. (Read more about the growth of sustainable hydrogen.)\\nAs the world's largest producer of nuclear power plants, with plans to develop new nuclear technologies for export, Gustafson is optimistic about the prospects for Russia's nuclear industry. \"That has been quite a story \u2013 the creation and revival of [the state corporation] Rosatom has led to a very big rise in the construction and sales [of nuclear technologies] outside Russia,\" he says. \"Russia currently has strong advantages in civilian nuclear technology compared to the United States or France or the UK.\"\\nEnvironmental activists in Russia, however, are more sceptical about plans to develop nuclear energy further as a climate solution, emphasising that nuclear energy is expensive, and that spent nuclear fuels and waste are currently stored and not further dealt with. The Russian Social Ecological Union has also said that Rosatom and Russian authorities have put pressure on environmental activists, who have faced charges and persecution for anti-nuclear campaigns.\\nResponding to these claims, a spokesperson for Rosatom says that \"Rosatom is open to dialogue and cooperation with different environmental organisations\", and that representatives of Russia's largest environmental organisations take part in Rosatom's Public Council.\\n\"Nuclear energy is indispensable for achieving carbon neutral goals,\" Rosatom's spokesperson says, adding that technological solutions to process spent nuclear fuel and turn it into new fuel for nuclear power plants are \"at an advanced stage\" in Russia. They give the example of Rosatom's Proryv project, a fast neutron nuclear reactor and a facility to process the spent fuel will be built on the same site. After reprocessing, the spent fuel will be turned into fresh fuel, in a system intended to gradually become independent of external energy supplies.\\nNature's resources\\nThere are many other options besides nuclear for decarbonising Russia's economy. Kuznetsov says that Russia could become competitive in the production of other low carbon technologies, such as equipment for smart energy grids and new heating systems. Another avenue is agriculture.\\n\"That's really been a remarkable story for anybody who remembers the state of agriculture in the Soviet period,\" says Gustafson. \"Right now, Russia is once again the world's largest exporter of wheat.\" Total revenues were about $25bn (\u00a319bn) in 2019, he adds, and Russia aims to increase that to $45bn (\u00a334bn) by 2024 through agricultural reforms. \"That seems entirely realistic, or plausible at any rate,\" says Gustafson.\\nAnother option could be expanding into sustainable forestry and wood-based products, given its ample woodland resources. Russia is home to more than one-fifth of the world's forests (approximately 7.6 million sq km/2.9 million sq miles), and the country's boreal forests, known in Russia as the taiga, represent the largest forested region on Earth, at approximately 12 million sq km (4.5 million sq miles), larger than the Amazon.\\nRussia is already an exporter of wood and wood products such as sawn wood and veneer sheets, though there has been criticism that these products are not sourced in a sustainable way. But sustainable wood-based packaging and textile materials could become an important new sector for the Russian economy, said Paola Deda, the director of forest, land and housing division at the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, speaking during a forestry-themed event at COP26.\\nGreenpeace Russia's Chuprov also sees the potential in sustainable forestry, including use of trees which grew on abandoned agricultural lands in the last decades, following the demise of the Soviet Union. According to Greenpeace estimates, since 1985 around 760,000 sq km (290,000 sq miles \u2013 an area larger than France) of former agricultural land suitable for forest growth has been abandoned in Russia for economic reasons.\\nMuch of this abandoned agricultural land (around 500,000 sq km/190,000 sq miles) could be used for diverse kinds of forestry, according to Greenpeace. Around 60% of that land is already overgrown with forests, but Greenpeace argues the remainder could be used to grow more trees.\\nForests growing on former agricultural land are one of the most important resources for the potential development of rural areas, through the creation of jobs and the sustainable production of economically valuable timber, according to a recent study published by a Paris-based think-tank Climate Chance, of which this reporter was also an author. They can also provide environmental benefits, such as increasing local resilience against natural disasters. Using planted forests for economic purposes might also help save intact primary (old-growth) forests from deforestation and unsustainable logging.\\nWith the world facing increasing global shortages of fresh water, forests, fish and arable land Russia's resources could provide a whole range of important ecosystem services, says Makarov, from biotechnologies and sustainable fish farming to responsible tourism to regenerative agriculture. Mining minerals needed for the development of renewable energy could also become a new source of wealth for Russia, he adds.\\nTo make all this possible, though, more changes are needed, says Nelya Rakhimova, coordinator of Coalition for Sustainable Development of Russia who led a civil society review of the implementation of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals in Russia in 2020. \"If Russia decides to follow the clean energy and economic transition, it will not be possible without the implementation of all aspects of sustainable development \u2013 economic, environmental and social.\" To make the most of not just Russia's natural resources, but its people, \"we need fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and open courts\", says Rakhimova.\\nRakhimova considers this a \"main barrier\" to the development of Russia. \"If we had an open dialogue with the state, if the basic rules for the adoption of laws and their implementation were in place, then the process of the energy transition itself and the formation of future Russia would be at a completely different stage,\" she says.\\nIf one thing is certain, it is that if Russia is to adapt to the global trends in clean energy, new industries are going to have to take centre stage in its economy. With their experience of economic transformation based on natural resources, Russia's oil regions may soon find themselves with another role to play.\\n\"Here in Khanty-Mansiysk, we need to develop a new economy, based on knowledge and science,\" says Tatiana Minayeva, a researcher at the Center of Wetlands Conservation and Restoration, at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Forest Science. \"We already have a foundation for that, laid during the oil boom era.\"\\n--\\nData research and visualisation by Kajsa Rosenblad\\nAnimation by Pomona Pictures\\n--\\nTowards Net Zero\\nSince signing the Paris Agreement, how are countries performing on their climate pledges?

but there was no serious violence or damage to property, and very few arrests.\\nBut despite the largely peaceful nature of the protests, there has been criticism of some of the tactics used by Police Scotland over the past two weeks.\\nThere were reports ahead of the summit that police feared they might have to make up to 300 arrests a day.\\nThe actual numbers have been far lower, with police saying on Thursday that there had only been a total of 70 arrests so far - although there have been at least eight more since then.\\nThe vast majority of these were for relatively minor public order offences, which feels like a remarkable achievement given the scale of the protests and the anger of those taking part at a perceived lack of action from world leaders over the climate crisis.\\nThe figure included 16 arrests on Monday evening when activists from Glasgow Calls Out Polluters blockaded the road outside The Engine Works in the Maryhill area of the city.\\nAnd officers had to use power tools the following day to release protesters who had blocked St Vincent Street by locking themselves together.\\nBut there was generally a carnival-like atmosphere at the protests, which were a stark contrast to the violent scenes when Scotland hosted the three-day G8 summit at Gleneagles in 2005, when about 700 people were arrested.\\nSenior police officers vowed to allow people to protest so long as they were peaceful - which the vast majority of climate activists travelling to the summit said they would be.\\nIn the end, both sides were largely true to their word.\\nPolice Scotland is the UK's second largest force behind the Met, but had to bring in 7,000 officers as well as dogs, horses and vehicles from other parts of the country to help it mount what was by far the biggest operation in its history.\\nIn particular, the Scottish force asked for officers who were specialists in public order, search and firearms.\\nUp to 10,000 officers were on duty at any one time during the conference, which Police Scotland said was needed for the safety of protestors and officers.\\nDespite the heavy and highly visible police presence at demonstrations, riot gear is not thought to have been deployed at any point - with officers wearing soft caps at protests rather than helmets, shields and batons.\\nThat fits with the general Police Scotland strategy of trying to avoid appearing confrontational when dealing with large events, and attempting to use dialogue rather than force to calm tense situations.\\nHowever, in situations where activists caused disruption by refusing to move - for example by chaining themselves together to block roads - specialist \"protest removal teams\", each with up to six officers, were deployed.\\nPolice Scotland admitted that this could often look \"quite messy\", but insisted it was necessary to ensure the city and the conference were able to continue functioning.\\nBBC Scotland's Dave Cowan, who reported from the scene of the protests, said activists were often angry at the police but did not attack them physically.\\nHe said he had seen examples of \"self-policing\" from protestors, with one man who squared up to officers being dragged away by fellow Extinction Rebellion activists who told him in no uncertain terms that they were against violence and to behave himself.\\nAnd he said there appeared to be a good working relationship between police liaison officers and representatives of the protestors.\\nThere has been criticism of the police using what it describes as \"containment\" tactics - but which is more often referred to as \"kettling\".\\nThis involves large groups of officers forming cordons which then effectively trap a crowd within a relatively small space, often for several hours.\\nProtestors are sometimes - but not always - allowed to leave through a designated exit, with the aim being to effectively use boredom, rather than violence, as a weapon to control crowds who are deemed to pose a threat.\\nIt is controversial because innocent bystanders often find themselves trapped alongside protestors, and there are concerns that it\\nThere have also been complaints from activists of officers filming and taking photographs of them while they are being contained.\\nOfficers used the tactic on the fourth day of the conference, when they held a large group of Extinction Rebellion activists in the city centre.\\nIt was again used during the Global Day of Action last Saturday, when a group of Youth Communist League members who were taking part in the mass procession through the city were surrounded by police and separated from the main march.\\nThis was said to have been done because the group had ignored police warnings about their behaviour and had instead become increasingly aggressive, with members attempting to bring the procession to a halt and flares being lit.\\nOne member of the group was arrested and charged with culpable and reckless conduct, while the remainder were later allowed to continue to the rally in Glasgow Green.\\nScottish Greens justice spokeswoman Maggie Chapman subsequently raised concerns in the Scottish Parliament about the use of kettling, saying she had heard reports of a young mother with a baby in a pram finding herself trapped for hours with no access to water or a toilet.\\nAn open letter by the COP26 Coalition, Stop Climate Chaos Scotland and the Climate Coalition called on First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to intervene to stop \"heavy-handed and intimidatory\" policing against activists.\\nThey said that the number of officers deployed was \"disproportionately high\" and, combined with \"intrusive police surveillance\", had created an \"atmosphere of fear and intimidation\" that was threatening people's right to protest.\\nBut Scotland's justice secretary, Keith Brown, said he was satisfied that the police had \"tried extremely hard to make sure that they have facilitated protest and that their response has been proportionate.\"\\nPolice Scotland appears to be pleased overall with how the COP26 operation went, pointing to the low number of arrests as proof that its approach to the protests had worked.\\nAssistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie said the overall policing tone and style had been \"friendly and accommodating\", but that any behaviour which was violent or threatened public safety public had been dealt with \"swiftly and robustly\".\\nAnd he said containment tactics had only been used by highly trained officers on a small number protestors who had been \"intent on causing violence and disruption\".\\nThe force says it wants to hear feedback on its approach from people who attended protests or who live nearby, with a survey available on its website.", "image": [["More than 10,000 police officers were on duty on some days of the COP26 summit", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/10471/production/_121537666_pa071907880.jpg.webp"], ["Most of those who were arrested were accused of relatively minor public order offences", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3947/production/_121536641_reutersa.jpg.webp"], ["The vast majority of climate protestors used peaceful methods to get their message across", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8F41/production/_121537663_reuters71922923.jpg.webp"], ["Officers were brought in from more than 40 forces across the UK to help with the Police Scotland operation", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8767/production/_121536643_reuters071851913.jpg.webp"]], "author": null, "date": "2021-11-14"}, "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-59286790": {"title": "COP26: Did India betray vulnerable nations?", "subtitle": null, "text": "The Glasgow climate deal has put India and China in the spotlight after they opposed a commitment to \"phase out\" coal while negotiating the final agreement.\\nInstead, countries agreed to \"phase down\" coal, causing disappointment and concern over whether the world can limit the average global temperature rise to 1.5C.\\n\"China and India will have to explain themselves and what they did to the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world,\" said the COP26 president, Alok Sharma. Mr Sharma also called the deal \"historic\" and said it \"keeps 1.5C within reach\".\\nEarlier drafts of the agreement contained an commitment to phase out unabated coal (unabated refers to coal that is burned without carbon capture and storage technology, which advocates say significantly decreases emissions).\\nSo what happened?\\nAt the start of the summit, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged to cut emissions to net zero by 2070, reduce carbon emissions by one billion tonnes by 2030, and raise the share of renewables in the energy mix to 50%, among others.\\nThe ambitious announcements, welcomed then, now stand in stark contrast to India's last-minute intervention to water down the language on coal.\\nChina, which otherwise shares a tense relationship with its neighbour, was a strong ally throughout the final negotiations.\\nThe summit was expected to end on Friday but went into overtime until a deal was hammered out late on Saturday night.\\nThe last day of negotiations saw China argue \"common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities\" or CBDR - it means countries that have signed the UN climate deal have a common responsibility to fight climate change, but have different capacities to do so given that they are in different stages of economic development.\\nChina said that various countries' efforts to meet the 1.5C target should be seen in the context of their efforts to eradicate poverty.\\nIndia agreed. \"How can anyone expect that developing countries make promises about phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies? Developing countries still have to do deal with their poverty reduction agenda,\" India's Environment Minister, Bhupender Yadav, said.\\nThe words \"phasing out unabated coal\" had triggered the argument. Without a consensus, there would be no final text to adopt, and that meant the summit would fail.\\nSo, key negotiators were seen huddling to secure an agreement ahead of the final session where the deal would be adopted.\\nAt first, the cameras were focussed on Chinese negotiators, including their leader Xie Zhenhua, who were speaking to US special climate envoy, John Kerry. They were also seen speaking with Mr Sharma.\\nThen Mr Yadav was seen talking to Mr Sharma and the two spoke at least twice while everyone waited for the final session to begin.\\nWhen it did, India took the floor and sought permission to make a proposal. Mr Yadav proposed that the phrase \"phase out unabated coal\" in the final draft text of the agreement be replaced with \"phase down coal\".\\nHis words were met with silence barring a few whistles in the background.\\nOnce the agreement had been finalised, various countries took to the stage to express their disappointment over the  change, arguing that \"phasing out coal\" was a major pillar to keep the 1.5C target alive.\\n\"We do not need to phase down coal but to phase out coal,\" Switzerland said, while calling the process \"untransparent\".\\n\"The longer you take to phase out coal, the more burden you put on natural environment and your economy,\" EU envoy Frans Timmermans said.\\nA heavy round of applause followed the statement.\\nSeveral small island states said keeping 1.5C out of reach would mean a death sentence for them.\\nMr Sharma, seemingly on the brink of tears, apologised for the way things had unfolded.\\nBut some experts say this could have been better handled by developed countries.\\nThe emphasis on coal while leaving out oil and gas would disproportionately impact developing countries such as lndia and China, Brandon Wu, director of policy and campaigns at ActionAid, said.\\n\"We would have liked the \"phasing out\" of all fossil fuels and not just coal,\" said Avinash Chanchal, senior climate campaigner, Greenpeace India.\\nHe added that the \"weakened draft reflected the lack of trust among rich and poor countries as previous commitments were not met\".\\nDeveloping countries such as India have argued that they are being put under pressure to move from fossil fuels to renewables, while developed countries are not helping them financially and with technology.\\n\"This text has so many lines on mitigation [emissions reduction]. What countries need to do, what they have to submit every year and even the details of upcoming high level meetings etc, but there is nothing on finance. How can we call this a balanced text?\" Mr Yadav said.\\nIndia is the third-largest carbon emitter after China and the US but its per capita emissions is around seven times lower than that of the US, according to studies, including one by the World Bank.\\nAn energy secure future is essential for India's economy - which is recovering from the pandemic while also battling sluggish growth - and coal is a big part of that goal.\\n\"The challenge is to make it a just transition to low carbon so that people don't suffer,\" says Chirag Gajjar, an energy expert with World Resources Institute India.\\n\"India's track record with renewables is solid; its target was 20 gigawatts by 2010 and by 2016 it was already heading towards 175 gigawatts.
