That allows drivers to communicate with people on the bus if there's perhaps going to be a period of sitting and waiting. We'll do our best to keep people informed.\n\"I think we expect there will be disruption and we're going to do our best to cope with that. Our primary function is to take people on their journeys as safely as possible so we will do our very best to keep that service running to time but we are advising people to plan ahead, leave extra time for their journey and to be considerate of fellow passengers and our drivers.\"\nCOP26 also means longer hours for Naomi Cornwall and her colleagues running the council's travel Twitter account from the same control room.\n\"The cameras here obviously come in very handy so there's access to over 500 cameras that I can use and zoom in if there's problems,\" she said. \"If there are any issues then we hear via the drivers radioing in but also we hear a lot from people on social media. If something has happened we'll get the message out quickly.\"\nPlanned protests, such as this Sunday's Extinction Rebellion march from the Meadows to the Scottish Parliament, will also contribute to restricted movement around Edinburgh. So too, potentially, the unannounced \"non-violent direct action\" promised by activists during the climate conference.\nFactor in major sporting events such as Scotland's sold out Rugby International against Australia next Sunday and it's clear a busy fortnight is in prospect.\nCammy Day, deputy leader of Edinburgh Council, said: \"We're working with Police Scotland and with all our transport providers to make sure that we keep the city going as much as we can but I won't pretend. With thousands more people coming to the city there will be some disruption.\"\n\"The city will be really busy with people toing and froing on trains and buses.\n\"There will be some potential closures so read what we're doing online, keep aware and do your bit to take part in COP26 whether that's reducing your carbon footprint or taking in the many events either here in Edinburgh or in Glasgow.\"\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control.

The Greens are part of the administration on 14 councils in England and Wales now and in government in Scotland.\n\"That's a steep curve, that's improving all the time.\"\nShe said the party was the \"electoral wing\" of the Green movement, and while there was a place for \"direct action in the wider political movement\", Insulate Britain is \"not necessarily always doing it in the most constructive way\".\nMr Ramsay said strong voices are needed to make the case for a Green agenda, not just on the environment but a whole range of issues.\n\"Our country is in crisis  - pumps running out of petrol, empty shelves in supermarkets and millions heading into winter fearing rising fuel bills\" he added and Green polices would \"help prevent the next crisis\".\nBy BBC Political Correspondent Ione Wells\nCarla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay put an emphasis in their campaign, and victory speeches, on becoming a serious electoral force.\nMs Denyer has often been touted within party circles as the \"obvious next MP\" and came second in the race for the Bristol West seat in 2019.\nMr Ramsay was part of the campaign team that got their only MP, Caroline Lucas, elected and has been credited with co-writing the election strategy that saw them deliver more Green councillors on more councils than ever at the English local elections in 2021.\nThey beat a number of other candidates including deputy leader Amelia Womack and Tamsin Omond, a founding member of Extinction Rebellion.\nThe new leadership were keen to stress that groups like Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion were different from the Green Party, and they don't always support their tactics, but credited the organisations for putting climate at the \"top of the agenda\".\nFor this pair though, winning influence through positions of power is a key aim.\nThey hope to use current issues like rising energy bills and empty petrol pumps to demonstrate their view that the UK is too reliant on fossil fuels.\nMr Ramsay said the Greens would create \"sustainable, secure jobs with decent rates of pay\" with policies to install insulation and renewable energy systems in homes, improve public transport system and prioritise sustainable food supplies.\nSpeaking after the result was announced, Ms Denyer said both she and Mr Ramsay would \"focus on getting more Greens elected\" at every level, including more Green MPs.\nShe said: \"It is time for the Greens to shine.\n\"We intend to lead this party to the electoral success we know is within our grasp\", adding: \"A better future is possible.\"\nMr Ramsay and Ms Denyer took 44% of the first preference votes in the leadership contest.\nAnd in the second round of voting, the new leaders secured 62% of preferences, with 6,274 votes.\nAmelia Womack and Tamsin Omond came second with 30% of first preference votes.

The airport wants to expand its terminal and transport facilities so that up to 12 million passengers can use it - a 30% rise on the 8.5 million people a year who currently do.\nNorth Somerset Council refused planning permission for the expansion last year and has been defending that decision at the inquiry.\nBut what's it like to live on the airport's doorstep? BBC Radio Bristol's political reporter Pete Simson has been to talk to people who live under the flight path on the Mendip Hills.\nAs you approach Bristol Airport from the city, there's a tiny right hand turn which takes you into the equally tiny village of Felton. Blink and you'll miss it.\nIt's here I meet Claire Czajkowska and Neil Davidge, who live with their young son and flock of chickens. They have lived in the village for eight years.\nMs Czajkowska said: \"We are in the middle of an acre and a half surrounded by chickens. It's very quiet but when a plane goes over the contrast is quite stark.\n\"They wake us up at half five in the morning- it's very loud. When they're taking off this way you can hear them in the garden and in the house and sometimes you have to stop speaking.\"\nThe couple acknowledge the house and land was affordable due to its proximity to the airport, which is just two miles (3.2km) away.\n\"We bought the house knowing fully that the airport was there and was noisy.\"\nMr Davidge, a musician who has produced for bands like Massive Attack, has to stop working when the planes go over as they produce a tone that is out of key with the music he is writing.\nFor a passionate opponent of the airport's expansion, Ms Czajkowska has a surprising affinity with flying, having grown up in Switzerland and with family in Ireland and Poland.\n\"We've been hopping on planes for as far back as I remember. I'm not against any of that,\" she said.\n\"But we've got to get real now, we've got to get sensible.\"\nFor Mr Davidge, how the expansion will impact his children and grandchildren is the main concern.\n\"We're the first generation that actually knows we're going to leave the world in a worse place for our children and I think that is terrible,\" he said.\n\"We shouldn't be expanding like this, we need to reduce emissions. We need to take better responsibility for this world.\"\nGovernment inspectors have spent the past three months listening to evidence from all sides, and will have to decide whether or not they can expand their passenger numbers, flights, car-parking spaces - increasing jobs in the process. It's a huge decision.\nOn the other side of the hill, as the jet engines roar for take-off, another opponent shares his somewhat contradictory emotions.\n\"Part of me is quite excited listening to that,\" said Steve Hogg.\nHe is the independent district councillor for the village of Wrington and its surroundings, and, despite being a fervent critic of the expansion plans, it turns out he's a trained pilot.\n\"People have called me a hypocrite. But there's a difference between pootling around in a microlight and 5,000 extra cars on the greenbelt.\"\nFor Mr Hogg, the issue has united local people like no other.\n\"In the summer I spoke at an Extinction Rebellion protest, then met with local [Conservative] MP Liam Fox the same day. We are all singing from the same hymn sheet.\n\"Wrington has a very real window on the airport's activities as do Cleeve and Winford- lots of rural communities surround Bristol Airport.\"\nHe said he would support an expansion related to an innovation in aviation but added \"this is about cheap holidays to the Med and that's what it's always been about\".\n\"How can you expand a rural airport in the heart of a community like this in the middle of a climate crisis?\"\nLocal people, however, also happen to work at Bristol Airport, and in the summer I was given access to some of their loyal, everyday staff.\nChristine is the terminal operations controller, overseeing the day to day running of the airport.\nShe said: \"When I was younger my parents used to bring me and my brother here to watch planes at the end of the runway. I always wanted to work here.\"\nThe animosity from opponents hurts, she says, especially as \"we don't make the big decisions but we are doing the daily things to do our bit, things no-one notices unless you work here\".\nThe airport does indeed have plans to become \"net zero\" by 2030.\nAn impressive feat in isolation, but given this target doesn't include emissions from flights or those travelling to and from the airport it has led to accusations of \"greenwashing\" by some critics.\nLater that morning procurement manager Susannah proudly explains the work they are doing to reduce emissions from buying sustainable products to using electric vehicles on site.\nHer straight-talking manner is endearing and when I challenge her on the contradiction of doing this while increasing flights, I get a most un-corporate response.\n\"Will you stop going on holiday? Will you stop flying because of carbon? If you ask that of everybody, I'm not sure they will.\"\nIt's her firmly-held belief that technology will make the industry less polluting in time, as cleaner ways to fly are developed.\nBack in Felton, it's a belief that's enthusiastically welcomed by Ms  Czajkowska: \"Fabulous. Do that. Get the planes running on clean fuels, with less noise. Then come back and ask us to expand.\"\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

It is everyone's task to reach an understanding and move to a new paradigm where all humanity protect nature.\n\"We need to face the greatest challenge in history together.\"\nThe group have so far been unable to bring all their representatives to Glasgow because of a shortage of accommodation in the city. Several members have been given accommodation by local people but organisers still hope to get access to a large property where more of them can stay together.\nOver the next two weeks about 30,000 people are expected to attend the climate conference.\nPolice Scotland Chief Constable Iain Livingstone, Scotland's most senior police officer, previously said his force would respond \"swiftly and robustly\" to protesters who tried to disrupt the event.\nHe said the force - together with 7,000 officers from other parts of the UK who have been deployed to Scotland to help police COP26 - was \"ready for the challenges that lie ahead\".\nDramatic protests from other groups have already begun in other parts of the city.\nSing The Change brought choirs together in George Square to sing an arrangement of Louis Armstrong's  What A Wonderful World.\nFour XR protesters locked themselves to the Memorial Gates at the University of Glasgow on Friday to demand that the establishment adopt the Green New Deal - a climate strategy developed by students and staff at the university.\nOcean Rebellion activists poured \"oil\" in front of Glasgow's Cop26 venue in protest ahead of the event.\nAndrew Darnton, an Ocean Rebellion activist and climate change researcher, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme his group had arrived in Glasgow early to get media coverage before the summit began, and had been warmly welcomed by the people of Glasgow.\nThey use \"striking visual performances\", such as setting fire to their boats or pools of dead mermaids, to convey their message about blue carbon - how the seas store carbon.\n\"We are bringing people news about the state of the seas and the degradation of the oceans and pointing out how important that is in relation to getting any kind of meaningful progress on cutting carbon,\" Mr Darnton said. \"You can't do that without the seas.\"\nHe added: \"We'd like people simply to understand that you won't fix the climate crisis without attending to the ocean.\n\"Bottom trawling of the ocean, stirring up the ocean bed, produces more carbon in a year that the whole of aviation, the whole of flying, because the seas lock up so much carbon for us.

It is already beginning to be catastrophic because nothing in nature can survive the stress that is created by these extremes of weather,\" he said.\nChallenged about his own efforts to reduce his carbon footprint, Prince Charles said he had switched the heating of Birkhall to biomass boilers, using wood\u202fchips\u202ffrom trees felled in the\u202festate's\u202fforest.\nHe has installed solar panels at Clarence House, his London residence, and on the farm buildings of his Gloucestershire home, Highgrove.\nHe said he had\u202finstalled heat pumps at some of his properties\u202fand\u202fa hydroelectric turbine in the river that runs beside\u202fBirkhall.\nHe was also challenged on his long-standing love of cars, and asked if he was \"a bit of a Jeremy Clarkson, a bit of a petrol-head?\"\n\"Well, yes\", the prince acknowledged: \"But that was before we knew what the problems were.\"\nHe said he had\u202fconverted his favourite vehicle, an Aston Martin he has owned for 51 years, to run on what he described as \"surplus English white wine and whey from the cheese process\".\nHis Aston Martin has been modified to run on a fuel called E85 - made up of 85% bioethanol and 15% unleaded petrol.\nBioethanol can be derived from different sources - including in the case of the prince's car - surplus wine and alcohol extracted from fermented whey.\nHe said most of the vehicles used on his estates were now electric but \"it can't all be done with electric vehicles\", and that hydrogen technology would need\u202fto be part of the mix as transportation was decarbonised.\nTop of the list of the concerns he had about electric vehicles was price, \"they are not cheap\", he said.\u202f He was also worried about how the materials for batteries would be sourced and how they would be recycled.\n\"At the moment there is a huge amount of waste which is really worrying,\" he said.\nThe prince acknowledged how difficult it was for most people to reduce their carbon footprint.\nHe said he had changed his diet to reduce his impact on the environment and urged\u202fothers to do the same.\nHe now doesn't eat meat and fish\u202fon\u202ftwo days each week and doesn't eat any dairy products on another day.\n\"If more people did that it would reduce a lot of the pressure on the environment,\" he\u202fsaid.\nTrees were a great way to capture carbon and improve the urban environment, he said, suggesting avenues of trees might be planted to commemorate those who had\u202fdied in the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe prince recognised that low carbon travel remains a big challenge.\u202f He said he hoped flying would become easier and more sustainable when new\u202fbio-fuels,\u202fusing carbon captured from the air with sustainably sourced hydrogen, become available.\nBut he believed\u202fsystemic change\u202fwas necessary to bring about the transformation of transportation and other industries that would\u202fbe required to drive down emissions.\n\"No one person can solve the problem,\" he\u202fsaid. \"It's a pinprick.\"\nThe prince said the key\u202fwould be making the\u202fenvironmentally friendly options cheaper for everyone.\n\"We still have fossil fuel subsidies, why?\" he asked.\nHe described as \"crazy\" the fact there were still subsidies for what he called \"insane\u202fagro-industrial approaches to farming which are a disaster in many ways, cause huge damage and contribute enormously to emissions\".\nHe said there were similar \"perverse\" subsidies for the fishing industry which he said caused\u202f\"mammoth damage\" through trawling.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control.
