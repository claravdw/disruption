Delaying this decision is good news.\"\nMr Jenrick's decision to - in effect - kick this local issue into the long grass has national significance because seven other airports as well as Leeds Bradford also want to expand their operations. They'll all be less optimistic now.\nTo be clear, the Leeds plan isn't dead. But it doesn't bode well for the airport that Mr Jenrick says he needs more time to decide whether to kill it or not.\nHis note to the airport didn't spell out his reasoning, but it's reasonable to assume Mr Jenrick wanted to avoid another bruising like the one he suffered recently after tacitly approving a plan for a coal mine in Cumbria.\nHe was forced into a U-turn on that issue.\nSo when will we get a final ruling? The government won't say, but my guess is we'll have to wait for the government's transport decarbonisation strategy due in the coming months that will show how all emissions from transport can be reduced.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

bought its 1,200 acres (500 hectares) of land and buildings dating back to the 14th Century.\nIn 2019 the trust, which runs the estate, said it was losing about \u00a38,000 a day and proposed selling parcels of land for housing, which attracted opposition from a campaign group called Save Dartington.\nIn a computer document, seen by campaigners, more than 20 members were listed alongside details of where they lived, membership of organisations, such as local authorities, and other groups, including environmental movement Extinction Rebellion.\nA number of Save Dartington campaigners made complaints to the ICO which has investigated whether the estate breached General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a law designed to protect personal data.\nIn its first response to one of the group, it said the trust \"did not have a valid reason\" to list the campaigner as an Extinction Rebellion supporter.\nIt added that by \"unnecessarily publishing\" the information \"appropriate security was not applied to the personal data\".\nThe ICO said it had \"advised\" Dartington Hall Trust that it had \"infringed the data protection framework\" and had \"provided our advice and guidance\".\nGeorgina Allen, from Save Dartington, said legal action by members of the group could follow.\n\"Collecting information on people involved in Save Dartington in this way, and then sharing it, is very sinister,\" she said.\n\"The right to protest is a key element of social justice, yet Dartington Hall trustees are prepared to undermine the right to protest.\"\nIn a statement, the trust said the document \"was only seen by two members of staff\" and was \"immediately removed\" from the computer after a director became aware.\n\"There were lots of meetings with local groups at the time and the member of staff listed the interests of those who might attend those meetings to help ensure they were as productive as possible for all in attendance,\" it added.\nThe statement said the
