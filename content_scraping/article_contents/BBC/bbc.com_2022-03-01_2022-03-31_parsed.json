They are my fellow citizens, and I don't want to disrupt their day,\" she said.\\n\"However, somehow, we need to try and get across to everybody, all of us, the gravity of the situation we are facing.\\n\"If you remember back to the beginning of Covid-19 there were scenes in supermarkets of people fighting over toilet rolls.\\n\"That is going to be nothing when you are fighting over food, water and fuel and all the basic qualities of life.\"\\nLawyers for the retired family therapist, from Westbury-on-Trym, argued she had a lawful excuse to protest following a Supreme Court ruling that said blocking a road leading to an arms fair was legal.\\nAllowing the appeal and quashing Ms Parfitt's fine, Recorder Robin Sellers said the protest was \"reasonable\" and it was important for the court \"to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings\".\\n\"In this case, limited to its own facts, we find that Rev Parfitt was exercising her Article 10 right of freedom of expression and this must be balanced against the level of disruption that is established on the evidence,\" he added.\\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
