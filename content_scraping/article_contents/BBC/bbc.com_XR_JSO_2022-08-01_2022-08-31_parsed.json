Born between 1995 and 2010, this generation have already found themselves up against immense challenges as they make their way into adulthood: climate change, inequality and social unrest, political division, economic distress and more. It\u2019s already mobilised many of these young people into action. And although they are far from the first generation who\u2019ve spoken up about injustice and other societal ills, technology has meant Gen Z\u2019s activism looks different than the movements of the past \u2013 which means their influence may be, too.\\n\u2018I\u2019m powered by the fact I have no other choice\u2019\\nActivism has long been synonymous with youth culture. From the May 1968 protests in France, and demonstrations against the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights Movement in the US, to the global Occupy movement and the Arab Spring of the late noughties, young people have a record of pushing forward social change. Gen Z is the latest chapter in the decades-long encyclopaedia of young activists, however this cohort appear to communicate, mobilise and rally support in a way that sets them apart from the generations before them.\\nRaised against the backdrop of the Great Recession of 2008, Gen Z has experienced a unique set of hurdles. Along with unprecedented societal unrest and division, their path to adulthood has been complicated by the pandemic, during which they\u2019ve seen the rising impact of global inequality. Climate change is front and centre, threatening the future of the planet they will live on. And as the world economy enters a period of looming instability, Gen Z are increasingly bearing the brunt.\\n\u201cThe sense of crisis right now is amplified,\u201d says Jessica Taft, an associate professor of Latin American and Latino Studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz whose work focuses on the political lives of children and youth across the Americas. \u201cThe extent of the climate crisis, the profound inequalities, the global creep of fascism \u2013 they are all existential threats.\u201d Of course, there have been countless perils in the past, however the potency and global nature of these historical moments is shaping young people\u2019s world views, and the role activism plays in their lives, she says.\\nFuelling Gen Z\u2019s anxiety is the fact that they are exposed to news in a different way to their parents or grandparents at the same age; young people are consuming content around social issues and events almost constantly. With just a smartphone, people can access a 24/7 buffet of reporting through social media sites, search engines, news sites and TV. Social media is fast overtaking traditional news channels among young people. Instagram, TikTok and YouTube are now the top three most used sources for news for British teens, according to the broadcasting regulatory authority Ofcom, while older generations, who grew up consuming news through print, radio and TV still favour these traditional modes.\\nWith tech-enabled devices providing constant access to news and user-generated content, escaping is no mean feat. Young people can\u2019t turn away from the discourse, so it\u2019s no wonder that many digital native Gen Zers are spurred to act on their societal grievances. They are mobilising out of fear and necessity. As 22-year-old American gun control activist and Parkland, Florida mass-shooting survivor David Hogg tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m not powered by hope. I\u2019m powered by the fact I have no other choice.\u201d\\nMore activists, starting younger\\nConstant exposure to grim realities has primed Gen Zers to deal with hardship proactively.\\nGlobal data from public-relations and research firm Edelman shows 70% of Gen Zers are involved in a social or political cause. And although not all the 10,000 people surveyed said they would call themselves fully fledged activists, they\u2019re still highly socially involved, advocating for causes they believe in through how they spend and earn. They\u2019re the most likely generation to boycott a product, company, country or state because of a political, social or environmental stance, which extends to how they pick employers, too. Just one in five would work for a company that fails to share their values.\\nMuch of their activism is driven by frustration \u2013 some research shows they\u2019re generally more disillusioned with government and other forms of political participation than their elders were. The University of Cambridge has been gathering global data since 1973, and has found young people\u2019s faith in democratic politics is now lower than any other age group. Among 18-to-34-year-olds (a mix of Gen Z and millennials), satisfaction with democracy is declining at its steepest rate. For young people in developed democracies, economic exclusion is the biggest contributor to their waning faith in institutions. Struggling with higher debt burdens, lower odds of owning a home and greater challenges in starting a family, Gen Z\u2019s discontent only grows.\\nThe pandemic certainly hasn\u2019t helped. According to research by the London School of Economics and Political Science, individuals who experience an epidemic, such as Covid-19, the Zika virus, Ebola or Sars, between the ages of 18 and 25 are likely to harbour negative attitudes toward the government and elections for a long time after the epidemic is over.\\n\u201cWhile young individuals withdraw from formal politics \u2013 which is not that surprising, given their lack of trust \u2013 they also tend to increase their participation in the democratic process via alternative and more direct means,\u201d explains Orkun Saka, co-author of the paper, visiting fellow at LSE and assistant professor of economics at City, University of London. This includes activities such as attending demonstrations, protests, boycotts and signing petitions. Saka believes the silver lining of the post-epidemic decline in trust may lead young people to feel they would like to take matters in their own hands. \u201cThey may become more critical towards their political leaders and governments, which is not a bad consequence in and of itself,\u201d says Saka.\\nParticularly notable is the age at which Gen Z\u2019s activism begins \u2013 in general, earlier than the generations that have come before them. Greta Thunberg launched her first protest outside the Swedish parliament at 15, which Subir Sinha, a lecturer in the theory and politics of development at SOAS University of London, believes set off a domino effect, whereby young people had a role model who was angry, and with good reason. \u201cShe \u2026 did not appear packaged,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is post-celebrity activism, whereby her ordinariness and lack of glamour is part of her appeal.\u201d\\nMany young activists have followed in her footsteps, gaining global recognition for speaking on climate change issues as young as eight, like Licypriya Kangujam from Manipur in India. At 10, she has just successfully campaigned to have all plastic pollution cleared from the area surrounding the Taj Mahal.\\n\u201cThe idea that there may not be a future, or if there is one, it could be heavily diminished, plays heavy on their minds,\u201d says Sinha. \u201cClimate-change activism used to deal with abstract scientific concepts, but with annual forest fires, floods, drought and record heat, plus the news and social-media coverage of all this, we can feel climate accelerating and that adds to a sense of impending apocalypse.\u201d\\nThis is why many young people, who see climate change as an existential threat in their lifetime, are participating so vocally in movements and demanding a seat at the table in global negotiations.\\nAn audience at their fingertips\\nGen Z activists and their older peers are united in their concern over the same issues \u2013 climate destruction, gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights \u2013 but their voices appear louder and more urgent because they have more ways to source inspiration, disseminate information and mobilise. While older generations set the precedent for grassroots activism and in-person demonstrations, Gen Zers have brought this activity into where they are most comfortable: digital spaces.\\nAt their most basic function, digital spaces enable Gen Zers to develop their civic identities and express political stances in creative ways, from noting their sexual orientation in their Instagram bio, to joining groups aligning with their interests on the chat-room platform Discord. The online world offers somewhere for them to claim the agency they may not get in traditional civic spaces like their schools, universities or workplaces. A 2020 study from the UK Safer Internet Centre showed 34% of 8-to-17-year-olds say the internet has inspired them to take action about a cause and 43% say it makes them feel their voices matter.\\nThe nature of this relationship makes it easier to then exercise one\u2019s civic identity and participate, both offline and online, in social change movements. From the comfort of a bedroom, someone can broadcast a message from a social media account, or build a new platform, without having to wait for a journalist to catch wind of it, or for a TV show to offer a primetime slot. While leafleting, telephone campaigns, word of mouth and canvassing might have been the catalysts for broadcasting a movement in decades before, now Gen Z can harness all this \u2013 and more. TikTok videos, hashtag movements like #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter, podcasts and \u2018hacktivism\u2019 have expanded the mediums through which young people can speak out and be heard.\\n\u201cThere are newer mechanisms through which they are mobilising collectively and because of the pandemic, more emphasis has gone on organising remotely, which may not require people to get together physically in large numbers,\u201d says Sinha. He believes that what differentiates Gen Z from older generations is the proliferation of technology in young people\u2019s social and political activity, and how intuitively they use it. One minute they\u2019re reposting cat memes, the next they\u2019re flooding Starbucks with fake job applications in a stand against the company\u2019s decision to fire workers attempting to unionise.\\n\u201cThey understand certain mediums so much better, and know how to make things go viral in a way, unlike those of us who weren\u2019t born into computer and mobile phone culture,\u201d says Sinha. In contrast, he recalls working with fish workers in the 90s, who were rallying against the corporate trawling sector and its mechanic fisheries. Local communications had to be written as a letter, typed out and then faxed to all the movement\u2019s international branches.\\nToday, a movement like this would look dramatically different, he argues \u2013 both bigger and faster, since the internet and smartphones have now democratised \u2013 and sped up \u2013 the path to power and access to a voice as an activist. Jackson-McKenzie believes social media grants individuals access to their very own press tool. \u201cThis allows us to narrate our own stories, which is why I think Gen Z has succeeded in so many activism efforts,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are wholly interlinked to connect across the world.\u201d\\nWith social media throwing the window wide on all forms of activism, Gen Z has the capacity to raise awareness about the issues disturbing them, even if the path to concrete change is still long. Still rooted in local struggles and realities, contemporary social movements are increasingly \u201cglocal\u201d, operating both globally and locally, with offline and online networks overlapping. Many of the recent youth-led street protests have been organised online, with Twitter, TikTok and Instagram serving as hubs for information and networking.\\nFrom the Arab Spring to Black Lives Matter, youth-led movements are gathering momentum through digital means and result in large-scale transnational protests. One notable example saw children from primary level upwards walk out of school to demand action against climate change in March 2019. The 1.4 million-strong School Strike for Climate \u2013 the largest of its kind in history \u2013 captured global attention through documenting local protests on Twitter, with this \u2018glocal\u2019 posting expanding its reach and encouraging others to organise their own versions. The strikes clearly had an effect, as concern about the climate crisis peaked in the same month the strikes took place.\\nActivism as identity\\nWith technology collapsing Gen Z\u2019s personal identities into their activism, this sense of self may well follow them through their lives, having multiple impacts, and showing up in all kinds of spheres.\\nSocial media has blended Gen Z\u2019s personal and professional lives, offering no delineation between who they are and how they advocate. Nadine Khaouli has been active in the volunteering and social action space since she was 13, and now runs a humanitarian non-profit Kafe Be Kafak (meaning \u2018hand in hand\u2019 in Arabic) alongside her full-time job as a youth delegate with the UN Development Program. On her personal social media accounts \u2013 Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn \u2013 she documents and amplifies her own views and progress as well as posts volunteering and job opportunities.\\n\u201cI like to show my followers how we\u2019re facing the day-to-day hustle in Lebanon \u2013 it\u2019s about using my personal journey and my story to inspire the work I do,\u201d says Khaouli. \u201cI don\u2019t feel the pressure of blurred personal and professional lives because my activism is so aligned with my mission to end poverty in Lebanon.\u201d\\nThese indistinct boundaries feel natural for McKenzie-Jackson too, as he doesn\u2019t see his activism as a profession. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a community and family, versus a workplace, which is probably why so many of us are involved in movements,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting impactful work done in a way that makes us feel fulfilled.\u201d\\nHe believes finding friends and partners through activist networks, and inextricably linking their identities with their beliefs, means that those who are already invested are unlikely to end their involvement anytime soon. It will simply transfer into the new spheres they encounter, whether it be the workplace or more activist circles. Being involved in several movements, Jackson-McKenzie can\u2019t see himself stepping away. \u201cOnce you\u2019re involved, you can\u2019t stop because you learn and understand more, and it becomes much more serious and scary,\u201d he says.\\nForced to grow up fast due to a string of societal crises, there\u2019s always the potential Gen Z could outgrow their activist tendencies as they take on more responsibilities in their lives. However, research on the 60s generation shows that commitment to the same kind of political beliefs stays consistent over time. \u201cThe narrative that one becomes more conservative as they age isn\u2019t held up by evidence,\u201d says Taft. \u201cPeople who were activists \u2013 organising and involving themselves in these collective spaces \u2013 continue to be committed to making social change happen in various ways, while those whose involvement drops off tend not to be especially engaged. I don\u2019t see why this wouldn\u2019t apply to Gen Z.\u201d\\nInvested in activism for the long term, and organising their lives around their commitments to various movements, rather than the other way around, this generation stands to make headway with their demands \u2013 provided older generations are ready to listen. \u201cThere\u2019s always been a problem of ageing people seeing youth movements as too idealistic,\u201d says Sinha. \u201cAny radical or progressive movement with ambitions to survive needs to make space for young people and their ideas about what should change and how that should be done.\u201d\\nThat said, activism living on the same platforms that older generations use for work and play could be narrowing the ideological divide between them. Equally, research shows that Gen Z\u2019s passion for change is revitalising the generations above them too, with the trickle-up effect hard to ignore. Globally, 52% of people of all generations believe teenagers and college-aged people influence how we create change. It\u2019s impacting older generations too: 35% of 56+-year-olds agree this cohort influences how they support the causes they care about, jumping to 50% among 42-to-55 year-olds.\\nThe summer of 2022 has already spotlighted a multitude of new and timeworn issues that will remain highly contentious going forwards. And while today\u2019s young activists face many of the same hurdles as those before them, they have a wholly different set of tools at their fingertips that grant them the loudest voices of any generation in history. With a fresher take on all the ways we\u2019re getting life wrong, they\u2019re angry and unafraid to speak up.\\n\u201cAfter the pandemic, the challenge is remobilising people and empowering them to take actions \u2013 a lot of the time people are feeling depressed about what\u2019s going on,\u201d says McKenzie-Jackson. \u201cActivism isn\u2019t just actions or social media, it always starts with a passion, and people need to be in touch with that first \u2013 everyone has a voice that can turn society on its head, it\u2019s just about feeling empowered enough to use it.\u201d", "image": [["Courtesy of Nadine Khaouli (Credit: Courtesy of Nadine Khaouli)", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0cqsvmq.jpg.webp"]], "author": ["Megan Carnegie"], "date": "2022-08-08"}, "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62532840": {"title": "Climate activists fill golf holes with cement after water ban exemption", "subtitle": null, "text": "Climate activists in southern France have filled golf course holes with cement to protest against the exemption of golf greens from water bans amid the country's severe drought.\\nThe group targeted sites near the city of Toulouse, calling golf the \"leisure industry of the most privileged\".\\nThe exemption of golf greens has sparked controversy as 100 French villages are short of drinking water.\\nGolf officials say greens would die in three days without water.\\n\"A golf course without a green is like an ice-rink without ice,\" G\u00e9rard Rougier of the French Golf Federation told the France Info news website.
