If everything goes well, the public won't notice how commanders and demo organisers have worked out how to make an event safe.\nBut when it goes wrong, then the inevitable accusations of failure come piling in.\nSunday dawned badly for the Metropolitan Police's commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick. Her officers were accused of oppressing women and politicians waded in calling for her head.\nBut the seeds for Saturday's PR disaster for the force were sown in the legal dispute over whether a vigil could take place at all - and how events then seemed to run out of control.\nThe question is whether the police should have foreseen that happening. That, time and again, is the great challenge of public order policing.\nEarlier in the week it became increasingly clear that people up and down the UK wanted to hold vigils for Sarah Everard.\nWomen in London, organising under the Reclaim These Streets banner, approached Met commanders for their help in setting up a vigil on Clapham Common in south London, close to where Ms Everard was last seen alive.\nThe police said a demo would be illegal under the coronavirus lockdown regulations.\nAnd so the women and their lawyers asked the High Court to make a declaration that would force the police to think again.\nThe problem is that the law is not that clear cut.\nFor almost a year, the ambiguities and omissions within the coronavirus restrictions have left both the police and the public grasping for answers as to what is possible in public. It's so complex we've even seen people fined for walking while holding a cup of tea.\nGatherings in public are generally banned in England but, at the same time, the rules recognise there are \"reasonable excuses\" to be outside.\nBut the law doesn't specify whether a demonstration on a major issue of public importance - such as this vigil - is one of those excuses.\nNo matter what the Covid regulations say, there is an overarching right to freedom of expression that is enshrined in the Human Rights Act. That means the police have a legal duty to help make safe protests possible.\nBut that right is not an absolute trump card - it can be interfered with if the police can show they have good reason to stop an event happening.\nAnd after hours of difficult legal argument on Friday, the judge refused to intervene and basically told the two sides to work it out for themselves with all those legal principles in mind.\nIn the absence of further legal clarity, the organisers claimed victory. They said the police had to now negotiate a sensible well-run vigil.\nThen, the police pushed back hard. They said they too had been vindicated. They could not authorise a potentially unlimited demonstration that would become an enormous Covid-spreading event. Stay at home, they said.\nBy Saturday morning, the organisers abandoned their plans amid a very serious risk they could each face a \u00a310,000 fine for organising a lockdown-breaking gathering.\nBut by that point, it was inevitable that people would turn up at Clapham Common, whether or not there was going to be a public event. It was the talk of social media.\nSo given that racing certainty, and the lack of official marshals that Reclaim These Streets said they would have provided had the police agreed to a vigil, what was the police's plan to keep people safe?\nThe turning point in Scotland Yard's tactics appears to have been the start of speeches from the bandstand, around 18:00 GMT. People pressed forwards to hear.\nAssistant Commissioner Helen Ball said: \"At this point, officers on the ground were faced with a very difficult decision.\n\"Hundreds of people were packed tightly together, posing a very real risk of easily transmitting Covid-19.\"\nAnd so, they tried to break up that part of the gathering and remove people whom they believed were contributing to the crowding.\nPatsy Stevenson, the red-haired woman caught on camera being handcuffed on the ground at the bandstand, received a \u00a3200 Covid fine as police tried to remove her from the area.\nShe has not been accused of, or charged with, violence - but was there any elsewhere?\nThere was definitely a lot of anger - with some of the crowd chanting obscenities at the police at one point.\nThe Metropolitan Police Federation, representing frontline officers, says 26 of them were assaulted yesterday at Clapham - punched, kicked and spat at.\nPictures obtained by the Press Association clearly show three instances of officers being forcibly pushed and a van's wing mirror being deliberately vandalised. Guess what? All three instances involved men, not women.\nAssistant Commissioner Helen Ball has said the Met did not want to be in the position where it had to turn to enforcement. But what's not clear is why this demonstration was considered to be so much more of a Covid risk than others that commanders couldn't find a way to make it possible.\nPolice forces elsewhere in the UK were waiting for a lead from the Met. But those that saw DIY vigils - albeit far smaller ones - appeared to take a stand-back approach.\nThe better comparison is Black Lives Matter last summer, when there were large crowds in London and elsewhere that were clearly not socially distancing.\nWhy the difference? That, and other questions about how the operation unfolded, may have been answered in the report that's been sent to Home Secretary Priti Patel.\nShe's now asked Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to carry out its own external review of the event - and what Ms Patel ultimately concludes may dictate whether Dame Cressida survives calls for her to go.\nWhile the commissioner is accountable to the Mayor of London, who has raised his own serious concerns after a meeting with Dame Cressida, the Home Secretary is jointly responsible for deciding who gets the job - and when they should go.\nDame Cressida is highly respected both in policing and government - far more so than some of her predecessors - but she remains a controversial figure for many others.\nShe commanded the 2005 operation that led to the shooting dead of Jean Charles De Menezes, after he was mistaken for a suicide bomber - although a jury exonerated her of any personal wrongdoing.\nMore recently, she called for better powers to deal with Extinction Rebellion's repeated occupations of parts of London. The government agreed - and the home secretary's proposals to greatly expand the police's ability to curtail demonstrations goes before Parliament on Monday.\nAsk most police officers who have experience of covering public protests, and they will tell you they often feel - individual mistakes besides - it is a no-win situation when things go wrong. (Just last week I was talking about this very dilemma on BBC Newscast.)\nIt would be something of a terrible twist of fate for the commissioner - the first woman in the post - to lose her job in these circumstances.", "image": [{"caption": "Met officers were accused of oppressing women on Clapham Common on Saturday night", "url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/77A3/production/_117572603_hi066218255.jpg.webp", "local_name": "BBC_2021-03-14_Sarah-Everard:-What_img1.webp", "local_path": "article_images/BBC"}, {"caption": "People laid flowers and paid tribute to Ms Everard at the common throughout Saturday", "url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/113E3/production/_117572607_hi066211913.jpg.webp", "local_name": "BBC_2021-03-14_Sarah-Everard:-What_img2.webp", "local_path": "article_images/BBC"}], "author": ["Dominic Casciani"], "date": "2021-03-14", "source": "BBC", "id": "BBC_2021-03-14_Sarah-Everard:-What"}, "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-56487102": {"title": "A city of protest: Bristol\u2019s history of resistance", "subtitle": null, "text": "A city of protest throughout history, Bristol has a rich timeline of resistance.\nSome have sparked change for good while others have ignited confrontation and rioting, like the violent clashes with police at the Kill the Bill demonstration on Sunday.\nThe city's counter-culture identity reaches back through the centuries and includes notable events in history that have seen it take the spotlight on a national and international stage.\nSo how is modern day Bristol influenced by echoes of its protest past?\nDr James Watts, a teacher and researcher in history at the University of Bristol, is investigating the city's heritage of protest.\nIt comes as part of the We Are Bristol History Commission, set up by mayor Marvin Rees in response to the toppling of the Edward Colston statue during a Black Lives Matter protest last June.\nHe said: \"There is a long history of protest in Bristol and a radical self-identify is more prevalent here, but why Bristol and not other cities is a difficult point.\n\"Bristol has always been a city of protest with an alternative identity that pushes back on those mainstream or established narratives.\n\"Protest is very richly woven into the city's history and I think the people of Bristol today are influenced by that narrative of protest.\"\nAnother factor could be the geography of the city, he says.\n\"Centres of protest like Stokes Croft or St Paul's are a stone's throw away from more affluent areas like Clifton, where you also have a high student population where people are very interested in a different way of living.\"\nDr Watts cites the Bristol Bridge riots in 1793 as the first notable clash with the establishment in the city.\n\"This was about the toll on the Bristol Bridge, the main bridge across the river, and it was seen as one of the most serious of the 18th century - soldiers were called in, 11 people were killed and 45 people were injured.\"\nA century later in 1831 the Queen Square riots took place when Bristol was swept by violent clashes for three nights in opposition to the House of Lords blocking a popular electoral Reform Bill.\nAround 100 buildings, including the mayoral Mansion House, Bishops Palace and Custom House, were burned down.\nHundreds of protesters died, 90 people were sent to prison and four people were hanged.\nWriter and historian Dr Edson Burton said Bristol had a history of socialist movement which created an \"articulate and organised working class from the 19th century\".\nHe said: \"High levels of inequality in Bristol are part of the fabric from the 18th century, particularly in terms of class, and there has always been a strong trade union presence and Methodist movement here which created a social awareness and a hub for working class socialist thinking.\n\"There are people across generations in Bristol who have taken action which makes protest normative, for generations here today it is not a question of whether you take action, but how you take action.\"\nHe added rioting had historically been \"a frustration of the people, with a more generalised unease that makes it harder to control so they escalate and take on their own narrative\".\nFast forward to the Bristol bus boycott in 1963, which arose from the refusal of the Bristol Omnibus Company to employ black or Asian bus crews.\nLed by youth worker Paul Stephenson and the West Indian Development Council, the boycott of the company's buses by Bristolians lasted for four months until the company removed the policy.\nThe boycott attracted national and international attention and helped pave the way for the UK's Race Relations Acts of 1965 and 1968.\nDr Burton added: \"Protests like the Bristol Bus Boycott were organised with clear aims and strategies which minimises demonstrations turning into something different.\"\nRegarded as heralding the start of a decade of unrest in English cities and forcing racism into the spotlight, the St Pauls Riots in 1980 were among the worst disturbances Bristol had seen - with the people of St Pauls battling with police after a raid on the Black and White Caf\u00e9.\nAfter several hours of rioting, 130 people were arrested and 25 people were hospitalised.\nSome involved in the disturbances argue a racist police force provoked it, but officers involved in the raid maintain they were trying to prevent crime.\nThe Stokes Croft protests and riots in 2011 grew from objections against a new Tesco store in the area well known for its independent businesses.\nTwo nights of violence broke out after police raided a squat where officers believed petrol bombs intended for the Tesco shop were being made.\nEight officers were injured and several arrests were made following clashes between around 300 protesters and around 160 police.\nA third night of rioting followed a week later after a further peaceful protest against the presence of Tesco.\nThroughout 2019 Extinction Rebellion protesters staged several blockades of roads in Bristol and in February last year 15,000 people attended a rally by environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg.\nThe Black Lives Matter protests in June 2020 saw Bristol make headlines around the world once more after a statue of Edward Colston was toppled and thrown into the harbour.\nPolice were praised for their handling of the largely peaceful protest for deciding not to intervene and the event led to the city having to confront its slave-trade heritage.\nPolice said a \"tactical decision\" was taken by officers at that protest not to intervene.\nBut at Sunday's Kill the Bill protest, Chief Constable Andy Marsh, of Avon and Somerset Police, said an event that started peacefully in College Green had been \"hijacked by extremists\", by \"people who were determined to commit criminal damage\".", "image": [{"caption": "Thousands joined the Kill the Bill protest on Sunday, but police said it was later 'hijacked by extremists'", "url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1B21/production/_117654960_mediaitem117654959.jpg.webp", "local_name": "BBC_2021-03-23_A-city-of_img1.webp", "local_path": "article_images/BBC"}, {"caption": "The statue of slavetrader Edward Colston was thrown into Bristol's harbour after a Black Lives Matter protest in June", "url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6560/production/_117525952_colstondumpedpicreuters.jpg.webp", "local_name": "BBC_2021-03-23_A-city-of_img2.webp", "local_path": "article_images/BBC"}, {"caption": "Thousands took part in the Black Lives Matter protest in Bristol city centre", "url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/EE25/production/_112756906_bristol2pa.jpg.webp", "local_name": "BBC_2021-03-23_A-city-of_img3.webp", "local_path": "article_images/BBC"}], "author": ["Aleisha Scott"], "date": "2021-03-23", "source": "BBC", "id": "BBC_2021-03-23_A-city-of"}}
