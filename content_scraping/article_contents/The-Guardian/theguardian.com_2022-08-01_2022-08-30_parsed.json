Its music is graceful, poised and smooth, but it is also an almost conceptual set of songs about the urgency of the climate crisis and the disorientation of living in a culture that still refuses to acknowledge it. According to its chief creator, the singer-songwriter and former actor Tamara Lindeman, many of its songs evoke what happens when \u201cthis veneer of \u2018everything will be OK\u2019 disappears\u201d. That moment of revelation is perfectly captured in one song I have played over and over again \u2013 which is simply called Loss, and finds Lindeman recalling a conversation: \u201cWhat was it last night she said? At some point you\u2019d have to live as if the truth was true.\u201d\\nAmid unprecedented temperatures, fires and the grim pantomime that will eventually end with the selection of our next prime minister, I suspect more people than ever would now understand those words as a matter of direct emotional experience. For millions of us, this summer\u2019s heat is synonymous with an anxiety that is now impossible to shake off, and a renewed awareness of the small transgressions and outright hypocrisies that are required to get through each day. We perform them because of something that Lindeman\u2019s lyrics consummately describe: that very human talent for just about averting our eyes from what is directly in front of us, so as to live a quiet life; and a political culture that just about keeps the \u201ceverything will be OK\u201d veneer in place.\\nThese are things evident across the planet, and the UK has its own grim versions of them. One of the two remaining Tory leadership candidates has pledged to retain the current de facto ban on onshore windfarms; the other wants to reconsider some of the key policies built into the government\u2019s milquetoast 2050 net zero target (the positions of Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, respectively). The Labour party has one big climate policy \u2013 its \u00a328bn-a-year climate investment pledge \u2013 but is still not putting global heating anywhere near the centre of its basic message, and is thereby failing to acquire much consent for action on it.\\nMeanwhile, for a certain kind of media voice, the past week has been all about raging against climate sceptics and deniers and their influence on politics, as if pointing out that they are mendacious and dangerous is an act of bravery. The former BBC presenter Andrew Marr provided a good example in a monologue broadcast on his new show on LBC: \u201cI for one have had enough of being told by pallid, shadowy, old businessmen and lazy ignorant hacks and sleazy lobbyists \u2013 who aren\u2019t real scientists, any of them \u2013 that the science is wrong and that what is happening isn\u2019t happening,\u201d he said. \u201cEnough!\u201d\\nThe key question of 2022 is not whether those people are wrong, both factually and morally: we know the answer to that. For the moment, I don\u2019t think many people need to be thinking very much about particular parties or politicians. What we surely need to focus on is the deep attachment to fossil fuels still locked into our economy and political system, and how to help the movements that definitely want to end it: Extinction Rebellion (XR), Insulate Britain, Just Stop Oil and the other forces that clearly understand the unspeakable gravity of the moment. This comes down to a question that still does not intrude on politics nearly enough: as these groups take the most direct kind of action, do you support them? And if \u2013 or, rather, as \u2013 the climate emergency deepens and the awful gap between politics and the sheer scale of what we are faced with only widens, what will you think if their actions take new, ever-more disruptive forms?\\nTo some extent, the way our media and politicians fend off the climate crisis accidentally confronts people with exactly those arguments. In one of our most regular national rituals, mainstream politics barely intrudes and instead, a protester fresh from some or other climate action is berated by Piers Morgan, Richard Madeley or one of the presenters from GB News or TalkRadio, and the only real options become clear: meaningful and radical action or nothing at all. An editorial last week in the Sun insisted that \u201cwe need a sober debate, free from the extremists\u2019 juvenile panic, on how we inch towards Net Zero in decades to come\u201d, which made panic look like much the more sensible option. In April, the Labour party demanded that the government take legal action to effectively ban climate protests that disrupt traffic and oil production. When he stood to be his party\u2019s leader, Keir Starmer took donations from a former boss of the RAC and AA, and the latter company-cum-lobby group\u2019s former chief financial officer. The people he apparently thinks should be locked up, by contrast, are motivated by a comparatively pure mission to confront the car industry and quickly finish the hydrocarbon era, and thereby avoid catastrophe. So who do you choose?\\nIn some cases \u2013 Occupy is a good example here \u2013 sustained support for protesters and activists has bumped up against their lack of a coherent agenda. But the modern climate movement is not like that. The basic position shared by the central handful of groups is clear enough: net zero by a much earlier date than 2050. XR and the people backing the climate and ecology bill \u2013 including such politicians as the Greens\u2019 Caroline Lucas and Labour\u2019s Clive Lewis \u2013 envisage that change being driven by citizens\u2019 assemblies, set up to decide how such an aim will be reached. In the context of Westminster politics, such ideas may seem so unlikely as to be barely worth considering. But remember: Brexit is a madcap, massively disruptive project that defies just about every element of political and economic sense, but was until recently the preserve of cranks and obsessives and only became a reality when David Cameron decided to bypass MPs and ask the rest of us to decide. Less than a decade after it decisively burst into the political foreground, moreover, we are locked into it for keeps, with the support of both main parties. By comparison, is trying to set an example to other countries by doing exactly what the climate demands really so fanciful?\\nActivism and protest often trigger a kneejerk suspicion that they will alienate people and kill whatever cause they advocate. But experience suggests the exact opposite: just as successive waves of social reformers, the suffragettes and the anti-apartheid movement were stubborn, daring and creative enough to make their demands irresistible, so the people now lying in roads and charging into airports and refineries have conveyed the urgency of climate breakdown more successfully than anyone in a suit. There is a very good reason for that: it is only well outside centres of power that you can find the answer to a question that power and politics are dodging more than ever \u2013 how to live as if the truth is actually true.\\nJohn Harris is a Guardian columnist\\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Here\u2019s how to tell the difference and protect yourself, your friends and family \u2013 and your pets\\nThe train tracks are on fire and the NHS may declare a level 4 heat emergency (there\u2019s no level 5). This is a summer of unprecedented temperatures, with more, and worse, to come. \u201cThe world is undoubtedly experiencing more extreme heating,\u201d says Martin Siegert of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change, highlighting \u201cliterally unbearable\u201d temperatures in India and Pakistan this year. \u201cWe are now, on average, 1.2C (2.2F) warmer than we should be because of our emissions. This means that things, sadly, will get worse.\u201d An extra 0.3C (0.5F) is \u201cunavoidable\u201d, meaning, Siegert says, \u201cExtreme heating episodes will continue to increase in frequency and severity. Unless we deliver net zero by mid-century, temperatures will rise well above the 1.5C (2.7F) level, with terrible consequences for climate heating in ways we have yet to witness fully.\u201d\\nThe only solution is to take action, using our votes and voices to press politicians to reduce emissions, urgently. Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and many other charities have practical suggestions on how you can get involved. But right now we, our parents, grandparents, children and even pets are all at risk of heat exhaustion and, worse, heatstroke. What are the warning signs? What can you do to prevent it and treat it, and when do you need urgent medical help?\\nIn heatstroke, the brain loses the ability to regulate body temperature, potentially leading to a cascade of damage to the liver, kidneys, muscles and particularly the heart. It can develop rapidly, with little warning, and can be fatal. But before you reach the danger zone of heatstroke, most adults will experience symptoms of heat exhaustion. \u201cHeatstroke is an emergency; heat exhaustion is not normally so,\u201d says Dr Lynn Thomas, medical director of St John Ambulance.\\nIt is a good idea to look at reliable symptom guides for heat exhaustion and heatstroke online, but in essence, heat exhaustion is that unwell feeling most of us have experienced at some point in very hot weather. \u201cYou may notice dizziness or being slightly confused, headaches, cramps; you\u2019d be sweating, cool skin, feeling sick, have a faster breathing rate and quicker heart rate,\u201d says Dafydd Beech, of the Red Cross National Community Education Team.\\nIn contrast, a person suffering from heatstroke may still have dizziness, headache and discomfort, but crucially, their skin will become hot, flushed and dry. \u201cThe body is losing its ability to sweat,\u201d says Thomas. \u201cIt can\u2019t lose any of that heat and it just keeps getting hotter and hotter. That can cause people to become quite confused. They can become unconscious, or have seizures and fits.\u201d This is the danger zone: \u201cIf somebody is not improving with water and being cooled down; if they\u2019re not sweating, even though it\u2019s really hot; if they\u2019re not managing to keep water down or drink water; if they have a temperature above 40C (104F) or they become unresponsive \u2013 please ring 999 no matter how busy it is,\u201d says Thomas. She suggests using speakerphone. \u201cUnfortunately, heatstroke could lead to somebody having a cardiac arrest. Hopefully you won\u2019t get to that point, but if you do, the call handler will talk you through everything you need to do.\u201d\\nIt is trickier, of course, to recognise the symptoms in yourself, especially when one of them is confusion. \u201cThere is absolutely an increased risk of people developing heat exhaustion and heatstroke if they live alone,\u201d says Thomas. \u201cYou may not notice you\u2019re feeling a bit confused, because how would you know?\u201d Beech advises to look out for any sense that \u201cthings start to feel worse, like: \u2018Something\u2019s not right here.\u2019\u201d\\nIn addition to the basic advice to stay in the coolest part of your home, and avoid exertion, Thomas\u2019s advice is to stay hydrated, \u201cand keep an eye on how often you go to the bathroom: urine should be light-straw-coloured\u201d. It is also important to be aware of the possible effects of any medication you are taking: \u201cSome antidepressants can reduce the ability to manage high temperatures or reduce your ability to sweat,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cEnsure that you\u2019ve got a method of calling on help if you need to do so,\u201d adds Beech. \u201cHave your phone near you.\u201d\\nFirst aid for people afflicted by heat exhaustion and heatstroke is mainly common sense: move the person to a cool place, give them water to drink (this may not be possible for heatstroke sufferers), and try to cool the skin. Thomas suggests \u201ca sponge or spray or ice packs; pour some water on the skin because that helps evaporation.\u201d For more serious cases, Beech suggests \u201cwrapping the person in cold, damper clothes\u201d. It is important not to try to cool a heat exhaustion sufferer very rapidly, which can lead to shock. \u201cWe sometimes hear about throwing the person into cold baths: you shouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d says Beech. The aim is \u201cslowly and steadily cooling the person down\u201d.\\nThe symptoms of heat exhaustion and heatstroke are the same for older adults, but they can be more vulnerable to dehydration, and may lose the urge to drink, which can increase the risks of heat-related illness. \u201cThe worry in elderly people is that they don\u2019t always recognise some of the signs,\u201d says Thomas. \u201cPlease check on your elderly relatives and neighbours way more frequently than you would normally; try to get them to stay inside and keep the curtains closed.\u201d It can be difficult, she says, to persuade dementia sufferers in particular to drink. \u201cMaybe put some water next to them with some ice in it; check they are drinking it. Tea is fine, thank goodness.\u201d\\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult with children, because they love being outside and they won\u2019t necessarily say: \u2018I need to go inside because I\u2019m hot.\u2019 So, make sure they are going to the loo regularly and having lots to drink,\u201d says Thomas. Symptoms of heat exhaustion and heatstroke are much the same in children as they are in adults, but note that when babies are suffering from heat exhaustion, often they \u201cget sleepier and don\u2019t interact as much\u201d.\\nTo keep babies cool, \u201cstay indoors or go out early\u201d, says Claire Maguire, a National Childbirth Trust post-natal practitioner. When you do go out, avoid clipping a muslin to the buggy or pram for shade: \u201cResearch says this can cause the inside of the pram to heat up and cause the overheating you were trying to prevent in the first place.\u201d Maguire recommends getting familiar with your baby\u2019s normal temperature (test on the back of the neck or the chest, not the extremities, which are cooler). \u201cThat way you know when they\u2019re too hot.\u201d\\nInfant safe sleep guidelines recommend bedrooms should be at 16-20C (61-68F): tough in this weather. Maguire\u2019s top tip is to three-quarters fill a two-litre bottle of water, freeze it, cut the plastic away, then stand it upright in a large roasting tin in front of a fan for half an hour or so before using a room. \u201cNever point a fan directly at a baby,\u201d says Maguire; they struggle to adapt to changes in temperature.\\nMaintaining hydration is vital, too. \u201cBabies are very vulnerable to dehydration because of their volume-to-surface-area ratio: if they get dehydrated it can affect their health much more quickly than someone larger,\u201d says Maguire. Breastfed babies may want to feed more often, she says; formula-fed babies can have small quantities of water regularly in a \u201cfree-flow sippy cup\u201d (boiled and cooled if they are under six months). Keep a tally of wet nappies: \u201cIf you have an older baby, you\u2019re probably used to the frequency of their wet nappies,\u201d says Maguire. \u201cIf you have a much younger baby and you\u2019re not quite sure what the rhythm is, it\u2019s around six nappies a day.\u201d If you\u2019re in any doubt at all, Maguire says, call NHS 111, and the free NCT support line (0300 330 0700) can give individual advice on summer feeding. The Red Cross also has a free baby and child first aid app.\\nOur furry housemates are also vulnerable to heat-related illness, says Dr Karen Humm, an emergency and critical care clinician at the Royal Veterinary College. Those that are overweight, those with thick fur designed for cold temperatures or flat-faced (brachycephalic) dogs such as pugs and bulldogs are even more at risk. \u201cDogs don\u2019t sweat, really,\u201d Humm says. \u201cSo if they can\u2019t pant effectively, they can\u2019t lose heat effectively.\u201d\\nThe warning signs that your dog may be dangerously overheating, Humm says, are \u201cnon-specific and that\u2019s why it\u2019s hard\u201d. Panting excessively or more noisily than usual is a key warning sign. Chris Wilson, a small-animal vet based in London, says dogs can also seem \u201crestless, or listless and out of sorts\u201d. More severely heat-affected dogs can drool, or suffer vomiting or diarrhoea, and at worst, collapse and suffer seizures.\\nIt is important, both agree, to act fast, well before this happens. Once an animal suffers heat-induced enzyme damage, this can be irreversible, even leading to multi-organ failure and death. \u201cIf you\u2019re not sure and they don\u2019t seem quite right, ring the vet. If they\u2019re breathing noisily, definitely ring the vet. If they are uncoordinated, stumbling, if they appear a little drunk or difficult to rouse or have collapsed, go straight to the vet \u2013 ring them when you\u2019re on the way,\u201d says Humm. \u201cThe emphasis is on stopping them from reaching that stage,\u201d agrees Wilson.\\nPrevention is best. \u201cKeep them shaded, keep them calm, offer them water,\u201d recommends Humm. You can cool dogs with water applied to the skin, although Wilson warns that if you use a wet towel, it\u2019s important to replace it regularly: \u201cThey can dry out really fast and end up insulating the dog further.\u201d Dog behaviourist Louise Glazebrook says some dogs enjoy a paddling pool, or cubes of frozen bone broth to play with or chew on. \u201cPut fans on, leave cold water with ice packs underneath, give access to cool, tiled surfaces and give cooling snacks, such as hard-boiled eggs or carrots from the fridge.\u201d Clip hairy dogs short, she advises: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how they look: they need their belly and chest plate area to be clipped very short to allow their body to make contact with cool surfaces.\u201d\\nPeople now mainly know not to leave dogs in hot cars, Humm says, although it does still happen.\\nThe next key message to get across is that on very hot days, it is vital only to walk dogs extremely early in the morning or late at night, or even not at all. \u201cThere\u2019s a misconception that an animal won\u2019t go for a walk if it\u2019s bad for them, and it\u2019s just not true,\u201d says Humm. In a recent study, she says, three-quarters of heat-related illness cases were brought on by exercise. \u201cIf in doubt, leave your dog at home to rest and be in peace,\u201d says Glazebrook, who notes that dogs\u2019 tolerance of touch, petting and being handled is likely to decline in the heat, potentially leading to irritability. \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t want to be touched. It\u2019s even worse for them \u2013 they have fur coats on!\u201d\\nBy contrast, cats rarely suffer heat-related illness unless they are trapped or without access to water. \u201cThey\u2019re evolutionarily from much hotter places,\u201d says Humm. \u201cCats are much more sensible than dogs,\u201d adds Wilson. \u201cThey are quite good at regulating their temperature behaviourally.\u201d They are, however, \u201cnotoriously bad drinkers. So leaving taps running, leaving glasses of water around, or some cats like to lick condensation off frozen bottles of water \u2013 all these are things you can do to make sure they\u2019re getting enough fluids.\u201d\\nSpare a thought, too, for rabbits in hutches in hot sunny places, Wilson says: \u201cPeople forget about them at this time of year. Keep them in the shade, in cooler areas, make sure they have access to water and move them inside if you can get it cooler indoors.\u201d", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c26b690acb61754efa5645b1e58d3ef36349f211/120_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Keep hydrated, but if you are not improving with water or struggling to keep it down, it may be time to dial 999."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98da83eb6c765d6ffa1c80c7f6e82889996994bd/0_192_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Keep drinking water, and keep an eye on how often you\u2019re going to the toilet."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e118e4b1f7748cc5a299efd82295c0a4037724bc/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Often, children won\u2019t tell you that they want to cool down indoors."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03ff04b1c3ad3412190e02ceab9d1a44bbddef77/0_299_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Clip hairy dogs short, give them cold treats, and spare them the walks."]], "author": ["Emma Beddington"], "date": null}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/26/there-is-an-alternative-to-disruptive-climate-protest": {"title": "There is an alternative to disruptive climate protest", "subtitle": null, "text": "Prof Rupert Read believes a moderate flank of activists who can bring people together is the way forward, while Cllr John Dearing urges people to get elected to local councils to make a difference.

I\u2019m proud to have helped launch Extinction Rebellion (XR), which, along with Greta Thunberg, most facilitated that breakout. But does disruptive protest remain the only way forward?\\nHarris appears to suppose that the only alternatives are either to back the radical flank or to be, at best, timid incrementalists. But the emerging moderate-flank strategy supposes something different: that the most effective thing to do now \u2013 while not shying away from how grim things are \u2013 is to meet people where they are and bring the majority with us. The radical flank is not capable of doing this. It (we) briefly did in April-May 2019, but such wonderful moments are rare.

If, however, we take advantage of the radical flank\u2019s achievements and facilitate a much larger cohort to march through the window we opened, then even now, we might win. \u201cWinning\u201d will not be a smooth transition; it\u2019s way too late for that. Winning now will be avoiding an uncontrolled civilisational collapse.\\nWhat is such a moderate flank looking like?

Central government has responsibility for national climate policies, but there is scope for local councils to take more progressive action.\\nDespite financial constraints, local authorities have the ability to raise energy standards of new council-owned buildings, provide safe cycling and walking, ensure effective waste recycling, increase numbers of electric vehicle charging points, manage open spaces for biodiversity and carbon sequestration, lead the way in natural flood management, and more. They can bid for government funds for retrofitting homes and decarbonising public buildings, promote local investment in renewable energy and, crucially, engage with the public and businesses about what the climate crisis demands.\\nThe public is far more supportive of local climate actions than the media gives it credit for. Many will vote for candidates who present reasoned and sensible arguments for progressive policies, even if they vote for a different party at general elections.

We Are Here Venice, an NGO that promotes the safeguarding of a city deeply affected by climate breakdown and countless human-made activities, invited me on board the Greenpeace ship the Rainbow Warrior, the purpose of whose visit was anything but touristic.\\nI have taken part in two Arctic tours with Greenpeace: one on the Esperanza (now defunct, not my fault!) and another on the Arctic Sunrise. I had previously sailed with two of the crew who are now on the Rainbow Warrior, and there they still were, fighting for climate justice around the world.\\nA couple of weeks ago, as Britain beat not only its own all-time temperature record, but Cuba\u2019s, Singapore\u2019s and Panama\u2019s, there were still people shouting that it was all perfectly normal and just an ordinary sunny day. What sort of fantasy world do these people live in, and who built it for them? My trip to Venice helped me answer this question.\\nI didn\u2019t know it when I arrived, but Greenpeace activists were about to stage a protest that involved moving through the canals of the lagoon city on traditional boats, while carrying the logos of major European oil and gas firms that use greenwashing \u2013 marketing techniques that try to convince us they are environmentally friendly when the opposite is true : they want to keep us hooked on fossil fuels. This is killing the planet. The activists ironically announced it as the Last Tour of Venice, as the city is at risk of submersion due to climate impacts in the Mediterranean region, like the ones we\u2019ve been recently witnessing with record-breaking heatwaves and wildfires raging across the region.\\nLast October, Greenpeace and another 30 organisations launched a European citizens\u2019 initiative calling for a new law banning fossil fuel advertising and sponsorship in the EU, similar to what happened with tobacco at the beginning of this century. If the petition collects a million signatures in a year, the European Commission is obliged to respond.\\nWhy is such a law important? Now, with widespread public support for climate action and the scientific community unreservedly pointing at the fossil fuel industry as largely responsible for the climate crisis, the oil and gas firms, which have for decades purposely slowed climate action, are at their most vulnerable. The industry is clinging on to advertising and sponsorship as one of the last ways of staying afloat.\\n\u201cDelay and deceive\u201d is the new denial. Fossil fuel companies are pumping millions into greenwashing while making meaningless net zero promises and introducing false \u201csolutions\u201d, in order to gloss over their decades of destruction. They are falsely painting themselves as allies and extending the deadline of their obsolete business.\\nScientists have had enough. For the first time, this year an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report exposed the disinformation strategy by saying: \u201cWho dominates the debate on media, and how open the debate can be, varies significantly across countries based on participants\u2019 material and technological power. Fossil fuel industries have unique access to mainstream media via advertisements, shaping narratives of media reports and exerting political influence in countries like Australia and the US.\u201d\\nMore than 450 scientists also signed a letter calling on PR and advertising agencies to stop working with fossil fuel firms and stop spreading climate disinformation. This is the first time so many scientists have called out the role of PR and advertising in fuelling the climate crisis.\\nOil and gas companies buy prestige by sponsoring museums, influencing the sphere of knowledge by putting money into universities, and gaining popularity when their logos are associated with sport. They invest a lot in buying a social licence to continue with business as usual by creeping into our everyday lives and disguising the damage. We need to urgently kick them out of our brains, hearts and communities.\\nIn the last year, thanks to relentless grassroots work, Harvard University said it would phase out its fossil fuel holdings. In the UK, the National Portrait Gallery and Scottish Ballet confirmed they wouldn\u2019t do further sponsorship deals with BP. Tennis Australia has dropped gas firm Santos as a partner.\\nAt the beginning of this century the EU banned tobacco advertising and sponsorship after it was recognised they increased consumption and hid health warnings. Now, with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate breakdown and its indisputable link to fossil fuel companies, it is time to ban fossil fuel propaganda for being deadly and criminal, and driving us inexorably towards climate catastrophe.

The disclaimer policy that is applied on Meta advertising is something that Shell fully supports.\\n\u201cInitial enquiries suggest that the disclaimer was, in error, not applied to some recent Shell content, and we are investigating this with our media buying agency.
