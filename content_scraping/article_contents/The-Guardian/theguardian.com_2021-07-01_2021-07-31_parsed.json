But it will struggle for their attention", "subtitle": null, "text": "The party is addressing job insecurity. Yet its proposals aren\u2019t sparking the controversy that an opposition party needs\\nMany things have disappeared from British politics since it became mostly about the pandemic. One of the most important has been the idea that the interests and grievances of people under 40 are worth a lot of attention from the main parties.\\nDuring the Jeremy Corbyn era younger voters enjoyed rare influence, reinvigorating Labour and frightening the Conservatives. Even when that period effectively ended at the 2019 election, Labour beat the Tories among voters aged 18 to 24 by an unprecedented 43 percentage points. The sea of young faces at Corbyn rallies looked like a mass awakening that would have consequences.\\nYet since then our politics has aged again. The Conservatives under Boris Johnson have prioritised elderly people and treated the young with contempt. From the culture wars to the chaos in schools, benefits cuts to the climate crisis, the government\u2019s message to younger Britons has been consistent: you don\u2019t matter. Meanwhile Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour party has followed a milder version of the same strategy, concentrating on the often older voters it has lost while offering its younger supporters little.\\nBut the desire of many young people for a different Britain has not gone. Beyond parliamentary politics, even people on the right acknowledge it. Earlier this month free-market thinktank the Institute of Economic Affairs published Left Turn Ahead, a survey of young people\u2019s attitudes towards capitalism and socialism.\\n\u201cYounger people really do quite consistently express hostility to capitalism, and positive views of socialist alternatives,\u201d it found. The common argument that \u201cthey will grow out of it\u201d, the survey continued, \u201cis simply not borne out by the data. There are no detectable differences between the economic attitudes of people in their late teens and people in their early 40s\u201d. These attitudes might be \u201ca preview\u201d of \u201cmainstream opinion in Britain tomorrow\u201d.\\nDespite this eye-catching conclusion, the IEA\u2019s report has received relatively little attention. It doesn\u2019t fit the prevailing view, on both the left and the right, that Britain is in a conservative phase that still has a long time to run. There is also a widespread, in some ways contradictory, assumption that young voters have always been leftwing \u2013 that their discontent with the status quo is nothing new.\\nBut that assumption is mistaken. At every general election from the late 1970s to the early 1990s, and again in 2010, as many or more under-45 voters chose the Tories as Labour. The radicalisation of the young, which has also happened in other parts of Europe and the United States, is a new feature of 21st-century western politics.\\nOne reason for this radicalism\u2019s spread and persistence, despite its lack of electoral success, is that it is rooted in everyday experience \u2013 in particular, the modern experience of work. Zero-hours contracts, exploitative internships, graduates stuck in cafe jobs, a decade of stagnant wages, general precariousness. Work for all but the most privileged young employees is a daily reminder of capitalism\u2019s diminishing rewards.\\nThese malign trends affect older workers too \u2013 which may be why, at the last election, Labour won more votes than the Tories from working Britons. But older workers may at least have savings or property, acquired when work was more rewarding. Only the under-45s have spent their entire working lives in the \u201cflexible\u201d labour market the Conservatives created and New Labour largely accepted. No wonder many young voters feel alienated from both parties.\\nSo the launch by Labour earlier this week of a \u201cnew deal for working people\u201d could be significant. Not just as the beginning of an answer to the charge that Starmer has no policies, but also as a set of possible reforms to Britain\u2019s increasingly Victorian work culture, and as a way for Labour to reconnect with the young electorate it needs to remain a viable party in the long term and have a chance of returning to power.\\nGiven Starmer\u2019s caution up to now, Labour\u2019s proposals are surprisingly ambitious. They include \u201cthe right to flexible working for all workers \u2026 from day one of employment\u201d \u2013 unless there is a conclusive reason that a job cannot be done flexibly or remotely. This flexibility could mean working hours arranged \u201caround school runs and other family and caring responsibilities\u201d. Labour envisages work \u201cfitting around people\u2019s lives rather than dictating their lives\u201d.\\nThe party also wants to create \u201ca single status of \u2018worker\u2019 for all but the genuinely self-employed\u201d, and to abolish the current qualifying periods for basic employee rights such as sick pay, holiday pay, paid parental leave and protection against unfair dismissal. It wants all workers to \u201chave stable, secure employment\u201d, and the right to \u201cdisconnect from work at home outside of working hours\u201d.\\nLabour claims these measures would \u201cfundamentally change our economy\u201d, and it is hard to argue. The balance of power between employer and employee would be significantly altered. Yet this idea has not provoked the kind of outrage this week that you might expect. The employers\u2019 organisation the CBI said that, like Labour, it wants \u201can inclusive economy\u201d, and criticised the party\u2019s proposals only in limited terms, as \u201coverly prescriptive\u201d.\\nLabour people involved with promoting the policies see the lack of controversy as a success. One source says: \u201cWhen we talked about work under Jeremy Corbyn, we sounded too radical and endlessly triggered the rightwing press. It was a disaster. This time, we\u2019re not going to lead with our chins.\u201d\\nWhile the detail of the proposals has been laid out by Angela Rayner and Andy McDonald, two relatively leftwing figures, the broad case for them has been presented by Starmer in studiedly conservative and patriotic language: that a job should provide \u201cdignity and security\u201d, and that Labour \u201ccan make Britain the best place to work\u201d. Thus his party hopes to appeal both to young voters and older ones. \u201cWhether you\u2019ve got a mortgage on a semi in Barnsley or you rent in Kentish Town\u201d, says the Labour source, \u201cyou\u2019re currently getting done over at work.\u201d\\nThe problem with Labour\u2019s approach is that inclusivity can become blandness. In confrontational times, as both Corbyn and Johnson came to understand, getting attention and mobilising voters often involves naming enemies. This week, Labour\u2019s work policies got far less coverage than the government\u2019s cartoonish hi-vis crime measures.\\nIf Labour doesn\u2019t win back young people soon, these voters have alternatives. The Greens are already higher in the polls than they have been for years. Protest groups such as Extinction Rebellion have compelling causes and novel tactics. Even the Conservatives could conceivably appeal to the young again: they\u2019ve done it before.\\nYoung voters have decades to decide their political trajectories. Starmer has far less time.\\nAndy Beckett is a Guardian columnist", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dac44433c4a18ad30ed249b6949778104aef08ff/0_232_5660_3398/master/5660.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Protesters during the 2019 climate protests in London.

It\u2019s become a sort of mental list to which I turn from time to time when considering our current political situation. \u201cPowerful and continuing nationalism\u201d (tick); \u201cdisregard for human rights\u201d (what was that about offshore asylum camps?); \u201crampant cronyism and corruption\u201d (you bet).\\nThen, of course, there\u2019s \u201cdisrespect for intellectuals and the arts\u201d \u2013 something that had been festering long before the Brexit vote but became even more explicit then, with ministers\u2019 contempt for \u201cexperts\u201d.\\nIt seems people have had enough of artists too, if two recent incidents are anything to go by. First, we had a police raid on Antepavilion, an east London arts complex. Footage emerged of black- and navy-clad helmeted police (some of the helmets had union flags on them, a nice touch) forcing entry to the building. The venue\u2019s best known exhibit is a rooftop bamboo and cable structure called All Along the Watchtower. The structure resembles those that were used during Extinction Rebellion (XR) protests last year when the environmental campaigners blockaded the printing presses of Murdoch papers (XR were planning further protests at the time, which likely explains the motives behind the raid).\\nHowever, the artist Damien Meade says this sculpture was part of an architectural competition and was not affiliated to XR. Moreover, it took six weeks to install, so could not play any role in a protest at short notice. Five people were arrested and then released without charge.\\nThe second incident involved a group of Conservative councillors in Southend-on-Sea, who succeeded in removing the installation How to Make a Bomb: An English Garden by the artist Gabriella Hirst.\\nThe work, situated in Shoeburyness in Essex, centres on a nearly extinct species of rose that was created and registered under the name Rosa floribunda Atom Bomb in 1953. It took the form of a rose garden with benches adorned with plaques detailing Britain\u2019s nuclear history, and containing statements such as: \u201cThe garden is a reminder that the red rose of England is entangled with an Imperial past of \u2018gardening the world\u2019, which has continued into a dangerously over-armed present\u201d.\\nThe councillors objected to one such plaque, which highlighted the devastating impact of British nuclear tests on Indigenous lands in Australia in the 1950s and 60s. They asked for it to be removed or reworded, with one councillor calling it \u201ca direct far left wing attack on our History, our People, and our Democratically Elected Government\u201d (authoritarians just love an unnecessary capitalisation), and threatened to contact the media. As a result of the councillors\u2019 campaign, the artwork has been taken down, with Metal, the organisation that co-commissioned the work (alongside artists\u2019 charity the Old Waterworks), saying it did so to protect its staff.\\nBoth of these incidents are chilling. For all their proclamations about protecting freedom of speech, in their interactions with artists the Conservatives are revealing a disturbing autocratic tendency. The same is true of the government\u2019s attitude towards academics, as the latest higher education (freedom of speech) bill demonstrates. The Tories have been convincing large parts of the electorate that they are the true custodians of British history, and that the \u201cwoke brigade\u201d will tear down every statue in the land if it has its way. It\u2019s blatant hypocrisy.\\nIn 2018 there was a furore over the temporary removal of John William Waterhouse\u2019s Hylas and the Nymphs \u2013 which depicts nude girls \u2013 as part of the artist Sonia Boyce\u2019s residency at the Manchester Art Gallery. Amid the row, barely anyone seemed to care that the takedown took place during a performance art piece.\\nInstead, the action was framed in the media as censorship and taken entirely in bad faith, by rightwing and liberal commentators alike. The latter seemed to give scarcely any thought to the damage wrought by going along with an argument set by the cynical and the reactionary.\\nThe original intent behind the act of removal, a conversation about what and who hangs in a gallery and why, was completely lost. By reframing Boyce\u2019s attempts at discussion and contextualisation as censorship, the right was winning an early battle in the culture war. Yet who is really attacking artists and cultural institutions?\\nThere\u2019s a longstanding joke, as popularised by The Young Ones, that leftwing people go around calling other people fascists all the time. Perhaps there are times when we are overzealous, but sometimes it feels as though, while everyone was busy guarding the statue of Winston Churchill, a separate agenda was cranking into gear about other works of art. As Meade wrote in the aftermath of the police raid, historical statues are protected by laws that give offenders up to 10 years in prison, but if the artwork is deemed subversive, \u201cthe full muscle of the state comes knocking\u201d.\\nCall me a doomsayer if you want, but I\u2019ll keep ticking off that list.\\nRhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cf43e8205a86f23fd18e3a1d25ba495ea3e69c5/378_219_876_526/master/876.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Post-It notes on Sonia Boyce\u2019s performance art piece about John William Waterhouse\u2019s Hylas and the Nymphs, Manchester Art Gallery."]], "author": ["Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett"], "date": "2021-07-20"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/14/england-footballers-new-generation-britain-progressive-young-": {"title": "England\u2019s footballers speak for the new generation better than any politician", "subtitle": null, "text": "The team are typical of Britain\u2019s progressive young people, unafraid to voice their anger with the status quo\\nInstead of a trophy, England\u2019s national team have inherited something far more precious: the mantle of the official opposition.\\nFor most of the nation\u2019s under-40s \u2013 the generations known as millennials and zoomers \u2013 Tory Britain represents a double-pronged onslaught on their economic security and deeply held social values. When Marcus Rashford \u2013 a \u201c23-year-old black man from Withington and Wythenshawe\u201d, in his own words \u2013 shamed the government into feeding hundreds of thousands of children, he was leading a rebellion on behalf of that most voiceless demographic, the young working class. Since 2010, when the Conservatives came to power with the help of the Liberal Democrats, 800,000 children in working households have been driven below the breadline; however momentarily, they were handed one of the nation\u2019s loudest megaphones. When the England team took the knee, they affirmed the value of the lives of Black people in a nation whose government has cynically fanned racism for electoral ends, up to and including constructing a hostile environment that deported Windrush-generation Britons from their own country.\\nBoris Johnson and his acolytes refused to condemn the booing of their own national team for a very simple reason \u2013 they knew that those baying ghouls represented a crucial pillar of their support base that they did not want to alienate. When Conservative ministers then had the front to condemn the racism directed at England\u2019s players, which they helped legitimise, it fell to England centre-back Tyrone Mings to point out the hypocrisy. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to stoke the fire at the beginning of the tournament by labelling our anti-racism message as \u2018Gesture Politics\u2019,\u201d he tweeted, \u201c& then pretend to be disgusted when the very thing we\u2019re campaigning against, happens.\u201d\\nThat this is England\u2019s most outspoken national team is no freakish accident. Hailing from across the nation \u2013 from south Manchester to Bath to Neasden \u2013 they are unmistakable products of their generation. Young people have for some time now been revolting against an ancien regime in Westminster that is rigged against their living standards and their progressive values; and however flush these players\u2019 bank accounts are, they cannot escape where they came from.\\nI know that talk of youth revolt can trigger a weary, \u201cheard this all before\u201d roll of eyes, followed by cliched references to how the young inevitably become conservative as they grow older. Yet this youthful revolt is new. Our understanding of the politics of the 1960s is warped by US college campus revolts: American youths were more likely to support the Vietnam war and the segregationist presidential candidate George Wallace than their elders. In Britain, the historian Dominic Sandbrook has pointed out that just one in ten young Britons went to university in the 1960s, and surveys of students tended to show little sympathy with the left. The anti-Vietnam war demonstration in Grosvenor Square in 1968 became the stuff of protest legend, but there were just 10,000 there, my late father among them.\\nWhen Margaret Thatcher attacked the postwar social democratic settlement, she did so with the active support of much of the young, who rewarded her with a decisive lead in 1983: her populist \u2013 but unrealised \u2013 promise that rolling back the state would liberate the individual captured the then zeitgeist. Some of those then youthful Thatcherites would later be satisfied with New Labour\u2019s accommodation with free market economics, but many in their older years returned firmly back to the Tory fold.\\nAs research by the rightwing thinktank the Institute of Economic Affairs underlines, younger Britons today have markedly shifted leftwards. Two-thirds would prefer to live in a socialist economic system, 72% support public ownership of industry and large majorities blame capitalism for the climate emergency and the housing crisis. The authors of the report were particularly disturbed by the staying power of these convictions: \u201cIt is no longer true that people \u2018grow out\u2019 of socialist ideas as they get older.\u201d\\nThe progressive social values of the young have undoubtedly been forged by the accumulation of successful struggles for the rights of minorities and women over many decades. Those outlooks become embedded in popular culture, reflected back by key cultural influencers, reinforcing their hegemony among younger generations. Mass mobilisations in support of movements ranging from Black Lives Matter to Extinction Rebellion \u2013 both on the streets and online \u2013 disseminate these ideas further. The young are also a diverse cohort: by 2015, one in three English primary students were from an ethnic minority. While, for instance, British newspapers light the touchpaper of moral panic against trans people, the young \u2013 and particularly younger women \u2013 support this profoundly marginalised minority in ever greater numbers.\\nThose values have welded with profound economic insecurities: these generations have only known shredded youth services, a slashed welfare state, student debt, an all-consuming housing crisis, often precarious and low-paid work, and stagnating or falling wages. These are not the consequences of sadism on the part of the Tories: they are simply the logical endpoint of the government shoring up an older, socially conservative voter coalition by driving up house prices, keeping their tax burden low and tapping into their most reactionary impulses. For now, it works: those loyal true-blue voters have made it abundantly clear that they will stick by Johnson\u2019s Conservatives. Meanwhile, the Labour party has abandoned the most elementary functions of opposition.\\nBut fury simmers among the country\u2019s younger generations, and it will erupt to the surface in diverse ways \u2013 from protests to the viral tweets of football players.

Shunts can cause derailments, which is especially dangerous for trains carrying explosive materials.\\nAs Brooks installed the shunt, a Burlington North Santa Fe (BNSF) railway officer received an alert and photo from a game camera (a motion-sensing camera) near the tracks. Police arrived and found Brooks and another woman, Ellen Brennan Reiche, on the tracks with a bag containing a drill and wire, and arrested them.\\nOn 9 July, Brooks pleaded guilty to violating Title 18 of the US Code, which prohibits terrorist attacks and violence against railroads.

In the most serious incident, on 22 December, a train derailed and caught fire in Custer, Washington, spilling 29,000 gallons of crude oil and prompting the evacuation of 120 people nearby.\\nAt a pivotal time for both Indigenous rights and the climate crisis, activists are increasingly turning to direct action, including blockading railways and other critical infrastructure. But the deliberate sabotage of railways marks a dangerous escalation in this strategy that is now prompting terror charges.\\nIn past decades, eco activists found themselves at odds with Indigenous groups (Greenpeace opposing the Inuit seal hunt, for example), but now radical environmental activists are aligning themselves with Indigenous struggles.\\nOn 7 January 2020, the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en nation called for solidarity from Indigenous and non-Indigenous people after a judge granted an injunction against its community members, who have never signed a treaty or sold their traditional territory.\\nBy this time, the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en had already faced one violent raid by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who had authorized lethal force against them. \u201cLight your sacred fires and come to our aid as the RCMP prepares again to enact colonial violence against Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en people,\u201d they said in a statement. They asked that people act peacefully.\\nFrom coast to coast, people took to the streets and blockaded rail lines, halting trains for weeks and prompting layoffs of VIA Rail employees.\\nOn 22 January, an anonymous poster wrote on an anarchist blog that the mass protests had inspired them to sabotage trains in Washington state. \u201cThis simple action can generate enough confusion in the system to cause big slowdowns and bureaucratic delays,\u201d they wrote. Their goal was to disrupt economic activity, calling BNSF, the largest freight railroad in North America, \u201ca primo target for blockages and slow downs\u201d.\\n\u201cIf the RCMP raids Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en territory, we will shut down the supply lines where we stand,\u201d the poster wrote.\\nIn February 2020, the RCMP again aggressively raided Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en camps. Through 2020, activists appear to have carried out their promise; at least 40 shunts appeared on railway tracks in Washington State. In May 2020, an anonymous poster also claimed responsibility for sabotaging train tracks in Hamilton, Ontario.\\nMeanwhile, though a shunt wasn\u2019t involved in the Custer derailment, the incident was no accident, according to Russ Quimby, a former National Transportation Safety Board investigator with 22 years of experience investigating railway incidents. Based on details provided by KUOW, Quimby told the Guardian someone had disabled the air brake system and separated the link between two rail cars while the train was unattended. \u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s not going to take place just at random or because of vibration \u2013 that\u2019s a deliberate act,\u201d he said.\\nThe timing of the incident, after Brooks and Reiche already faced charges, and the use of different methods, led Quimby to believe more than two people were sabotaging trains.\\nWhen trains carrying hazardous materials derail, they can explode, poison groundwater, prompt evacuations and threaten the lives of people nearby, such as railway staff, he explained. In 2013 a train carrying hazardous materials accidentally derailed and exploded in Lac M\u00e9gantic, Quebec, killing 47 people. Quimby called it \u201ca good example of how bad things can get\u201d.\\nBefore 2020, Quimby could recall only one other incident of rail sabotage in the US: the unsolved 1995 derailment of an Amtrak passenger train in Arizona that killed one person and injured 78.\\nSteven Beda, assistant professor of history at the University of Oregon, said the recent sabotage reminded him of Earth First, a movement of radical activists who vandalized logging equipment, destroyed logging roads and spiked trees in the Pacific north-west in the 1970s and 1980s. Tree spiking is a method of hammering metal into trees that makes it dangerous, even deadly, for logging workers to saw trees.\\n\u201cA lot of these things were meant as a form of psychological warfare \u2026 especially with tree spiking, to make loggers so afraid that they don\u2019t want to go to work,\u201d Beda said.\\nBeda believes the shunting incidents are part of a decentralized radical activist movement with no leader. Recent anarchist blog posts contain detailed explanations of how to install shunts. Beda said Earth First took a similar approach: publishing literature on how to spike trees and telling people, \u201cdo with it what you will\u201d.\\nBeda said Earth First and the people installing shunts appear to share the belief that change cannot happen through the courts or political systems, so they make the leap into sabotaging economies and industries, at any cost.\\n\u201cThis is a debate that is hardly unique to the environmental movement \u2013 the labor movement, the civil rights movement, the women\u2019s movement \u2013 any major social movement in world history has had this debate about whether they should go through the political and legal systems to get the change they want, or whether they should engage in more radical forms of activism,\u201d Beda said.\\nMolly Wickham, spokesperson for Gidimt\u2019en Checkpoint, a Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en camp opposing the Coastal Gaslink pipeline, told the Guardian she was \u201cvery disturbed by the news that young people who are supporting our struggle are facing trumped up terror charges.\\n\u201cTo see that supporters of Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en sovereignty are facing up to 20 years in prison tells me that the state is very fearful of Indigenous resistance and those who support Indigenous resistance,\u201d she wrote in an email.\\nShe said the #ShutDownCanada movement inspired many people who believe that dramatic change to the capitalist, colonial system is necessary, and that Canada\u2019s actions toward Indigenous people has deep roots in genocide.

The oil giant committed to installing hundreds of thousands of charging stations for electric vehicles around the world to help offset the harm caused by burning fossil fuels.\\nOn the same day, Shell issued a separate report revealing that its single largest donation to political lobby groups last year was made to the American Petroleum Institute, one of the US\u2019s most powerful trade organizations, which drives the oil industry\u2019s relationship with Congress.\\nContrary to Shell\u2019s public statements in support of electric vehicles, API\u2019s chief executive, Mike Sommers, has pledged to resist a raft of Joe Biden\u2019s environmental measures, including proposals to fund new charging points in the US. He claims a \u201crushed transition\u201d to electric vehicles is part of \u201cgovernment action to limit Americans\u2019 transportation choice\u201d.\\nShell donated more than $10m to API last year alone.\\nAnd it\u2019s not just Shell. Most other oil conglomerates are also major funders, including ExxonMobil, Chevron and BP, although they have not made their contributions public.\\nThe deep financial ties underscore API\u2019s power and influence across the oil and gas industry, and what politicians describe as the trade group\u2019s defining role in setting major obstacles to new climate policies and legislation.\\nCritics accuse Shell and other major oil firms of using API as cover for the industry. While companies run publicity campaigns claiming to take the climate emergency seriously, the trade group works behind the scenes in Congress to stall or weaken environmental legislation.\\nEarlier this year, an Exxon lobbyist in Washington was secretly recorded by Greenpeace describing API as the industry\u2019s \u201cwhipping boy\u201d to direct public and political criticism away from individual companies.\\nSenator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat and strident critic of big oil\u2019s public relations tactics, accused API of \u201clying on a massive industrial scale\u201d about the climate crisis in order to stall legislation to combat global heating.\\n\u201cThe major oil companies and API move very much together,\u201d he said.\\nWhitehouse said the oil and gas industry now recognizes it is no longer \u201csocially acceptable\u201d to outright deny climate change, and that companies are under pressure to claim they support new energy solutions that are less harmful to the environment. But that does not mean their claims should be taken at face value.\\n\u201cThe question as to whether they\u2019re even sincere about that, or whether this is just \u2018Climate is a hoax 2.0\u2019, is an unknown at this point,\u201d he added.\\nShell has defended its funding by saying that while it is \u201cmisaligned\u201d with some of API\u2019s policies, the company continues to sit on the group\u2019s board and executive committee in order to have \u201ca greater positive impact\u201d from within. The petroleum firm claims that its influence helped manoeuvre API, which represents about 600 drilling companies, refiners and other interests such as plastics makers, toward finally supporting a tax on carbon earlier this year.\\nWith Biden in the White House and growing public awareness of global heating, there are signs API\u2019s influence may be weakening as its own members become divided on how to respond.\\nThe French oil company Total quit the group earlier this year over its climate policies. Shareholder rebellions are pressing Exxon and Chevron to move away from dependence on oil. Top clean energy executives at Shell quit in December over the pace of change by the company.\\nAPI is also fighting a growing number of lawsuits, led by the state of Minnesota, alleging that the trade group was at the heart of a decades-long \u201cdisinformation campaign\u201d on behalf of big oil to deny the threat from fossil fuels.\\nBut despite threats to API\u2019s lasting influence, Whitehouse argues the trade organization represents the true face of the industry. Instead of using its considerable power to push for environmentally friendly energy laws, API is still lobbying to stall progress with the oil industry\u2019s blessing.\\n\u201cTheir political effort at this point is purely negative, purely against serious climate legislation. And many of them continue to fund the fraudulent climate denialists that have been their mouthpieces for a decade or more,\u201d Whitehouse said.\\nSince API was founded in 1919 out of an oil industry cooperation with the government during the first world war, it has evolved into a major political force with nearly $240m in annual revenue.\\nIts board has been dominated by heavyweights from big oil, such as Rex Tillerson, the Exxon chief who went on to become Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state, and Tofiq Al Gabsani, the chief of Saudi Refining, a subsidiary of the giant state-owned Aramco oil giant. Al Gabsani was also registered as a lobbyist for the Saudi government.\\nAPI also hired professional lobbyists, including Philip Cooney, who went on to serve under George W Bush as chief of staff of the Council on Environmental Quality until he was forced to resign in 2005 after tampering with government climate assessments to downplay scientific evidence of global heating and to emphasise doubts. Shortly afterward, Cooney was hired by Exxon.\\nAPI came into its own as the realities of the climate crisis crept into public and political discourse, and the industry found itself on the defensive. The trade group, which claimed to represent companies supporting 10m jobs and nearly 8% of the US economy, played a central role in efforts to combat new environmental regulations.\\nIn many cases, API was prepared to carry out the dirty work that individual companies did not want to be held responsible for. In 1998, after countries signed the Kyoto Protocol to help curb carbon emissions, API drew up a multimillion-dollar disinformation campaign to ensure that \u201cclimate change becomes a non-issue\u201d. The plan said \u201cvictory will be achieved\u201d when \u201crecognition of uncertainties become part of the \u2018conventional wisdom\u2019\u201d.\\nMuch of this is the basis of several lawsuits against API. The first was filed last year by the Minnesota attorney general, Keith Ellison, who accuses the group of working alongside ExxonMobil and Koch Industries to lie about the scale of the climate crisis. The suit alleges that \u201cpreviously unknown internal documents\u201d show that API and the others well understood the dangers for decades but \u201cengaged in a public-relations campaign that was not only false, but also highly effective\u201d to undermine climate science.\\nThe city of Hoboken in New Jersey is also suing API, claiming that it engaged in a conspiracy by joining and funding \u201cfront groups\u201d that ran \u201cdeceptive advertising and communications campaigns that promote climate disinformation and denialism\u201d.\\nThe lawsuits allege that API funded scientists known to deny or underplay climate changes, and gave millions of dollars to ostensibly independent organisations, such as the Cato Institute and the George C Marshall Institute, which denied or downplayed the growing environmental crisis.\\n\u201cAPI has been a member of at least five organizations that have promoted disinformation about fossil-fuel products to consumers,\u201d Ellison alleges in Minnesota\u2019s lawsuit. \u201cThese front groups were formed to provide climate disinformation and advocacy from a seemingly objective source, when, in fact, they were financed and controlled by ExxonMobil and other sellers of fossil-fuel products.\u201d\\nIt wasn\u2019t always this way.\\nWhen Terry Yosie joined API in 1988 as vice-president for health and environment, the trade group had spent years funding scientists to research climate issues after hearing repeated warnings. In 1979, API and its members formed the Climate and Energy Task Force of oil and gas company scientists to share research.\\nYosie, who moved to API from the Environmental Protection Agency, controlled a $15m budget, part of which he used to give workshops on climate change by EPA officials and other specialists.\\n\u201cI brought them together in front of oil industry senior level executives for the sole purpose of making sure this industry had some understanding as to what other significant stakeholders thought about climate change, where they saw the issue evolving, what information they were relying on,\u201d he said.\\nWhen Yosie left API in 1992, he believed oil the lobby group was still serious about addressing the growing evidence of climate change. But a year later, it disbanded the task force at the same time that Exxon abandoned one of the industry\u2019s biggest research programmes to measure climate change.\\nYosie believes that confronted with the true extent of the looming disaster, API and the oil companies ran scared, choosing instead to pursue an agenda informed by climate denialism.\\n\u201cAs the climate issue began to move from the periphery to the centre stage, I think there was a collective loss of confidence in the entire industry, a fear that this was not a debate that was winnable,\u201d he said.\\nAPI and its financial backers founded a front organisation, the deceptively named Global Climate Coalition, to drum up purported evidence that the climate crisis was a hoax. In the late 1990s, the GCC\u2019s chairman, William O\u2019Keefe, was also API\u2019s executive vice-president, a man who falsely claimed that \u201cclimate scientists don\u2019t say that burning oil, gas and coal is steadily warming the earth\u201d.\\nAPI and the GCC led attacks on Bill Clinton\u2019s support for the Kyoto protocol with a \u201cglobal climate science communications plan\u201d that misrepresented the facts about global heating.\\nThe relationship between API and big oil remained exceptionally close throughout. Exxon\u2019s chief executive served on the lobby group\u2019s executive committee for most of the past three decades, and the two worked together in promoting denialism over the climate crisis.\\nThe focus of API\u2019s efforts were on Congress, where it led the industry\u2019s opposition to policies, such as the 2009 cap-and-trade legislation to control carbon emissions.\\n\u201cMost of the funding for the Republican party, and probably a very considerable amount of the big dark money funding behind the Republican party, comes out of the fossil fuel industry,\u201d said Whitehouse. Last year, API indirectly gave $5m to the conservative Senate Leadership Fund to back Republican election candidates (many of whom question climate science), and to the campaigns of members of the energy committees in both houses of Congress.\\nGrowing public disquiet, and the departure of oil-friendly Donald Trump from the White House, shifted the ground for API. In March it launched a Climate Action Framework, which for the first time endorsed policies such as carbon pricing. It also stated its support for the Paris climate agreement.\\nAPI called the plan \u201crobust\u201d but others noted the lack of specifics and its sincerity was called into question when an Exxon lobbyist was caught on camera earlier this year saying that a carbon tax will never happen and that support for the measure was a public relations ploy intended to stall more serious measures.\\nAnd between API\u2019s lost support from Total, and the Shell executives who resigned in December over what they regarded as the company\u2019s foot-dragging on greener fuels, there are signs of shifting attitudes within the industry itself.\\nShell and BP have said they will continue to review their support for API. Shell said that where it disagrees with API\u2019s position, the company \u201cwill pursue advocacy separately\u201d.\\nHowever, Peter Frumhoff, director of science and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, is sceptical that there has been any significant change in direction.\\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that API and its prominent member companies have have a broadly shared goal, which is to keep the social licence of the oil and gas industry operating, and therefore enabling them to continue to extract oil and gas for as long as possible, as profitably as possible,\u201d he said.\\nThis story is published as part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of news outlets strengthening coverage of the climate story", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5fc1613b06a31a5b777664079bb75a45bbb86c0/0_98_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "An ad paid for by API as part of its Energy For Progress campaign to cast natural gas as climate-friendly.

If governments acquire political weapons unavailable to their opponents, they become harder to dislodge. They now possess so many that I begin to wonder how an efficient autocracy, once established, might ever again be overthrown.\\nThe Pegasus spyware, whose widespread use by governments the Guardian has helped reveal, is just the latest variety of asymmetric force. The ability to peer into someone\u2019s life from a distance, to track their every movement, word and intention, grants autocrats an unprecedented power. It turns us into informants against ourselves. No one subject to this spying can now plan, however peacefully and democratically, to replace a government without those plans being known in advance and in all likelihood thwarted.\\nSince the Berlin Wall came down, autocrats have refined a new strategy for perpetual governance: to maintain the process and appearance of democracy \u2013 including elections and parliaments \u2013 while ensuring it doesn\u2019t work. Power is sucked out of democratic structures and relocated to a place where it can scarcely be challenged: an inner circle defended from opposition by a forcefield of money and patronage, a compliant judiciary and a grovelling media. Narendra Modi, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko all know how it works.\\nProtest, as we have seen from Belarus to Hong Kong, often becomes ineffective. Huge numbers take to the streets, pull the lever of democratic moral authority that has toppled so many regimes in the past, and nothing happens. The autocrats sit and wait for the protest\u2019s energy to fizzle out, crack heads and imprison leaders, knowing they no longer need fear the people. They now have the means either to win elections through rigging, suppression or beguilement, or to ignore the result if they lose. The arc of history no longer bends towards justice.\\nThe new surveillance tools complement a formidable array of modern weapons. Dark ads on social media; thinktanks using dark money to turn outrageous ideas that favour the ruling class into apparent common sense; voter suppression; the stuffing of the courts; the long march through the institutions, shutting down opposition in the civic sphere; cleverly prosecuted culture wars: these are the ever more sophisticated tools of autocratic power in nominal democracies.\\nMany of them are being deployed in the UK. While there is no evidence that the government has been using Pegasus spyware, we have seen ever greater snooping on citizens, from the surveillance networks developed by the government intelligence agency GCHQ and exposed by Edward Snowden to the undercover police deployed against peaceful protesters, some of whom they deceived into sexual relationships. The cops promised, as revelations from this scandal piled up, to reform themselves. But last week, a former police officer who joined Extinction Rebellion alleged that the Metropolitan police had sought to recruit him as a spy. Given the characterisation by Priti Patel, the home secretary, of peaceful environmental protesters as \u201ccriminals\u201d, I would find it surprising if police spying had not resumed.\\nThe government is turning politics into a one-way mirror. Just as it learns more about our lives, it ensures we learn ever less about its own machinations. Its proposed changes to the Official Secrets Act would treat journalists and other citizens making \u201cunauthorised disclosures\u201d as if they were spies, threatening them with \u201cincreased maximum sentences\u201d, which probably means 14 years. It has so far resisted calls for a public interest defence. But unauthorised disclosures of government malfeasance are essential to democracy. While illegitimate scrutiny is ramped up, legitimate scrutiny is stifled.\\nFor the past 35 years, our political freedoms have been eroded by a series of draconian acts of parliament, imposed by both Conservative and Labour governments: the Public Order Act 1986, the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1992, the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, the Terrorism Act 2000, the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003, the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, the Transparency of Lobbying, Non-Party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Act 2014, the Trade Union Act 2016, the Covert Human Intelligence Sources Act 2021, to name just a few. But none has gone as far as the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill that has now passed unamended through the House of Commons. It grants the police powers to shut down protests on grounds defined so vaguely \u2013 including causing \u201cserious unease\u201d to bystanders \u2013 that they could apply to any public expression of dissent. Serious unease is the motor of democracy. When and how do we recover these lost political liberties?\\nThe demand for proof of identity at polling booths is a blatant attempt at voter suppression, of the kind pioneered by US Republicans. To solve a nonexistent problem (widespread identity fraud at elections), it could disqualify 2 million people, generally the poorest and most marginalised, who are unlikely to vote Conservative, from casting their ballots.\\nThe government has floated the idea of disbanding the Electoral Commission, stripping away the last, feeble controls on how it conducts elections and raises money. Its judicial review and courts bill will limit our ability to challenge its decisions. As recent cases involving environmentally damaging projects and Covid contracts show, legal challenges are essential to hold it to account. It has used culture wars to try to stamp out criticism in universities and other public institutions, and combined with the billionaire press to demonise anyone confronting the interests from which it draws its power, often to devastating effect.\\nThe government\u2019s only remaining weakness is its own incompetence. Donald Trump is no longer in office not because the US system worked, but because he was an inept autocrat: unfocused, impulsive, contradictory. He did not possess what Modi, Putin, Orb\u00e1n, Erdo\u011fan, Kaczy\u0144ski and Lukashenko possess: a strategic, sophisticated drive for power.\\nBoris Johnson is a spectacularly incompetent administrator, as the 130,000 deaths from Covid-19 testify. It remains to be seen whether or not he is a competent autocrat. He has certainly been more effective at suppressing opposition than at governing the country. Through lucrative pandemic contracts for court favourites and assaults on the planning laws that favour property tycoons, his government has also started to build the networks of patronage and clientelism essential to all autocracies. Perhaps Johnson\u2019s general uselessness will prove fatal.

Taking her name for a riff on James Lovelock\u2019s earth-as-an-organism Gaia hypothesis, he remarked: \u201cGaya \u2013 that\u2019s not a name, it\u2019s responsibility.\u201d\\nHerrington, a Dutch sustainability researcher and adviser to the Club of Rome, a Swiss thinktank, has made headlines in recent days after she authored a report that appeared to show a controversial 1970s study predicting the collapse of civilization was \u2013 apparently \u2013 right on time.\\nComing amid a cascade of alarming environmental events, from western US and Siberian wildfires to German floods and a report that suggests the Amazon rainforest may no longer be able to perform as a carbon sink, Herrington\u2019s work predicted the collapse could come around 2040 if current trends held.\\nResearch by Herrington, a rising star in efforts to place data analysis at the center of efforts to curb climate breakdown, affirmed the bleaker scenarios put forward in a landmark 1972 MIT study, The Limits to Growth, that presented various outcomes for what could happen when the growth of industrial civilization collided with finite resources.\\nNow, with the climate crisis increasing the frequency of extreme weather events, and many single events shown to have been made worse by global heating, the Club of Rome, publisher of original MIT paper, has returned to the study.\\n\u201cFrom a research perspective, I felt a data check of a decades-old model against empirical observations would be an interesting exercise,\u201d said Herrington, a sustainability analyst at the accounting giant KPMG that recently described greenhouse gas emissions as a \u201cshared, existential challenge.\u201d\\n\u201cThe MIT scientists said we needed to act now to achieve a smooth transition and avoid costs,\u201d Herrington told the Guardian this week. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen, so we\u2019re seeing the impact of climate change.\u201d\\nSince its publication, The Limits to Growth has sold upwards of 30m copies. It was published just four years after Paul Ehrlich\u2019s Population Bomb that forewarned of an imminent population collapse. With MIT offering analysis and the other full of doom-laden predictions, both helped to fuel the era\u2019s environmental movements, from Greenpeace to Earth First!.\\nHerrington, 39, says she undertook the update (available on the KPMG website and credited to its publisher, the Yale Journal of Industrial Ecology) independently \u201cout of pure curiosity about data accuracy\u201d. Her findings were bleak: current data aligns well with the 1970s analysis that showed economic growth could end at the end of the current decade and collapse come about 10 years later (in worst case scenarios).\\nThe timing of Herrington\u2019s paper, as world economies grapple with the impact of the pandemic, is highly prescient as governments largely look to return economies to business-as-usual growth, despite loud warnings that continuing economic growth is incompatible with sustainability.\\nEarlier this year, in a paper titled Beyond Growth, the analyst wrote plainly: \u201cAmidst global slowdown and risks of depressed future growth potential from climate change, social unrest, and geopolitical instability, to name a few, responsible leaders face the possibility that growth will be limited in the future. And only a fool keeps chasing an impossibility.\u201d\\nHerrington, who has a degree in econometrics from the University of Amsterdam and a master\u2019s in sustainability from Harvard, believes that the field of economic sustainability has to be made into an observable science that can be acted upon.\\nHer motivation, she says, is for the wellbeing of future generations. \u201cI would like \u2018the kids to be OK\u2019, even if none of them were mine,\u201d she says. \u201cI am driven by a passion for sustainability. Always have been.\u201d\\nThe policy officer who approached her at the UN meeting and spoke about the meaning and responsibility of her first name was not necessarily wrong, she adds. \u201cHe was right in the sense that my drive has always come naturally to me.\u201d\\nThe MIT study, Herrington says, was never about making predictions but to show potential paths forward during a time of immense change. Herrington\u2019s review concludes that the 1972 study was essentially on target. The 1972 study\u2019s authors, Herrington points out, were looking for paths toward a stabilized world in terms of economic growth.\\nShe says there is nothing inevitable about its predictions \u2013 even now.\\n\u201cThe key finding of my study is that we still have a choice to align with a scenario that does not end in collapse. With innovation in business, along with new developments by governments and civil society, continuing to update the model provides another perspective on the challenges and opportunities we have to create a more sustainable world.\u201d\\nAt the same time, she says, the primary concerns of the MIT study have been supplanted. \u201cResource scarcity has not been the challenge people thought it would be in the 70s and population growth has not been the scare it was in the 90s. Now the concern is pollution and how it perfectly aligned with what climate scientists are saying,\u201d she said.\\nTechnological advances have meant simply that we go farther and deeper to extract fossil fuels, and despite some efficiencies, consumption and emissions have only increased. The MIT authors, she points out, predicted as much.\\n\u201cThey said that even if we innovate ourselves out of resource scarcity, we would probably see an increase in pollution from those adaptations unless we also limit our continued search for growth,\u201d she said.\\nIn the new study, Herrington focused on two scenarios using a range of variables, or markers, including population, fertility rates, mortality rates, industrial output, food production, services, non-renewable resources, persistent pollution, human welfare, and ecological footprint.\\nUnder one, termed business as usual, or BAU2, growth would stall and combine with population collapse. The other, termed comprehensive technology (CT), modeled stalled economic growth without social collapse. Both scenarios \u201cshow a halt in growth within a decade or so from now,\u201d the study says, adding, that \u201cpursuing continuous growth, is not possible.\u201d\\nSustainability is the answer, she says.\\n\u201cThere is a sustainable way of creating value and prosperity that also has immense economic potential. Doing good can still yield a profit. In fact, we are seeing examples of that happening right now. Expanding those efforts now creates a world full of opportunity that is also sustainable,\u201d she said.\\nIronically, the pandemic, she believes, has even shown the world what might be possible.\\n\u201cWe\u2019re totally capable of making huge changes, and we\u2019ve seen with the pandemic, but we have to act now if we\u2019re to avoid costs much greater than we\u2019re seeing,\u201d she said.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51671a034ce3ac640cd40f18ef139d77fdf9bd90/0_302_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Firefighters in Weed, California rush to tackle a blaze.

Its second-quarter profits climbed to $5.5bn from $3.2bn in the same period last year, about 9% higher than forecast by City analysts.\\nVan Beurden said the company was \u201cstepping up\u201d shareholder distributions by increasing dividends and kickstarting share buybacks \u201cwhile we continue to invest for the future of energy\u201d. \u201cWe wanted to be really clear and signal to the market the confidence that we have in our prospects and our cashflows,\u201d he said.\\nDespite the shareholder sweetener, Shell\u2019s share price remains well below where it traded before the outbreak of Covid-19, even as oil prices have recovered to pre-pandemic levels.

Scientists warn that unless global greenhouse gas emissions are halved in the next decade, temperatures will rise by more than 1.5C and the extreme heat, droughts and floods seen in recent weeks will rapidly become the norm rather than the exception, with devastating consequences.\\nJohn Kerry, the special envoy for climate to the US president, Joe Biden, warned in a landmark speech at Kew Gardens this week: \u201cCop26 in Glasgow [is] a pivotal moment for the world to come together to meet and master the climate challenge \u2026 in little more than 100 days, we can save the next hundred years.\u201d\\nAlok Sharma, the UK minister who will serve as president of the summit, said: \u201cCop26 is our last best hope of avoiding the worst effects of climate change, and we cannot afford to fail. Over the next 100 days, we need all governments to accelerate the green transition, so that we leave Glasgow with a clear plan to limit global warming to 1.5C. This will set the course of this decisive decade for our planet and future generations.\u201d\\nBut as Sharma prepares for a key meeting of world ministers this weekend, and as the US steps up its diplomacy before Cop26, climate experts and veterans of the UN talks told the Guardian that Johnson was failing to take the reins, both internationally and at home.\\n\u201cWe ask ourselves every day \u2013 where is the prime minister?\u201d said Chris Venables of the Green Alliance thinktank. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that he has not grasped the scale of holding the biggest diplomatic event on UK soil since the second world war. This should be his No 1 priority.\u201d\\nJohnson should be cajoling and pushing heads of government around the world to forge a deal at Glasgow, but has yet to make a real mark, added Bernice Lee, a research director at the Chatham House thinktank. \u201cThis is mission-critical \u2013 we need another round of leader-level diplomacy from Johnson.\u201d\\nNo government ministers were at Kew to hear Kerry\u2019s policy intervention, in which he called on China, the world\u2019s biggest emitter, to join the US in taking stronger climate action. Ed Miliband, Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, who attended UN climate talks as environment secretary under Gordon Brown, was in the audience.\\n\u201cCop26 is in the balance,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s leadership is lacking, despite the best efforts of Alok Sharma. And we need to see much more from Rishi Sunak and [the foreign secretary] Dominic Raab. Of course, Covid-19 is going to be vital, but this should absolutely be the government\u2019s top priority.\u201d\\nThere has been important progress on Cop26 in the last six months. An increasing number of countries, including China, the EU and the US, have set targets to reach net zero emissions around mid-century. Many have also set targets on emissions for 2030, including the UK, the EU and the US.\\nOne of the big achievements of the UK presidency is to keep the Cop26 talks focused on limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures. The Paris agreement of 2015 set out two key goals: one firm commitment to holding temperature rises to \u201cwell below 2C\u201d and another aspirational goal of staying within the 1.5C threshold.\\nThat compromise was forged because some big industrialised economies, chiefly China and India, were reluctant to agree to anything less than 2C, wary of putting limits on their economic growth, while small islands and low-lying states such as the Marshall Islands and Bangladesh feared they would be overwhelmed by sea level rises if temperatures exceeded 1.5C.\\nSince then, however, a report in 2018 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world authority on climate science, found that going beyond 1.5C would be dangerous, leading to the bleaching of coral reefs, an increase in extreme weather, and widespread damage to the natural world. Many experts worry that we will overshoot 1.5C, but argue that keeping it as a goal is vital to ensure we limit the damage as far as possible.\\nKerry made it clear that he sees 1.5C as the goal, and under the UK\u2019s presidency, the G7 also agreed to target the lower limit. Kerry said: \u201cThere is still time to put a safer 1.5C future back within reach. But only if every major economy commits to meaningful reductions by 2030.\u201d\\nSetting a strong target for the summit is just one step, however: ensuring a concrete programme of action comes out of Cop26 must be the main goal. Veterans of the UN talks warn that several key elements are still missing.\\nThe first is emissions-cutting targets for the next 10 years. National plans on emissions cuts, called nationally determined contributions or NDCs, are the bedrock of the Paris climate agreement. But the plans submitted so far to the UN would mean temperatures rising by more than 2C.\\nChina, the world\u2019s biggest emitter, has yet to submit an NDC. Kerry said the US wanted to work with China on a way forward. \u201cAmerica needs China to succeed in slashing emissions. China needs America to do the same. The best opportunity we have to secure a reasonable climate future is for China and the United States to work together. And the best way to do so is to lay out specific, ambitious, near-term reduction goals, and back them up with serious policy.\u201d\\nAnother big issue for Cop26 is funding. Developing countries were promised they would receive $100bn a year by 2020 in climate finance, to help them cut emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown. That target has not yet been met, and failing to meet it is eroding trust among developing countries.\\n\u201cThe US is not pulling its weight \u2013 it\u2019s the only country holding up the $100bn pledge,\u201d said John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK. \u201cIf the US does not put its hands in its pockets and make up the shortfall, Glasgow will be in jeopardy.\u201d\\nKerry told the Guardian in response that the Biden administration was \u201cworking hard\u201d on finding more financial assistance for poor countries. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that the US should provide finance. Our internal process on this is not complete yet.\u201d\\nHe added: \u201cWe are very conscious of the sensitivities around this. The US obviously plays a key role, and our absence in the last four years [from climate action] heightens that sense of responsibility and the imperative to find a way.\u201d\\nCop26 diplomacy is intensifying. Ministers from the G20 countries are meeting on Thursday and Friday in Naples to discuss climate action, and on Sunday and Monday ministers from 40 countries will be gathered by Sharma to discuss Cop26.\\nWhile ministers meet to hammer out details, the warnings are growing louder. The International Energy Agency forecast this week that the world\u2019s annual carbon output would reach record levels in 2023, on current trends, because governments are failing to pursue green energy. Emissions at that level would put the 1.5C goal all but out of reach.\\nNext month, the IPCC is expected to come out with the first part of a new scientific assessment warning that our emissions could already be triggering tipping points in the climate system that could make global heating irreversible. That makes staying within 1.5C even more critical.\\nRachel Kyte, the dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University in the US, and a former high-ranking World Bank official at the UN talks, said the UK government, and Boris Johnson, must step up urgently. \u201cWe\u2019re into extra time, and with 100 days to go we\u2019re not \u2013 by any means \u2013 where we would want to be in the negotiating process,\u201d she said. \u201cThe minimum we need to see now is some aggressive diplomacy around the world for big emitters to come up with much bolder action.\u201d", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21268cd0dcb1a5a51090c949560083c8c864b701/0_0_5226_3138/master/5226.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "The aftermath of flooding on the Ahr River, in the district of Ahrweiler, Germany, after extreme weather this month."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d459bd72cb78d7d5d00c394bd0236c94a1118a88/0_0_8640_5184/master/8640.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "The US special presidential envoy for climate, John Kerry, gives a speech at Kew, London, on 20 July."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b18efd56a40cc61bf121ae81443cd6feadae9187/0_321_3400_2041/master/3400.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "A coal-burning power plant behind a factory in China\u2019s Inner Mongolia autonomous region."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab795de44de66e7ea035181d3546695df9949c72/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Protesters demand climate action as G20 ministers meet in Naples."]], "author": ["Fiona Harvey"], "date": "2021-07-23"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/jul/17/do-i-look-cheugy-in-this-what-can-a-gen-z-makeover-teach-me-about-life": {"title": "Do I look cheugy in this?

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\\nI am sitting cross-legged on the floor, wearing a bucket hat, trying to be chill. I rest my chin in my hands and try to think chill thoughts, which is hard, because I am wearing mint flatform Crocs, studded with pineapples and watermelons, and a fluffy green knit that feels more like a pet than a cardigan. But I do my best, because being chill is essential if I am to get into character.\\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\\nThe term \u201cchill\u201d has come up a lot during this past week in which I \u2013 one of the world\u2019s oldest millennials at 39 \u2013 am trying to be more generation Z. I\u2019m learning the ways of the generation beneath mine, who, according to the US thinktank the Pew Research Center, were born between 1997 and 2012, and are taking over from millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) as the cohort in charge of the internet.\\nAs a fashion editor, I\u2019ve spent the past eight years with my trend-detecting antenna on. I\u2019ve chased Katy Perry fans across fields at Glastonbury to pose the big questions \u2013 why bumbags, why now? \u2013 and run backstage to ask designers why they were feeling palazzo pants this season.\\nRecently, however, I\u2019ve noticed that all trends seem to point to generation Z, from the rise of secondhand clothes shopping app Depop, recently acquired by Etsy for \u00a31bn, to the dominance of TikTok, which has about 1.1 billion active users, and estimates that 60% of its US users are aged between 16 and 24. Millennials \u2013 once a byword for popular culture and youth \u2013 are barely getting a look-in.\\nThis passing of the baton hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by generation Zers. Instead, they have been mercilessly skewering pass\u00e9 millennial taste in viral posts online. They have been slamming Live, Laugh, Love slogans on merchandise; skinny jeans; crying-while-laughing emojis; and side-parted hair \u2013 the very hair that is on my head. They have been calling such things \u201ccheugy\u201d, the new word for basic, a term I was until recently too cheugy to know. I almost spat out my avocado on toast when I read about it on Twitter.\\nThis may seem an unlikely battle at first. Aren\u2019t generation gaps supposed to be about kids pushing back against the lives of their parents? Instead, this is about two rival cohorts, more closely matched in age, jostling for supremacy in the noisy public sphere of social media.\\nIt is also about slating millennials, which \u2013 poor us \u2013 is nothing new. We are, remember, entitled, narcissistic and fame-obsessed, owing to the deadly combination of doting parents, reality TV and social media. Like Hannah Horvath in Lena Dunham\u2019s Girls (Hannah is a very millennial name), we\u2019re constantly whining, because our early adult years \u2013 dented by the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 have not lived up to the expectations we formed as we grew up bingeing Sex And The City.\\nThe received wisdom about generation Z, on the other hand, is that they are a force for good. They are Greta Thunberg (born in 2003), Billie Eilish (2001) and Malala Yousafzai (1997). They use social media not to post selfies, but to mobilise. They pole-vaulted the climate crisis up the news agenda with their school strikes. They drink less and even have fewer unplanned pregnancies.\\nWhat could I learn from them? I recruited a panel to advise me on how to dress \u2013 and live \u2013 a bit more like them.\\n\u201cThere is definitely a feeling among my peers that the world is going to end,\u201d says my first panellist, creative director and consultant Lula Ososki, with what I come to recognise as a classic gen-Z combination of bleakness and optimism. \u201cThat sounds really sombre, but part of having that feeling means wanting to do positive things, to go out there and protest and make the world better.\u201d\\nOsoski is, at 24, a bit ancient \u2013 technically three months over the generation-Z threshold \u2013 but she works with \u201cgen-Z thinktank\u201d Irregular Labs, so is perfectly placed to break it down for me, anthropologically.\\nShe thinks generation Z are more likely to have \u201ca distrust of existing systems, whether work or education, and a sense that we don\u2019t need institutions\u201d, having come of age in the era of Trump and \u201cfake news\u201d. Ososki did not go to university, but taught herself coding and Photoshop using YouTube, forums and blogs. She sees many of her friends doing the same, and believes that, after the past year\u2019s Covid-enforced home schooling, the number of generation Zers self-educating will only increase.\\n\u201cWe\u2019re comfortable with this unstable, crazy world,\u201d she continues, \u201cand with growing up on social media, where you\u2019re seeing everything all the time.\u201d Generation Z \u2013 the oldest of whom was 10 when the iPhone was launched \u2013 are social media virtuosos, whereas we millennials had to learn on the job. She sees a tendency to \u201cthink fluidly about everything\u201d: not just about gender, but about work and social media. For example, on Instagram many of her peers also have a \u201cFinsta\u201d (a fake account) for close friends, as well as their main feed. \u201cIt\u2019s an explicit push against the algorithms \u2013 kind of about having multiple versions of yourself, rather than one linear, polished version.\u201d\\nMya-Rose Craig, 19, is another impressive generation Z voice who, like most of my interviewees, has an excellent centre parting. Craig started a blog \u2013 as Birdgirl \u2013 at 11 years old and, at 14, launched a charity called Black2Nature, giving mainly ethnic-minority, inner-city children access to the countryside. Her book, We Have A Dream, highlighting young BIPOC (black, Indigenous and people of colour) environmentalists from around the world, comes out on 5 August. She does a lot of campaigning about climate change and says: \u201cAs I got older, there was less of a feeling of \u2018this is going to get sorted out\u2019, so, like many my age, I decided I was going to take it upon myself to make it very clear that this is an issue my generation cares about.\u201d\\nSerena Brown, 23, is a rising photography star; she took the pictures for this article. She also wants to be a force for good. \u201cI always want to make work that feels like it is making a change,\u201d she says of her photographs, which celebrate the beauty in a varied range of body shapes and ethnicities.\\nIzzy Keane, 24, is a campaigner and co-founder of Izzy Wheels, a company that makes colourful, fashion-inspired wheelchair accessories. She believes that generation Z is particularly progressive and inclusive. \u201cMy generation is really known for breaking down barriers,\u201d she says, flagging the high participation of young people in the marriage equality referendum in Ireland as one example. \u201cSo much has happened within the time that we have been aware citizens, good and bad. It makes us think about things and realise that we have a part to play in making them better.\u201d In her own work and life, she says, \u201cIn all honesty I find it very easy to speak about my disability to gen Z people because I don\u2019t expect them to have preconceived notions about it, and that\u2019s such a comfort.\u201d\\nThey all have their own theories about what divides the warring generations. Millennials, suggests Ososki, tend to find \u201cmore of a comfort in things that are slightly performative. Of doing things for show, rather than because you give a shit \u2013 a sense of \u2018I\u2019m wearing pink for the Women\u2019s March!\u2019\u201d She cites Kendall Jenner (a millennial, just, born in 1995) and her much-criticised 2017 Pepsi ad, which was accused of co-opting protest movements, as the classic example.\\nCraig, meanwhile, perceives millennials as less politicised, which she believes stems from the insecurity engendered by the 2008 stock market crash. \u201cAll the millennials I know are super hardworking, whereas a lot of generation Z want really radical change and are questioning why we are supposed to be dreaming of work and labour in the first place.\u201d\\nBrown says some millennials can be a bit old-fashioned. \u201cThey don\u2019t really pick up on how society has progressed,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit sad, to see conversations that go on between generations about mental health.\u201d Millennials calling generation Z \u201csnowflakes\u201d is really not fair, she points out, given that the younger group are the first generation who \u2013 thanks to constant connectivity \u2013 have had to absorb \u201call the awful things happening all the time. You can end up super depressed and miserable.\u201d\\nIt\u2019s funny to hear generation Zers talk about millennials as being cliched and apathetic, though, sadly, the more I hear of it, the more I feel a bit seen. I didn\u2019t think of myself as a stereotypical millennial \u2013 not least because I\u2019m on the cusp of generation X and, like many women my age, no longer youthful and carefree, but harried, being both an unpaid carer and a mother of two. But some of the criticism chimes.\\nFor example, I think of myself as someone who doesn\u2019t really wear trends. I have cultivated a look, heavy on jumpers and straight-leg jeans, that I hope I won\u2019t update often, for reasons of bandwidth, ethics and budget. But there are things I own that exactly reflect the look so disdained by generation Z: skinny jeans, of course, and tops with quotes on them (mine says I Woke Up Like This.) Also, I am not a big selfie-taker, but I have found myself doing Instagrammy things like going to brunch, absent-mindedly moving the salt and pepper pots into a pleasing configuration and posting a picture of them.\\nFinally, I consider myself to be somewhat politically engaged, and hope I am ethical and inclusive in work and day-to-day life. But during the past 12 months, I haven\u2019t been on a march, or even to the refill shop, or written to my MP about anything. Experimenting with generation Z life for a bit could be what I need to jolt me out of my programming.\\nBrown tells me that TikTok is essential to the authentic generation Z experience. \u201cI know that on there I\u2019ll actually be happy and laugh. It\u2019s a more lighthearted and, for me, less intense place to be,\u201d she says. On Instagram she can fall into the trap of comparing herself with others. \u201cI hope we are coming to the end of that, to be honest,\u201d she says. \u201cIncreasingly it has only become useful when you\u2019re selling or promoting something.\u201d\\nWhen I download TikTok, I miss Instagram\u2019s gloss. In fact, TikTok appalls me at first, presenting videos of crashed cars and people swearing beneath grey English skies, or washing their sofa cushions. I am urged to follow Paul Chuckle and Gary Barlow. But you need to like and watch videos for TikTok\u2019s algorithms to learn your taste.\\nWithin two days the app cottons on, and my feed becomes a diverse mixture of Taiwanese food hacks, Texan grandmas giving life advice, and clips of Olivia Colman. Soon it becomes too absorbing, stealing hours from me, as though I have attached my brain directly to a portal. I keep going back, in the evenings after the kids are asleep, and staying up later than I should. This, I am told, is all standard gen-Z behaviour.\n ***\\nI try to adopt their tone online: a surreal sort of gallows humour, which my panel tell me can be necessary, because being generation Z can feel like a bit much, with the rolling ticker-tape of bad news scrolling before their eyes.\\nI set up a Finsta, to which I invite six friends. It is liberating at first. With no professional contacts looking over my shoulder, I post a slightly rude joke and an embarrassing childhood picture. The paucity of likes suggests that I have confused my mates. Either that, or my attempt to rebel against Instagram\u2019s algorithms by not following my friends back has rendered me invisible.\\nI try to be more idiosyncratic with my emojis, too, following my panel\u2019s lead. (Brown favours the heart on fire and a certain kind of twisted face which will \u201csoften the blow when I am saying something a bit rogue\u201d, while Craig is a fan of the skull and the side eye.) I throw a few arbitrary puffer fish into my WhatsApp chats, leaving my friends truly baffled.\\nInspired by my interviewees, I think about how I could do a bit more good in the world. I go into activist mode: I write to my MP regarding the Cop26 climate conference and about social care, and to Primark and & Other Stories about installing repair stations. I donate to Greenpeace. And then I go back on TikTok, because I am addicted now, and watch a video of someone doing a pencil drawing of a tiger.\\nFinally, I try some of the TikTok food hacks that have intrigued me. I make Cloud Bread, a meringue-like fluff which tastes of nothing, and decide I don\u2019t have time for these kinds of japes. I am happier making cubes of iced espresso, because it at least feels useful as a hack to avoid watery bits at the end of an iced coffee.\\nWhen I go back to Instagram, it feels stilted, its carefully constructed images like something from a corporate brochure. The platform is notoriously homogenous, after all: accounts like @insta_repeat chronicle how certain types of images \u2013 from latte art to hotdog legs to brunch \u2013 have become cliches.\\nFashion has been Instagrammed, too. Ososki says that part of the reason generation Z are slating skinny jeans is \u201cpushing against all of this Kim Kardashian formulaic algorithm stuff\u201d.\\nAll of my panel speak about individuality as a central tenet of the gen-Z life. This goes way beyond style, says Craig. \u201cI remember, when I was little, people saying, \u2018You\u2019re going to get peer pressured into doing drugs.\u2019 But I know lots of people my age who don\u2019t drink even when they go to parties, and it\u2019s just fine. People just don\u2019t care,\u201d she says, which is one reason, she thinks, that generation Z are described as being more clean-living than their predecessors.\\nOsoski tells me that generation Z have grown up wary of \u201ctop down\u201d trends. They \u201cfind their own trends or multiple trends at once, and mash them together\u201d. This coalesces on \u2013 where else? \u2013 TikTok. This approach to fashion provides a fountain of surprises, creativity and weirdness, throwing up wry, eye-catching, era-splicing looks with excellent names, ranging from Dark Academia (key references: Donna Tartt and Giles from Buffy) to cottagecore (gingham, crochet and ruffles).\\nFor my generation Z glow up, the Guardian\u2019s genius stylist, Peter Bevan (born in 1994), tries to crystallise the difference between the two generations by doubling down on the archetypes. For the \u201cbefore\u201d (ie millennial) look, that means a side parting (AKA my actual hair), an iced latte, a motivational slogan T-shirt and a millennial-pink shorts-suit. I feel like it\u2019s 2014 and I\u2019m about to stride into a Silicon Valley meeting to pitch an app that will monetise periods.\\nThe generation Z clothes, meanwhile, leave me dizzy with nostalgia, from the tiny lozenge-shaped handbag of the Fendi Baguette-inspired kind I used to own in sixth form, to some very Matrix-y narrow sunglasses, a key staple of the gen-Z-driven Y2K trend. The baggy black raver trousers and slim-fit orange vest layered over a long-sleeved mesh top is my favourite look, and feels like a more stylish version of something I would have worn in my teens, during the 90s, perhaps while vomiting behind a speaker.\\nGen-Z makeup also combines eras and moods: 1970s Divine-esque eyeliner with overlined 1990s lips. I like my centre parting a lot, even if I suspect the reason generation Zers love theirs so much is because it makes them look different from us. I try to keep it in place after the shoot, but overnight my hair reverts to the side, as though it has millennial muscle memory.\\nI ask my panel of advisers for their feedback on my looks. Brown is highly approving of the generation Z styles, particularly the Crocs \u2013 \u201csuch an important gen-Z staple\u201d. Keane likes the mint green blazer outfit, and the orange top, so she crosses the generational divide. She even concedes that she will mix her parting up, from centre to side, at times. \u201cI don\u2019t really conform to the style of the moment \u2013 I wear what I like,\u201d she says, which is very generation Z, confusingly. Craig thinks the millennial green blazer outfit \u201clooks nice, to be honest\u201d, though she\u2019s not into the pink suit. The coffee repels her, too, the idea of \u201cgrabbing a \u00a35 coffee on the way to work \u2013 I have never had a Starbucks in my life\u201d. She sounds an alarming note on the Crocs outfit: \u201cAll of those things individually are or were quite trendy, but together, the trend cycle moves so fast \u2013 I don\u2019t usually use this word, but it almost looks cheugy.\u201d\\nFor all this talk about individuality, there are still pressures: internet churn means the trend cycle is \u201cspeeding up immensely\u201d, says Craig. \u201cSometimes micro-trends come or go within a week or two, and there\u2019s a suggestion that everything is in fashion at the same time \u2013 the 2000s, 90s, 80s, 70s and 60s, which is exhausting. Even things from the very early 2010s are starting to come back.\u201d\\nWhile generation Z love Depop and secondhand clothes, they are also the key demographic for ultrafast fashion sites such as Shein, which are usually cheaper. The knotty battle between ethics and affordable self-expression is particularly fraught for internet-era teens, despite their generation\u2019s campaigning. \u201cEven wearing something from a year or two ago can feel untrendy, and people are always inventing new terms to say that, like cheugy,\u201d says Craig. She has friends who only shop secondhand, but knows plenty more who only shop ultra-fast fashion. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to get so fast that a lot of people break out of that trend cycle completely.\u201d As for her, she has started re-wearing her older sister\u2019s babydoll tops from the 00s.\\nThis disparity underlines the fact that generation Z, like millennials, contains multitudes, and that generational comparisons are wildly simplistic. Race, economic situation, class, health, ability and a multiplicity of other factors are at least as important as your birthdate in forming attitudes. Even within the same family and generation, viewpoints can be wildly different: for every Prince Harry (born in 1984) there is a Prince William (1982).\\nBut there are, undeniably, generation Z tendencies that just weren\u2019t au courant when I was coming of age in the 90s and 00s. This swap has shown me that I have been more influenced by millennial culture than I realised, and made me wonder who I would have been had I grown up 20 years later.\\nFor me, the appeal of the gen-Z lifestyle turns out not to be about the clothes, but the mindset. I have enjoyed being unashamedly more serious, thoughtful and engaged. I have felt as though I had permission to talk about issues I care about without feeling as if I am being a bummer. It feels a bit heavy to be generation Z, but it also feels brimming with possibility. And, having walked a mile in their Crocs, I can see why being chill is the state to which they aspire. They must be knackered.\\nMillennial Posting a crying-while-laughing emojiGen Z Anything else: skull, heart on fire, side-eye, something more obscure\\nMillennial Taking a selfie at a protest march and posting it to social mediaGen Z Using social media to organise protests across international borders\\nMillennial Skinny jeans and a loose topGen Z Baggy jeans and a little vest\\nMillennial Presenting your best, glossiest face on InstagramGen Z Being hilarious, honest and raw on TikTok\\nMillennial Buying clothes, mugs, stationery covered in motivational slogansGen Z Buying secondhand clothes\\nMillennial Side partingsGen Z Centre partings\\nMillennial Following big trendsGen Z Making your own micro-trend: try pastelgoth, with a pinch of Y2K and a touch of goblincore", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6425e720824d0069a8e80229ba4e409d306c0e1/0_11_3508_2105/master/3508.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Hannah Marriott dressed in Gen Z clothes"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c2a0d2093db43b105b0d5cfc71ce0bf9d791766/0_11_3508_2105/master/3508.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Hannah Marriott dressed in Gen Z clothes"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07f388b065bc0ca46dae6c9281004839eebc1f08/0_0_1412_2077/master/1412.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Lula Ososki"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/663483404bfaa822609ab76e8ae5f2a1409030cf/14_169_746_641/master/746.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Serena Brown"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1cb2f42d7dae3d21fe52a587f08f1f13d8c0460/0_13_2924_1983/master/2924.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Mya-Rose Craig"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d2f32d8fe1db2d64b8158bd10a946b6cbbf9f68/0_1870_6000_6362/master/6000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Izzy Keane, campaigner and co-founder of Izzy\u2019s Wheels"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a60d0e478e8518de2bb6275ca38c5a4b0897d469/0_965_4480_5381/master/4480.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Hannah Marriott dressed in Gen Z clothes"]], "author": ["Hannah Marriott"], "date": null}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/18/wall-of-love-the-incredible-story-behind-the-national-covid-memorial-led-by-donkeys": {"title": "Wall of love: the incredible story behind the national Covid memorial", "subtitle": null, "text": "How bereaved campaigners, with a little help from the activists Led By Donkeys, created a powerful tribute to UK pandemic victims\\nOn the morning of the day of the Euro 2020 final, Westminster Bridge is already bustling with football fans and England flags, but down by the riverside hush prevails. On the Albert Embankment, there is a wall, about a third of a mile long and shaded by plane trees, which runs alongside St Thomas\u2019 hospital and looks out over the Thames at the palace of Westminster. Before 29 March this year, it was just a wall; now it is decorated with more than 150,000 red hearts, each one representing a life lost to Covid-19. Even the Sunday runners look a little sheepish about jogging past a memorial to the UK\u2019s largest peacetime mass trauma event in more than a century.\\nAs I walk along what is in effect the national Covid memorial, past occasional photographs, wilting bouquets and painted stones, I read shattering stories told in just a few words. There\u2019s one dedication to a husband and wife who died nine hours apart and another that must have been written by a NHS worker: \u201cTO ALL THOSE I COULD NOT SIT WITH\u2026 I\u2019M SORRY.\u201d Sometimes, hearts are tied together by pen like a bunch of balloons, to encompass messages from entire families. Certain phrases recur, like mantras of remembrance. In loving memory. We will always remember you. Gone but not forgotten.\\nA national memorial to the victims of a catastrophe is usually a delicate and complex negotiation between the authorities and the families of the dead. The process is long and never without controversy. The residents of Hiroshima argued for years about whether to preserve the ruins of the city\u2019s industrial promotion hall as a peace memorial. Maya Lin\u2019s celebrated Vietnam veterans memorial in Washington DC was initially derided by opponents as an \u201copen urinal\u201d and \u201cOrwellian glop\u201d. It took a decade to select and construct Reflecting Absence, the 9/11 memorial in Manhattan. Boris Johnson has promised a commission on Covid commemoration but what form, and how long it will take, is anyone\u2019s guess.\\nThe Covid memorial wall is perhaps unique. Established by the bereaved themselves, without official permission, it has attracted nothing but praise. People outside London can request a dedication but many want to make the journey themselves. On Sunday morning, I talk to two such families. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve felt comfortable coming down here,\u201d says Anna from East Sussex, as she writes a dedication to her father, Jan Szymanski. Stacey and Karen from Essex have come to memorialise their mother, Junie Sheridan, on the six-month anniversary of her death.\\nIn a New Yorker profile of Lin, Louis Menand wrote: \u201cNow we expect a memorial will be interactive and that it will visibly move the viewer. If it doesn\u2019t make you cry, then it isn\u2019t working.\u201d The Covid memorial wall is working.\\nSo far, it has been solely attributed to Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, but the guerrilla activist group Led By Donkeys \u2013 Ben Stewart, Oliver Knowles, James Sadri and Will Rose \u2013 have chosen the eve of so-called \u201cfreedom day\u201d to reveal their crucial role in the project because they will be launching a digital wall online, featuring audio testimony from the bereaved. Best known for their anti-Brexit campaigning, the four men kept their involvement secret even from the volunteers so as to avoid any impression that the project was politically partisan. But all memorials are political on some level because people died who need not have died and someone was responsible. You cannot remember who without raising the questions of how and why. Indeed, the wall would not exist if not for a sense that the government couldn\u2019t be trusted with the task of memorialisation.\\n\u201cWe wanted to talk about who owns memory and who gets to tell this story,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cThere\u2019s that Orwell quote - \u2018Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past.\u2019 Are the government going to try to control the memory of this and are they perhaps a singularly inappropriate institution to do that, given the very serious questions about how they\u2019ve conducted it? We need to remember the scale of the loss here. If someone had said 150,000 in December 2019 you would have thought, how could Britain sustain that level of loss? And yet we did.\u201d\\nLast March, Jo Goodman moved from London to her family home in Norwich to stay with her 72-year-old father, Stuart, a retired press photographer who was about to begin cancer treatment. A week before the first lockdown, Jo begged him to miss his latest hospital appointment, but he assured her that he wouldn\u2019t be invited if it wasn\u2019t safe. \u201cHe trusted the NHS, but I think really who he was trusting was the government,\u201d Jo says. A week later, he began experiencing symptoms of Covid-19. By 2 April he was dead. The funeral attendance was limited to 10 people.\\nAfterwards, Goodman couldn\u2019t get past her anger at those who had failed to protect people such as Stuart. \u201cI felt it was wrong \u2013 almost more strongly than I felt the grief. I was really struggling.\u201d Through a friend, she spoke to a journalist. When the article was posted on Facebook, one reader commented that he, too, had lost a father and he, too, blamed the government.\\nBefore he got Covid, Matt Fowler\u2019s father, Ian, a former engineer for Jaguar Land Rover in Nuneaton, was enjoying early retirement. He was admitted to hospital on the first day of the lockdown and died on 13 April at the age of 56. \u201cAs far as I was concerned, Dad\u2019s death was preventable,\u201d says Fowler. \u201cIf we\u2019d been better prepared for Covid hitting the UK\u2019s shores, a lot of people could have been protected. I felt powerless. I was just one guy on his own. Then I came across the article about Jo\u2019s dad and told her I understood exactly where she was coming from.\u201d\\nGoodman and Fowler immediately set up a Facebook group. Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK began as a bereavement support group, but soon evolved into a campaign for an immediate public inquiry into the government\u2019s management of the pandemic, with a rapid review phase to avert similar mistakes during the inevitable second wave. They repeatedly sought a meeting with the prime minister. Nothing happened. \u201cWe realised that we were a bit out of our depth,\u201d says Goodman. \u201cWe needed to do something to be heard.\u201d Last September, they put out a call for experienced campaigners and Led By Donkeys responded.\\nStewart, Knowles, Sadri and Rose are four friends and seasoned Greenpeace campaigners in their 40s who met in a pub in Stoke Newington, north London one night in December 2018 and conceived a plan to remind the public of old tweets that the architects of Brexit would rather forget. They started by plastering a poster of an infamous David Cameron tweet on to a billboard near the pub. The image went viral on Twitter so they kept going, eventually relinquishing their anonymity in an interview with the Observer in May 2019. Funded entirely by public donations, they expanded their anti-Brexit campaign to include videos, projections and interactive art installations, but that mission ended with the Conservatives\u2019 general election victory. On 31 January 2020, the day the UK left the EU, Led By Donkeys projected a video on to the white cliffs of Dover of war veterans talking about the EU as a peace project and hoping that the UK would one day rejoin it. The group became known for exposing the hypocrisy of those in power, but that film found an elegiac new emotional register that prioritised the voices of ordinary people over the mendacity of politicians.\\nBy chance, that was also the day that the country\u2019s first two cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in York. Led By Donkeys soon put their post-Brexit plans on ice. \u201cWe didn\u2019t immediately jump at it because we didn\u2019t want to snipe for the sake of sniping,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cI wanted Boris Johnson to succeed. But what emerged very quickly was that he was approaching the pandemic with his usual boosterism and thermonuclear incompetence. We only do something if we\u2019ve got something to say, which is that the government is fucking this up.\u201d\\nLast November, Led By Donkeys worked with Goodman and Fowler on a short film of relatives telling personal stories of grief and made it hard to ignore by projecting it on to the palace of Westminster. The two groups then began talking about creating some kind of memorial that would convey both the scale of the death toll and the individuality of the victims. \u201cIt felt like people were sick of hearing about the pandemic and wanted to move on,\u201d says Goodman. \u201cThere was a sense that our loved ones were becoming a statistic. How do you show that they\u2019re people?\u201d\\nWhen the death toll hit 100,000 on 26 January, and Johnson pledged to establish a memorial only \u201cwhen we have come through this crisis\u201d, the need became more urgent. There were various suggestions \u2013 handprints, candles, ranks of shoes \u2013 but the concept of a wall of hearts was at once elegantly simple, emotionally immediate and logistically feasible. \u201cEach of those hand-painted hearts being unique and individual represents a unique and individual person who died,\u201d says Fowler. \u201cThat is a much more fitting memorial than a plaque or a statue.\u201d Goodman realised that people would want to write inside the hearts. \u201cI\u2019d want to know which heart represented my dad,\u201d she says. \u201cWe knew what people would need from it.\u201d The start date was set for Monday 29 March, when groups of six would once again be allowed to meet outdoors.\\nWhile Goodman and Fowler consulted other bereavement groups, Knowles cycled around to scout potential locations. As well as having political value, the St Thomas\u2019 wall was large enough and, for central London, relatively serene. The next challenge was finding 10,000 Posca pens, a brand favoured by street artists because of its resilience. With help from the Bristol street art gallery Upfest, the group bought every broad-nibbed red Posca pen in the country. Another task was making sure they painted enough 8cm by 8cm hearts to reflect the latest ONS death toll, which was a little over 150,000. They calculated that it would take two-and-a-half days for someone to count them all manually, so Rose found a scientist in the US who provided some image recognition software that would tally the hearts as they were painted and enable them to hit their target.\\nLed By Donkeys subscribe to the maxim that it is easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission. When they started plastering billboards two years ago, they looked professional by wearing hi-vis jackets and keeping their cool when police cars went past. \u201cOwn the space\u201d was Knowles\u2019s motto. \u201cWe learned that at Greenpeace when you do direct actions,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cIf you look like you\u2019re meant to be there, then it takes a very brave official to tell you you\u2019re not. We thought, what would it look like if it was all officially signed off?\u201d\\nLed By Donkeys staged a full-scale theatre of legitimacy, dressing the set with official-looking national Covid memorial wall plaques, sandwich boards and bouquets of flowers. The group set up a table to brief volunteers on social distancing and hand out branded tabards and masks. Fowler painted the first heart and dedicated it to his father. \u201cThe important thing was to get through the first hour,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cWe felt that the idea was so powerful that as soon as it had manifested 200 hearts, it would be unstoppable.\u201d They warned volunteers that they would be technically liable to arrest and prosecution for criminal damage but in the event their only contact with the police was an officer who was getting vaccinated in the grounds of the hospital and leaned over the wall to ask Sadri to add his neighbour\u2019s name to the memorial.\\nThe next obstacle was manpower. They soon realised that with the initial 30 volunteers the painting would take weeks, so they used media appearances by the bereaved to drive registrations on an events website. They ended up with approximately 1,500 volunteers over 10 days, working in Covid-safe groups of six in bizarrely variable conditions. \u201cSome days we were dressed like we were in the Arctic and other days we were handing out suncream,\u201d says Knowles. \u201cYou could hear people up and down the wall saying, \u2018I\u2019ve been at home crying every day but to come here and make this public statement with other bereaved families is a real catharsis.\u2019 It\u2019s a memorial built by the bereaved for the bereaved.\u201d\\nWhile the Westminster location is an implicit rebuke to politicians, the memorial itself was designed to be universal. \u201cThis is primarily a site of mourning,\u201d says Sadri. \u201cWe shared so many intimate emotional moments with so many people. Politics felt so distant.\u201d While the security guards who protected the wall during the installation are long gone, people seem to instinctively understand what is appropriate. There is some damning graffiti on an adjacent wall (\u201cTHE GOVT HAS FAILED\u201d, \u201cSunak=Fascist\u201d) but I spotted only one such message on the memorial itself.\\nOn day one, Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK emailed every MP with an invitation to come and witness the installation and talk to volunteers. Local MP Florence Eshalomi came that morning, as did the head of Lambeth council. Keir Starmer showed up in the afternoon. According to the families, no Conservative MPs materialised during the 10 days, although several did so subsequently, especially after the archbishop of Canterbury walked the wall with a rabbi and an imam on 20 April and spoke of \u201ca tidal wave of grief that has not been released\u201d.\\nJohnson finally appeared on 27 April, but he came after dark and without speaking to the families. It was the day after it was alleged that he had said that he would rather let \u201cbodies pile high in their thousands\u201d than impose a third national lockdown, which raised suspicions of an attempt at reputational rehab.\\n\u201cI am cautiously happy that he visited the wall and took it in,\u201d says Fowler, who finally has a meeting scheduled with Johnson in September. \u201cBut the way he went about it was very cynical and underhand. It felt insincere, like he\u2019d done it just to say that he\u2019d been. The reason we had invited him to come down when we were there and listen to our stories and concerns is because that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about: the people.\u201d\\nWhen I revisit the wall on a glum, rainy Monday evening to meet Fran Hall, she is already there with her pens, touching up hearts and messages that have been faded by the elements.\\nHall recently set up Friends of the Covid Memorial Wall to remove graffiti, fix weather damage and maintain the visual integrity of the project as best she can. Ideally, everybody would write only inside the hearts, she says, \u201cbut you can\u2019t control it and that\u2019s part of the beauty of it. We\u2019re a messy species, aren\u2019t we? We don\u2019t just do what we\u2019re told.\u201d\\nHall is a funeral director from Buckinghamshire. Last September, she got married to Steve, her partner of 11 years. A couple of days before the wedding, Steve had a hospital appointment regarding his prostate cancer. Hall only later realised that that was when he most likely to have contracted Covid-19 and that he had been asymptomatic when they tied the knot. He was admitted to hospital, but Hall wasn\u2019t allowed to visit him because he was immunocompromised and she had now tested positive. Three weeks after their wedding day, and one day before his 66th birthday, Steve died.\\nHer grief was a kind of madness, she says, until she came across the bereavement group. \u201cI found my tribe. I know about grief and this is like nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced. It\u2019s the isolation \u2013 not being able to spend time with people \u2013 and it\u2019s the horrendous way that people die. This group represented how I felt.\u201d\\nAs soon as she heard about the wall, she signed up for three hours on the Monday but ended up staying the whole day and then coming back every day until it was finished. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that I needed it as much as I did. I couldn\u2019t not come back. I\u2019d found a community and a purpose. It\u2019s helped to channel my grief.\u201d\\nWhen Goodman arrives, Hall is delighted. They have seen each other on TV but haven\u2019t actually met before. As we walk down the South Bank to get a cup of tea, Goodman talks about the importance of Hall\u2019s preservation work. \u201cI think because people feel our loved ones were neglected; when there\u2019s a heart there that represents them, you want to take good care of it.\u201d Goodman has seen pilgrimages made, memorial services held and friendships forged here. It has already inspired similar walls in Texas and Georgia. \u201cIt has taken on a life of its own. Now it would be very hard to see it go.\u201d\\nOn 12 June, Labour MP Dawn Butler raised the future of the wall in the Commons. Butler, who had dedicated a heart to her uncle, called it \u201can iconic, organic work of art created by bereaved families, and it should not be removed or painted over\u201d. Her Labour colleague Afzal Khan wrote a letter, signed by a cross-party alliance including Sadiq Khan, Ed Davey and Peter Bottomley, which called on the government to \u201cmake this wall of hearts a, if not the, permanent memorial to the victims of the pandemic\u201d. Stewart finds it hard to imagine that it will not remain. \u201cIt seems inconceivable to me that someone will come along one day with a sandblaster or some white paint. For some people, that heart on the wall is as important as a gravestone.\u201d\\nLegally, the fate of the wall rests in the hands of St Thomas\u2019 hospital and Lambeth council. There is talk of protecting it with plexiglass or lacquer but that would prevent new inscriptions and mean that it ceased to be a living memorial. For now, Hall is happy to keep it alive and growing. \u201cAt what point does something become an official memorial?\u201d asks Sadri. \u201cWho gets to decide that? The source of legitimacy is the families.\u201d\\nThe pandemic is something that many of us would like to forget, not least the government. The obsession with \u201cfreedom day\u201d reveals a somewhat manic desire to rush to the end of this dreadful episode in our history and move on. For the bereaved, however, any return to normality will be incomplete and any talk of forgetting might feel like a betrayal. To remember who died, and why they died, is both emotionally and politically essential.\\nEveryone who painted the memorial wall, or has inscribed a name on it, belongs to a community united by a determination to remember. To walk along it is to be reminded not only of the devastation of loss but also of the extraordinary magnitude of love. \u201cThey say grief is love with nowhere to go,\u201d says Goodman. \u201cThe wall is where it goes.\u201d\\nVisit the digital national Covid memorial wall.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e10920b8945d8356e398151194025ae1f35e13fd/0_1029_3600_3600/master/3600.jpg?width=480&dpr=1&s=none", "Red hearts painted on the national Covid memorial wall, Albert Embankment, London."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e58e6f4ff7d3ea2c7b972e4504f6ee8059d29cf7/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "A view of the memorial wall from across the Thames."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c6b3c5e28273ca8801f8568897984770b287edf/0_818_6144_3684/master/6144.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Fran Hall, Oliver Knowles, James Sadri, and and Jo Goodman"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae87b8cbf5ef38abbc654ae10d2113a41a2725f9/0_352_4615_2769/master/4615.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Jo Goodman, co-founder of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group, holds a portrait of her late father, Stuart."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ca5df2ffa246a6f321899a59c7967cf24415bac/0_261_5191_3116/master/5191.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Work beginning on the wall in March.

But Cressida Dick is confident of serving a second term as its chief\\nBeaming broadly as she faced the Prince of Wales in a gilded chamber at St James\u2019s Palace, Cressida Dick was about to achieve another career high. A police officer of 38 years, she appeared exhilarated last Wednesday when receiving a damehood in recognition of her public service.\\nBut storm clouds routinely follow the chief of Scotland Yard, and for Dick, more than most.\\nSeveral hours later, at 4.09pm, her force was pressured into releasing a statement defending its policing at Wembley after waves of ticketless supporters attempted to watch the Euro 2020 final on Sunday night.\\nAt 9.15pm came another Met update, this time naming a 16-year-old boy fatally stabbed in south London, the latest teenage homicide in a spike that is climbing towards a 13-year high.\\nFor seasoned observers of the Met, such daily highs and lows are part and parcel of life as Britain\u2019s most senior police officer. But increasingly, they are noticing something quite new: the extraordinary tenacity of the position\u2019s current incumbent.\\nAs calls for her resignation intensify following a rolling series of scandals including a bungled VIP paedophile ring inquiry, failings surrounding the murder of Sarah Everard and findings that the force is \u201cinstitutionally corrupt,\u201d the commissioner\u2019s reaction has been to ask for another four-year term.\\nFew, if any of her predecessors, would survive half of what Dick has endured. Increasingly, one question has become irresistible: how did its embattled chief become so bulletproof?\\nThe answer can be partly found within the vast officers\u2019 mess of the Met\u2019s newish headquarters by the River Thames.\\n\u201cShe\u2019s a good cop, simple as that,\u201d says Ken Marsh of the woman who successfully led Operation Trident, one of the force\u2019s grittiest jobs.\\nMarsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, which represents more than 30,000 officers, believes her leadership style quickly seduced much of the rank and file.\\n\u201cShe\u2019s not a shouter like some of her predecessors. She\u2019s calm and that helps a lot. And she\u2019s got our backs,\u201d says Marsh, a veteran of 32 years service.\\nHer approach, he said, became evident weeks after becoming commissioner, during the chaos that followed the death of Keith Palmer, an unarmed PC who was stabbed when a terrorist attacked the Palace of Westminster in March 2017.\\n\u201cWe were running around like headless chickens but the first thing she did to me was come over and ask: \u2018Ken are you looking after yourself?\u2019 She\u2019s one of the only senior officers who asks me how I am. That approach resonates among all of us,\u201d said Marsh.\\nOthers testify that her survivability might be rooted in her instinct to resist meddling in the affairs of the building 100 metres across the road from her office \u2013 the House of Commons.\\n\u201cShe appreciates politics can get very toxic very quickly. She is also not blind to the fact that some of her predecessors were badly burnt by failing to recognise that,\u201d said a Whitehall source.\\nAnother reason for Dick\u2019s ability to fight fire is her relationship with the home secretary Priti Patel, herself under pressure following bullying allegations and divisive interventions on asylum and the right to protest.\\nAt face value, Dick and Patel appear ideological bedfellows; both were horrified by the 2019 eco-protests that shut down the capital and are staunch advocates of stop and search.\\nBoth, too, have spoken out over their opposition to taking the knee, the symbol of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.\\nShabnam Chaudhri, who rose to become one of the Met\u2019s most senior female Asian officers and who knows Dick well, believes these illiberal instincts may eventually prove her undoing.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine to say [not taking the knee] but have you asked your officers? There was a lot of internal backlash from black officers and I know that because I speak to many of them. You have to show leadership but you also need to demonstrate that you\u2019re human, that you\u2019re the same,\u201d said Chaudhri.\\nFor former chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal, such dissent is made easier to surmount by the fact that the home secretary finds herself under so much scrutiny. He believes Patel has made a simple political calculation that means Dick\u2019s position is secure. \u201cThe commissioner is effectively a human shield for Patel,\u201d said Afzal. \u201cBoris Johnson did the same with [former health secretary] Matt Hancock: it\u2019s somebody else who can absorb the flak. For Patel it\u2019s 100% what she\u2019s doing with the commissioner. All of our ire can be directed at the commissioner rather than the person responsible for where the [policing] priorities are set.\u201d\\nA similar assessment may have been made by the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.\\nAlthough who gets the final say on whether to fire the commissioner can appear ambiguous, Khan\u2019s predecessor, Boris Johnson, effectively ended Ian Blair\u2019s stint as the head of the Met in 2008.\\nBut Khan, to the exasperation of many on the left, is unwilling to do the same. On Friday, Khan\u2019s office reiterated its unwavering support for Dick, saying it looked \u201cforward to working a second term\u201d with the 60-year-old.\\nPatel\u2019s affinity with Dick matters more. It might even explain why the commissioner has so steadfastly backed some of the home secretary\u2019s more controversial proposals such as restrictions on protest.\\nMarsh defines it as a \u201cworking relationship\u201d, with Dick\u2019s intelligence helping sustain a professional dynamic. However, the two are far from soulmates. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say they get on well. They\u2019re not cosy.\u201d It\u2019s also prudent to remember, he added, that Dick is not Patel\u2019s chosen one and was selected by former home secretary Theresa May.\\nBut Afzal is confident that as long as Dick, along with the capital\u2019s mayor, receives the flak for issues such as rising knife crime then Patel will readily indulge the status quo.\\n\u201cYet the truth is that Sadiq can only spend what the home secretary and Home Office give. The home secretary is the most powerful individual here \u2013 politically she decides what happens,\u201d he added.\\nAfzal, however, contests Marsh\u2019s assertion that the commissioner has universal grassroots support.\\n\u201cThere are a catalogue of failings under her leadership that demonstrably have not only impacted on the public\u2019s confidence but the officers themselves. Some of them have spoken to me and the morale is really low. Even before the Sarah Everard issue, throughout the pandemic they\u2019ve felt that they haven\u2019t had the leadership they needed.\u201d\\nEverard remains the final straw for many. Ten days ago Met officer Wayne Couzens pleaded guilty to killing the 33-year-old in south London amid allegations that police had failed to investigate previous incidents of indecent exposure by the killer. A vigil for Everard on Clapham Common had descended into chaos with women arrested amid allegations of heavy-handed policing. \u201cConcerns spiralled with the Everard killing and how the vigil was policed in an inconsistent way compared to other protests,\u201d said Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England.\\nCritics of the commissioner are also eager to dredge up the events of 16 years ago when Dick was gold commander in an operation that saw Jean Charles de Menezes shot dead at Stockwell tube station. Dick was exonerated, but the operation\u2019s control room was condemned as \u201cchaotic\u201d.\\nSince then the charge sheet against Dick has considerably lengthened. Further failings on her watch include allegations that officers posed for selfies with the bodies of the victims of the Wembley park murders last June. The high-profile stop and search of British athlete Bianca Williams in west London last year outraged London\u2019s black community.\\nDisquiet persists over Operation Midland, the Westminster sex abuse investigation that destroyed the lives of public figures on the testimony of a fantasist. Dick, who was briefly involved in the original operation, faces ongoing pressure to resign over this alone.\\nThe most recent criticisms focus on last Sunday\u2019s security failures at Wembley, with the force accused of failing to deploy sufficient officers or protect the venue from fans without tickets.\\nWeeks earlier, the Met\u2019s handling of the Daniel Morgan murder investigation led an official inquiry to brand the force \u201cinstitutionally corrupt.\u201d Dick was personally censured for obstruction.\\nThe findings over Morgan, says Chaudhri, proved the \u201ckiller\u201d factor for her on whether Dick should continue in her post. \u201cFirst we had the Met accused of institutional racism, then it was institutional corruption. There has to be a point where a line is drawn and they say: \u2018You know what? We\u2019ve got things wrong. We accept that.\u2019\\n\u201cThe biggest problem is the denial,\u201d said Chaudhri, a former detective superintendent who left the force in 2018 after 30 years.\\nBut it is also issues around race that for many, including Chaudhri, stain Dick\u2019s reputation. \u201cI got on very well with her, but I didn\u2019t feel that she really had a grip of what diversity really meant to her and policing.\u201d\\nShe points to how the enthusiastic policing of Black Lives Matter protests contrasted with the light touch taken against Extinction Rebellion demonstrations which paralysed London in 2019 and focused on high-profile areas.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very sensitive issue for black communities,\u201d said the 55-year-old. \u201cI get told that a lot of serving BAME officers are scared because of the BLM approach, the stop and search agenda. I get a lot of people saying they are tired of trying to explain themselves.\u201d\\nMarsh disagrees. \u201cOut of the 43 forces in England and Wales, no other beats us for diversity. They don\u2019t even get close.\u201d\\nFor others the ongoing youth violence epidemic is the issue that most weakens the commissioner\u2019s position. After all, they say, it was her priority when accepting the top job in 2017.\\nAfzal believes Dick should resign to avoid trust in the police being eroded and further denting its ability to tackle knife crime.\\n\u201cPolicing without public confidence just isn\u2019t going to happen. My concern is people are not going to come forward as either victims or witnesses,\u201d he warned.\\nHowever those on the frontline of knife crime reject such assertions. Elena Noel, chair of Southwark\u2019s anti-knife-crime forum and a former Home Office and London mayor adviser, states that not only is Dick \u201cculturally competent\u201d, but she also comprehends the complexities driving youth violence.\\n\u201cPlus she understands the black community. She\u2019s been brilliant. Cressida Dick is not to blame for knife crime. It needs a multi-agency approach,\u201d said Noel.\\nEven so, some of the commissioner\u2019s most ardent enthusiasts remain sceptical of her ambition to stay in post for another term.\\n\u201cFresh blood is always good,\u201d said Marsh. \u201cThere are people in the wings like [assistant commissioner] Neil Basu, eminent people who could take the force in another direction. I\u2019m not discrediting Cress but it\u2019s healthy to freshen things up. A term is a term.\u201d\\nDick appears confident a second term is attainable. Not since Paul Condon in the 1990s has a Met commissioner served two full terms. Despite the litany of scandals, Dame Cressida Dick will back herself to achieve it.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68f6c5e008f316c4d29e1be6e52106aa06b14d15/32_80_3442_2065/master/3442.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Cressida Dick following her investiture ceremony where she was made a dame, on July 14.

The products of just 100 private and state-owned fossil fuel companies were linked to 71% of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions since 1988, according to a groundbreaking 2017 report.\\nA subsequent Guardian investigation in 2019 found 20 fossil fuel companies, including Chevron and ExxonMobil, were responsible for more than one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions since 1965 \u2013 the point at which experts say fossil fuel companies were aware of the link between their products and climate change.\\nBut it\u2019s not just fossil fuel companies fueling the climate crisis. Even if we immediately phased out oil and gas, emissions from agriculture alone may make it impossible to limit warming to the 1.5C goal in the Paris agreement.\\nAcross a slew of sectors from food and fast fashion to construction and heavy industry, companies have helped drive climate chaos. As climate impacts accelerate \u2013 the world is boiling, burning, flooding and melting \u2013 there is unprecedented pressure on all companies to start taking their own role in the crisis far more seriously.\\nThis pressure is translating into action. A record number of companies are making climate pledges, but experts warn the pace of action remains glacially slow in the face of a barreling climate crisis.\\nEven if all current Paris agreement climate pledges are met, the world is still set to see temperature rises of about 2.4C by the end of the century \u2013 well above the 1.5C of warming that scientists say will already lead to severe climate impacts.\\nAs countries are under pressure to up their climate ambitions in the run-up to Cop26, the vital UN climate talks in November, the private sector is also being increasingly pushed by investors, employees, activists and consumers to take meaningful action.\\nIn response, corporations have put out a flurry of climate commitments. At least a fifth of the world\u2019s 2,000 largest public companies have now made some kind of \u201cnet zero\u201d pledge to cancel out their carbon emissions. They are investing billions in clean energy, moving to electric vehicles, pledging to halt deforestation, and urging the US government to step up climate action.\\nTech companies have perhaps some of the most far-reaching goals. Last year, Microsoft pledged to be \u201ccarbon negative\u201d by 2030, meaning it would remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits. By 2050, it aims to have compensated for all of its historical emissions through carbon removal projects.\\nApple says its products and supply chain will be carbon neutral by 2030 and Google has committed to be powered exclusively by renewable energy by 2030 and claims it has already wiped out its carbon footprint by offsetting emissions.\\nMost oil companies are moving far more slowly. Shell, BP, Total and Equinor have announced plans to reach \u201cnet zero\u201d emissions by 2050, but few have committed to halt fossil-fuel exploration. Some have gone much further and completely transformed their business model: Danish firm \u00d8rsted sold its oil and gas business in 2017 and has now installed more than a quarter of the world\u2019s offshore wind capacity.\\nThe transport industry, responsible for around one-fifth of global CO2 emissions, is gearing up for bolder climate pledges. GM Motors announced in January it would be carbon-neutral by 2040 and sell only zero emissions vehicles by 2035. The aviation sector, which has been slow to make climate pledges, is considering whether to set a goal of becoming net-zero by 2050.\\nLarge numbers of companies, including consumer-facing firms such as Ikea, PepsiCo and Levi\u2019s, are also signing up to the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which helps companies calculate emissions targets aligned with the Paris agreement ambition of 1.5C. More companies have signed up in the first half of 2021 than in the whole of 2020, according to a Bloomberg report.\\n\u201cA decade ago, companies were setting these very incremental targets,\u201d said Cynthia Cummis, co-founder of the SBTi and director of private sector climate mitigation at the World Resource Institute. \u201cNow science-based target setting is becoming standard practice.\u201d\\nAnd it\u2019s having an impact. An SBTi analysis of 338 large companies with science-based pledges found they had reduced combined emissions by 25% between 2015 and 2019.\\nCorporations are losing the ability to \u201cfudge the numbers\u201d on climate policies, said Ketan Joshi, an Oslo-based climate analyst who tracks company climate pledges. \u201cCompanies are increasingly starting to understand that they\u2019re losing their grip on the public relations hit of announcing a climate ambition and then doing nothing about it.\u201d\\nThere are still big caveats.\\nGlobal emissions are rebounding post-pandemic and 2023 is on track to see the highest levels of CO2 emissions in human history, according to the International Energy Agency.\\nDespite the record number of corporate climate pledges, an analysis of 9,300 listed companies from index provider MSCI published in July found that they are still on course to exceed their \u201ccarbon budgets\u201d \u2013 the total amount of emissions they can release and still keep in line with 1.5C of warming \u2013 within the next six years.\\nThis finding highlights the need for these companies to \u201cdramatically accelerate climate action\u201d, said Remy Briand, head of environmental, social and governance at MSCI. \u201cIt is easy to say that becoming net-zero is a high priority, but it is another to take action, especially immediate action.\u201d\\nWhile some companies have placed climate change at the top of their agenda, he added, others have made weak pledges or failed to act at all. \u201cFor those not matching their commitments or lagging, there should be nowhere left to hide.\u201d\\nAnalyzing what companies are actually doing, however, can be painstakingly difficult when there is no requirement to disclose all key climate information and little consistency in corporate pledges making it all but impossible to benchmark progress.\\nThe changes required are so vast that many companies struggle to even articulate them. In an evaluation of some of the world\u2019s largest greenhouse gas emitters, the investor engagement group Climate Action 100+ found no company has fully disclosed how it plans to reach net-zero.\\nWith many corporate net-zero pledges still several decades out, often with few interim targets, monitoring their effectiveness can be hard. \u201cWe cannot wait for 2050 to see whether we fulfil the commitments or not,\u201d said Gonzalo Mu\u00f1oz, UN high-level champion on climate for Cop25. \u201cIt\u2019s what we do today, and in these next five to 10 years, that will determine whether we succeed or not.\u201d\\nFiguring out how to quickly cut emissions is not an easy task for companies, which must work out not only how to reduce direct emissions and those from the energy that they use (scope 1 and scope 2 emissions), but also those which come from the use of their products (scope 3 emissions).\\nSome of the boldest pledges rely on carbon removal technologies that don\u2019t even exist yet, or at least not at the scale required. Many more are heavily reliant on carbon offsets, which allow companies to invest in \u201cnature-based\u201d programs like tree planting or forest protection to counteract their own emissions. Offset projects, however, have been plagued by allegations of flawed accounting, greenwash and sometimes even of actively fueling climate change.\\nThese climate pledges are also voluntary. To some, this shows that industry is trying to take responsibility for its own emissions. For others, it looks more like an effort at self-regulation to avoid government intervention.\\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have time for voluntary corporate initiatives any more,\u201d said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International. \u201cWe\u2019ve done them for decades and they haven\u2019t worked. I think there\u2019s a real need for governments to be coming in and putting in place some legislative and regulatory frameworks.\u201d\\nMany companies have publicly called for governments to take stronger climate action; behind the scenes it can be a different story.\\nAmazon and Microsoft, for example, have been criticized for pitching themselves as climate leaders while also donating tens of thousands of dollars to politicians who oppose climate action. An Amazon spokesperson said it actively advocates for clean energy policies and a spokesperson for Microsoft said that to make progress the company \u201cmust engage with candidates and officeholders who hold a range of views\u201d.\\nThe lobbying efforts of fossil fuel majors, meanwhile, are well documented. The five largest publicly traded oil and gas companies spent over $1bn on misleading climate-related branding and lobbying in the three years following the Paris agreement in 2015, according to a 2019 report by InfluenceMap.\\nA host of investigations has revealed big fossil fuel companies knew about the link between their products and climate change for decades but continued to argue that climate science was uncertain and to push against climate action. Just last month an Exxon lobbyist was caught on tape by the investigative outlet Unearthed describing how the company was actively working against key US climate policies through lobbying and membership of trade associations.\\nThese same firms also encouraged a public narrative of individual responsibility for the climate crisis. British Petroleum notoriously helped to popularize the term \u201ccarbon footprint\u201d with an online calculator that encouraged people to measure their own emissions.\\nThis focus on personal responsibility is echoed in other sectors, which advertise \u201cmore sustainable\u201d products while continuing business-as-usual models of consumption and production.\\n\u201cThe discussion that moves us away from corporate responsibility to personal responsibility is a huge distraction,\u201d said Shannon Lloyd, an assistant professor of management at Concordia University in Canada. \u201cAs an individual, your choices have very little impact in terms of reducing the carbon or other environmental footprint of products. It\u2019s more about getting laws put in place or policies in place than individual purchasing decisions.\u201d\\nReaching a net-zero world will entail \u201cwholesale transformation\u201d in both infrastructure and how things are done, said Steven Clarke, director for corporate clean energy leadership at non-profit Ceres. \u201cSome people refer to it as on the scale of a second industrial revolution.\u201d\\nCertain key sectors will face big challenges. There\u2019s a lack of easy answers for some energy-intensive industries with huge carbon footprints, such as steel, cement, aviation and shipping, which are notoriously hard to decarbonize. Sectors which rely on high consumption of products with big climate footprints, such as fast fashion and meat, will also need to adapt significantly for the world to limit temperature rise to 1.5C.\\nBut there is huge potential for innovation and action. Most solar and wind projects are now expected to be cheaper than coal. Investment is flowing into \u201cgreen hydrogen\u201d, which could provide zero-emissions fuel for ships and airplanes and replace fossil fuels in steel manufacturing.\\nMeanwhile, pressure on companies is intensifying. More than 1,500 lawsuits have been brought against fossil fuel companies. This number could accelerate thanks to advances in climate science making it easier to link climate damage to corporate activity. Employees are another lever for change.\\nIn 2020, hundreds of Amazon workers criticized the company for climate inaction last year. This year the non-profit ClimateVoice launched a campaign mobilizing employees to demand that big tech companies spend more of their lobbying dollars on climate policy.\\nCompanies cannot tackle the climate crisis by themselves, said Jamie Beck Alexander of Project Drawdown, a non-profit focused on climate solutions, \u201cregulation will absolutely be required to transform entire sectors.\u201d But this doesn\u2019t let them off the hook, she added. \u201cIf business leaders truly grasped the seriousness of this crisis, they would immediately pivot their entire business models and resources toward scaling climate solutions full stop.\u201d", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce12a2df29ff68169acb23afc86424854eed4488/0_0_6250_3750/master/6250.jpg?width=480&dpr=1&s=none", "A record number of companies are making climate pledges, but experts say action remains far too slow."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b37b9b86c5cb870134dcd57d3333fe88a078799/0_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Rooftop solar on Ikea\u2019s store in Kaarst, Germany"]], "author": null, "date": "2021-07-26"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/jul/18/chris-packham-people-like-me-sense-of-injustice-autism-extinction-rebellion": {"title": "Chris Packham: \u2018People like me have a very aggravated sense of injustice\u2019", "subtitle": null, "text": "At his New Forest home, the broadcaster and activist discusses autism, Extinction Rebellion and his  Self-Isolating Bird Club\\nOver the years, the BBC has seeded and nurtured some singular specimens of presenter. Chris Packham, after a decade of Springwatch, has begun to grow into that space in the public mind once occupied by, say, John Noakes or Patrick Moore or John Peel. He\u2019s blunt and lyrical and you know for sure that the camera is only eavesdropping on his authentic life \u2013 in much the same way that he peers in at nesting boxes and fox dens \u2013 and once it\u2019s turned off, he goes on just the same.\\nHe\u2019s invited me down to lunch in his natural habitat on the edge of the New Forest. He\u2019s never strayed far from here for very long. He grew up on the other side of Southampton cycling to the woods, living an I-Spy childhood, scooping up tadpoles, examining beetles, for a while with a beloved kestrel as his closest friend. He went to university in Southampton and for many years he rented a thatched cottage a mile or two up the road from here; in between lockdowns, he traded those low beams and history for the clean lines of his new angular home \u2013 all decking and cladding and sheet glass \u2013 set in a couple of acres of wooded garden and bordered by a stream.\\nHe can\u2019t cook (\u201cpeople always think I\u2019m making an attempt on their life\u201d) so lunch \u2013 a delicious bowl of asparagus tabouleh with mint and coriander and bulgur wheat \u2013 is being made by his longtime partner, Charlotte Corney, who runs the Wildheart Animal Sanctuary on the Isle of Wight. They\u2019ve been together for a decade, though always a ferry ride apart, having met through the zoo she inherited from her parents.\\nPackham, you have the sense, is perhaps not always the easiest man to provide for. \u201cHe used to only eat salad,\u201d Corney says. He became vegan a couple of years ago \u2013 giving up cheese coincided with selling a farmhouse that he owned south of Bordeaux (\u201ca man around the corner kept goats and used to bring round this plate of half a dozen conker-sized cheeses, which were impossible to resist\u201d). He eats no fruit at all, shudders at the thought of it, so pomegranate seeds are a side dish here rather than part of the main bowl, and he winces and looks away from the strawberries that Corney brings out afterwards. It was only a few years into their relationship that Packham explained that he had been diagnosed in 2005 as having Asperger\u2019s syndrome \u2013 which no doubt helped to explain both his concentrated passion for all things living, and his sometimes apparent indifference to those closest to him.\\nLockdown suited him just fine, he says. His stepdaughter from a previous relationship, Megan McCubbin, lodged with him and his two black poodles, Sid and Nancy. On the first morning after the shutters came down, last March, he wandered out into the garden and did an impromptu piece to his phone screen about the celandines that had burst into life in the cottage garden under a horse chestnut tree \u201cwanting to share them with people who were waking to a new kind of fear\u201d. That Twitter video caught the eye of a young fan and producer, Fabian Harrison, who suggested that Packham made it a regular ad hoc broadcast. By lockdown two the daily output of the Self-Isolating Bird Club \u2013 which Packham presented alongside McCubbin \u2013 was reaching 8 million people worldwide. It has spawned a collaborative book, Back to Nature, subtitled \u201cHow to love life \u2013 and save it\u201d, written by the pair of them, a personal handbook for an urgent rebooting of our relationship with the natural world.\\n\u201cWe were sort of locked in that little utopian bubble,\u201d Packham says of the past year or so. \u201cWe\u2019d go out once a week to get food for my father, who is on his own, and Megan was doing all the Zoom pub quizzes and so on. But I was pretending I was 14 again \u2013 the last time I had so much time in one place consecutively. When you are away for a week here and you go out into the woods, it\u2019s like you\u2019ve gone into a room and someone\u2019s redecorated it, everything has changed. Last year, walking through that space, I felt that change in a much more comfortable way.\u201d Each evening, at midnight, Packham, 60, reconnected with another formative aspect of his adolescence, trawling through his extensive 1970s record collection and picking a track to play to his Twitter followers on #PunkRockMidnight.\\nThe other good thing about the forced isolation, he says, leaning back from the lunch table in a patch of shade from the hot sun, is that it gave him a bit of a breather from protesting. In recent years he has become a natural frontman for Extinction Rebellion, though he does not claim to support every one of its aims or methods. \u201cA lot of the \u2013 necessary \u2013 campaigning that we were doing was highlighting problems, rather than offering solutions,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Self-Isolating Bird Club felt good because it was a solution to a problem for a lot of people. We could stop shouting at people, put our placards away for a bit.\u201d\\nPackham is happy to accept that in some quarters he might be thought of as an extremist, just so long as it opens the conversations about climate and the environment that are desperately needed. The Wild Justice group he founded with fellow conservationists Ruth Tingay and Mark Avery aims to bring a similar crowdfunded edge of litigation to wildlife issues as Jolyon Maugham\u2019s Good Law Project does to governance. In looking for legal ways to protect ancient woodlands from HS2, or stop the cull of badgers, or regulate against the environmental damage of field sports, he knows he is in for long and exhausting battles.\\nWild Justice\u2019s most successful campaign so far saw a new licensing regime for the indiscriminate shooting of a range of birds including jays and magpies in England. He was undeterred by the vicious threats against him from opponents that included an incident in which two dead crows were left hanging at his garden gate. \u201cYou\u2019re asking people to change their minds,\u201d he says, \u201cand more quickly than they want to \u2013 a tiny percentage of those people are going to lash out and be extremely unpleasant.\u201d\\nHe also refers to an article in that morning\u2019s Telegraph in which his most vociferous opponent, the recently ennobled hunting, shooting and fishing advocate Ian Botham, has called him out for once working as a tour guide for a long-haul travel company. \u201cIt\u2019s just bullshit. The thing he\u2019s talking about was something that I did four years ago. But if you spent all your time trying to deal with the negative stuff, you wouldn\u2019t have time to do any good\u2026\u201d\\nHe admits that his intransigent punk spirit fuels some of his campaigning \u2013 though that is hard to separate from his Asperger\u2019s (he has noted his kinship with Greta Thunberg in this regard, who calls the condition \u201cher superpower\u201d).\\n\u201cPeople like me,\u201d he says, \u201chave a very aggravated sense of injustice, and I think it\u2019s been highly motivational in my life.\u201d\\nHis bestselling memoir, Fingers in the Sparkle Jar, and a subsequent BBC documentary have made him as much in demand as a speaker on mental health as on nature-watching (he doesn\u2019t separate the two necessarily). He has another BBC film in production on these issues, which he hopes might help kids who grew up, like him, knowing they were different, but not knowing why.\\n\u201cI\u2019m not an expert on autism. I\u2019m someone that has it,\u201d he says. \u201cI can only ever talk about my experience.\u201d In doing so he realises that \u201cthere will be things that my family, which is basically my dad and my sister, Megan and Charlotte, will probably find a little bit uncomfortable\u201d. Most notably perhaps, his habit of suggesting candidly that the greatest loves of his life have been his dogs and his kestrel. Corney is long used to his ways, of course, and watching them together reminds you that love comes in many different forms. Packham has a habit of marking each meal she makes out of 10. \u201cWell?\u201d she wonders. He thinks for a bit, ponders the pomegranate seeds. \u201cSix maybe seven,\u201d he says.\\nHe understands himself enough to smile at his bluntness, and alone he speaks very fondly of Corney \u2013 and of his stepdaughter McCubbin, who has been a companion on field trips across the world since she was a toddler.\\n\u201cI have a number of sentimental treasures,\u201d he says. \u201cNot a great number. I\u2019ve got the handwritten lyrics to Shout Above the Noise by the punk band Penetration. And then alongside it, I\u2019ve got a little Post-it note in a frame that Megan once left stuck to the front door.\u201d It says simply: \u201cGone to rebel\u201d. She is clearly a woman after his own heart.\\nBack to Nature: How to Love Life and Save It is out now in paperback (Two Roads, \u00a38.99).

A riff on the biblical floods, it reflected on human extinction with laughs along the way.\\nNow comes another climate drama in which De Angelis declares her XR affiliations, but with no hint of levity. We begin in a dystopic 2030. The narrator, played by Kiran Landa, tells us of a nuclear hot sun, marauding gangs and shootouts in M&S food halls. The scenario bears some echoes of pandemic stresses, from the food queues to the pervading panic.\\nBut just as the scene is set, the story switches. Landa announces herself as the writer \u2013 De Angelis \u2013 and begins to present an argument for urgent climate action. \u201cWe are now experiencing the sixth mass extinction,\u201d she says and weaves together facts and figures on everything from forest fires, floods, greenhouse gases and deforestation to oil and plastics, with recorded testimonies from XR members.\\nDirected by Kirsty Housley, this turn pulls the rug from under our feet at first and makes the show feel like an XR action rather than a play. At times, it looks and sounds like an educational documentary, with diagrams flashing up on projections across the floor and on an angled screen above the set.\\nBut this lecture builds its drama with its own gripping truth. We hear that the bubonic plague lurks within the planet\u2019s melting ice (\u201cWhat new pandemics lurk in the future?\u201d), that the soil is disappearing, that vegetation is becoming less nutritious and that forest fires are triggering \u201cfire tornadoes\u201d. The testimony of a British Bengali woman, Suhayla, who returns to her grandmothers in Bangladesh to tell the story of the floods that are destroying huge swathes of life, is especially powerful.\\nLanda gives a rousing performance while Nina Dunn\u2019s projections are atmospheric and look epic on upper and lower screens, from drifting clouds to undulating ocean waves. The writing, too, has standout moments, and is novelistic in its descriptions. All elements combined create a sense of dread and danger.\\nThe work\u2019s \u201cmaking\u201d is explicit: it takes place before us with cameras, green screens and audio recordings turned on and off. These meta elements, along with the overt switch to theatrical activism, trigger certain questions: is this a play or a piece of polemic? Does a drama always require the suspension of disbelief? Can a lecture be a drama if it contains story and suspense?\\nExtinct makes the point that climate apocalypse is within sight \u2013 not so very removed from the initial, imagined scenario in 2030, and that we need to act. \u201cI have an hour to convert you to the cause of climate change,\u201d says the narrator. Even if Extinct preaches to the converted, there is plenty of power in that. Here, it feels necessary and urgent.\\nExtinct is at Theatre Royal Stratford East until 17 July and will also be streamed from 13 to 18 July.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/def799c8e0a2b30e514dd314b2b2cfa3e9e99f90/0_215_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Kiran Landa in Extinct."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/822aaa8f8b5721a9330dcadf13174dc58ccdb721/0_75_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Kiran Landa in Extinct, whole set view"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09378dc88497e38fb844bbf5ab64a884f4227c93/0_0_4800_3200/master/4800.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Kiran Landa in Extinct, with watering can and plants"]], "author": ["Arifa Akbar"], "date": "2021-07-04"}}
