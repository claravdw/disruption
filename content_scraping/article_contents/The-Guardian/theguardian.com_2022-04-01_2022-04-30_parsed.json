The crowd moved off at about midday for the march through central London, staging roadblocks on the way.\\nDirect actions were planned on the fringes of the march against specific targets, but XR kept quiet on the details of what those targets were.\\nDuring the morning, protesters mainly milled about, joining with affinity groups, greeting friends who they had not seen since previous actions, and enjoying a burst of spring sunshine.\\nNicky Goulianis, 33, from London, stood in the middle of the crowd with her nine-month-old daughter, Clio, in a buggy. Asked why she had joined the protest, she answered: \u201cAll the reasons.\u201d\\n\u201cI\u2019ve been living away from the UK but I have been admiring the movement from afar, and I think it\u2019s inspiring, the turnout here. I have been living in New York and I saw echoes of it in New York and I\u2019m really excited to join today,\u201d Goulianis said.\\n\u201cI think we need radical action. I think often the oil and gas lobby does a good job of making us think it\u2019s about individual consumption, but we need to change everything.\u201d\\nOn the edges of the crowd, with a small group, stood Marcelo Cervone, 28, who had adorned the peak of his baseball cap with XR stickers. He said: \u201cI want to safeguard my son\u2019s future \u2026 he\u2019s four months old and I want to make sure he can dream but, as we were allowed to, dream big.\u201d\\nCervone said he had been protesting with XR for several years. \u201cWe are all hoping we can end the fossil fuel economy. That\u2019s the number one goal: immediate transition out of the fossil fuel economy,\u201d he said.\\nDr Graeme Hayes, an academic at Aston University who studies social movements, was also among those who gathered in Hyde Park. He has observed, researched and analysed XR since its inception in 2018.\\n\u201cThis is not a different thing. This feels like the same thing it looked like three years ago but probably with fewer people, and obviously its corralled out into a less enclosed space,\u201d Hayes said.\\n\u201cThe move from Parliament Square to Hyde Park is also that move from three years of interaction with policing and not being able to hold that public space.\u201d\\nHayes said he felt ideological barriers were preventing XR from evolving.\\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken lots of photos of all the different signs; so many are focused on children or your children\u2019s children,\u201d he said.\\n\u201cThere is always a sense of how justice is a relationship to the future. There is a displacement of justice. As usual there\u2019s loads about justice and it\u2019s about Africa, and of course that is really important, but it\u2019s not about here and it\u2019s not about now. I\u2019m trying to look for things about capitalism, for example, and it\u2019s hard to find.\u201d", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1d49b8f5b6550c7b04c65b0b1ac6812842b2702/0_186_5681_3407/master/5681.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Protesters gather in Hyde Park for an Extinction Rebellion march through London"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e6dcc4d7f10bfcac7b799e002759570ff606472/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Extinction Rebellion protesters take part in a sit-down demonstration at Oxford Circus"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00d352746e10fd9b279052c821e100eb4468335c/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "An Extinction Rebellion protester in Hyde Park"]], "author": ["Damien Gayle"], "date": "2022-04-09"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/29/just-stop-oils-protests-funded-by-us-philanthropists": {"title": "Just Stop Oil\u2019s \u2018spring uprising\u2019 protests funded by US philanthropists", "subtitle": null, "text": "LA-based based Climate Emergency Fund donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to activists\\nJust Stop Oil\u2019s disruptive protests, blamed for petrol shortages across parts of England, have been funded by US philanthropists who say they want to incite a global \u201cspring uprising\u201d over climate change.\\nThe environmental activists, whose oil terminal blockades have enraged ministers and rightwing commentators, have received hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Los Angeles-based Climate Emergency Fund (CEF).\\n\u201cWe\u2019re their lead institutional funder,\u201d CEF\u2019s executive director, Margaret Klein Salamon, said. \u201cI think actually their exclusive institutional funder at this point.\u201d\\nOn Friday, eight Just Stop Oil activists were still being held after 43 were arrested for allegedly blockading and smashing petrol pumps at service stations on London\u2019s M25 orbital motorway. About 400 people have been arrested more than 1,000 times taking part in the campaign since it began less than a month ago, according to organisers\u2019 own tally.\\n\u201cA lot of groups we fund use civil disobedience and high stakes civil disobedience,\u201d Salamon said. \u201cBut Just Stop Oil to me is the next stage, the next evolution of climate campaigning, in that they really seem to me to be operating as a nonviolent army with that level of discipline, planning, coordination.\\n\u201cI\u2019m so impressed with what they\u2019ve been able to do with extremely slim resources and, you know, not that many activists.\u201d\\nThis year CEF has made grants of $1.7m to activists in 25 countries, including the UK, the US, Australia Canada, France, Germany and Switzerland. It has particularly focused on the UK with $650,000 given this year to groups including Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion. Salamon confirmed CEF had donated Just Stop Oil hundreds of thousands of dollars. Extinction Rebellion had received about $200,000 from the fund this year, she said.\\nCEF has earmarked $1.3m of its donations for a \u201cspring uprising\u201d to revive the climate protest movement. Before Covid, Salamon said, \u201cthe movement was just on absolutely an upswing, gaining so much momentum, with Earth Day 2020 supposed to be the largest environmental demonstration in history\u201d.\\n\u201cCovid just absolutely took the wind out of its sails and so this uprising this April is the answer to that, as far as I\u2019m concerned. It\u2019s like, OK, the movement\u2019s back and there\u2019s energy. Just Stop Oil and Scientists Rebellion are great examples of how it\u2019s not just back, it\u2019s levelled up during the last two years.\u201d\\nInsulate Britain, whose roadblock protests last autumn polarised public opinion but catalysed a national debate around its demand to insulate every home, were also funded by CEF. This year, it is funding nine groups in various different countries copying the road blockade tactic.\\nCEF operated like venture capital, according to Salamon, seeking out small groups who could benefit hugely from $50,000 to $100,000 donations that would barely make a difference to the larger environmental charities.\\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for ultra-ambitious groups and campaigns, generally that are quite new, that have a plan to scale up and make a huge impact,\u201d Salamon said. Direct action, in which those taking part put themselves in either legal or personal peril, was preferred as a way to communicate the urgency of the crisis.\\nSalamon insisted CEF does not fund any illegal activity. \u201cWhat we do fund is recruitment, training, organising staff, core staff, etc \u2026 and we fund legal protest and disruption,\u201d she said.\\n\u201cThe fact that some of these groups get into harder edged civil disobedience, that\u2019s their choice. And we think that from a historic and social science perspective, it\u2019s very well supported, and we commend their bravery in doing so.\u201d\\nAll the groups funded by the CEF must be committed to non-violence. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t fund groups, presently, that allow their membership to take action while concealing their identities,\u201d Salamon said.\\nDonations to CEF come mainly from wealthy individuals and family foundations. The fund was started with a $500,000 donation from Aileen Getty, the granddaughter of Jean Paul Getty whose petrochemical empire made him the world\u2019s richest man, a source of some controversy in the climate activist world.\\nAdam McKay, the producer and screenwriter behind the climate change satire Don\u2019t Look Up, had just donated $250,000, \u201cparticularly inspired by Just Stop Oil, Scientist Rebellion and other civil resistance\u201d, Salamon said.\\nConcerns have been raised about the funding of direct action groups by wealthy individuals.\\nSalamon said she was aware of concerns around \u201ccapitalist corruption\u201d but she insisted that the CEF did not demand its grantees tone down their protests or critique. She pointed out that Scientists Rebellion had explicitly called for economic de-growth. Other groups have targeted banks and corporations.\\n\u201cI think that we need to solve the climate emergency from the system we have,\u201d Salamon said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t transform it, we absolutely have to, but I think we need to channel capital from wealthy individuals to the movement and to the cause of just emergency speed decarbonisation and restoring a safe climate, and living within planetary limits.\u201d\\nCEF was keen to be more transparent about the work it was doing \u2013 and hopefully attract more donors, Salamon said. \u201cAnd listen, regarding the abuse, which I totally agree is coming, if the activists can take it, so can we,\u201d she said.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74cdbdb50ed9d20ea06b2eac5c5008fcec0d2580/0_99_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "An arrest is made as activists from Just Stop Oil target a Shell Petrol station on the M25 motorway on April 28, 2022."]], "author": ["Damien Gayle"], "date": "2022-04-29"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/13/just-stop-oil-climate-crisis-good-morning-britain": {"title": "I went on TV to explain Just Stop Oil \u2013 and it became a parody of Don\u2019t Look Up", "subtitle": null, "text": "I wanted to sound the alarm about oil exploration and the climate crisis, but Good Morning Britain just didn\u2019t want to hear\\nI hadn\u2019t seen the 2021 satirical film Don\u2019t Look Up when I went on Good Morning Britain on Tuesday. I was there on behalf of Just Stop Oil \u2013 a group that has been engaging in direct action by blockading oil terminals. We\u2019re demanding that the UK government ends all new oil licences, exploration and consent in the North Sea. It\u2019s a simple message that\u2019s in line with science.\\nBut the simplicity of our demands seemed to annoy my interviewer, Richard Madeley. \u201cBut you\u2019d accept, wouldn\u2019t you, that it\u2019s a very complicated discussion to be had, it\u2019s a very complicated thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this \u2018Just Stop Oil\u2019 slogan is very playground-ish isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s very Vicky Pollard, quite childish.\u201d I then proceeded to talk about the recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which confirmed that it is \u201cnow or never\u201d to avoid climate catastrophe. But they didn\u2019t seem to care.\\nPeople were quick to point out the parallels with a key scene in Don\u2019t Look Up, when Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s characters, both astronomers, go on a morning talkshow to inform the public about a comet that\u2019s heading to Earth, potentially leading to an extinction-level event. The newsreaders don\u2019t care about what they have to say: they prefer to \u201ckeep the bad news light\u201d.\\nNow that I\u2019ve watched the film, I understand the references people have been making. The worst part is that these presenters and journalists think they know better than chief scientists or academics who have been studying the climate crisis for decades, and they refuse to hear otherwise. It is wilful blindness and it is going to kill us.\\nThe response to the interview on social media has been very supportive, but we need to translate that support into action. If the thousands of people on Twitter who disagree with Madeley\u2019s approach joined the actions of Just Stop Oil, the possibilities for change would be endless. When the interview finished, I tried to speak more to Ranvir Singh and Madeley to stress how serious this is; Madeley just told me to be quiet and watched the weather presenter.\\nMy fear is that they will only understand the reality of the climate crisis when it is on the doorstep, perhaps when the floodwater is uncontrollably trickling into their homes, or when they can no longer find food in the supermarkets. Maybe then the brutal reality of losing a \u201clivable planet\u201d means would actually sink in. Maybe then the journalists, presenters and climate delayers would think: \u201cOh, maybe we should have listened, done something.\u201d And, of course, it will be too late.\\nGiven the government\u2019s inaction, which I believe will be judged as criminal in the near future, there are no longer any options left than to take clear direct action in the form of civil resistance. Some of my best friends are now preparing for their next action. This will be their fourth in 12 days, perhaps also leading to their fourth time sleeping in a police cell. They are between 20 and 23. They have degrees and jobs. They should be enjoying their final weeks at university and preparing to celebrate their graduation; instead, they are putting their bodies in the way to grind the distribution of oil to a halt. No matter what the government or the media say, these are good people who are terrified for their future. They are refusing to just sit by while their government pours more fuel on their dreams and lets them go up in smoke.\\nCivil resistance is really not about protests or marches, it is about responding to a situation beyond our worst nightmares. At Cop26, the people who run things effectively confirmed that they were going to let billions of the poorest people on this planet die in order to keep business as usual going.\\nWell, to that we say no. We will not continue as generations have before and allow our actions today to have devastating consequences on those tomorrow. It is time to break that cycle and stand up for what is right. \u201cIf governments are serious about the climate crisis, there can be no new investments in oil, gas and coal, from now \u2013 from this year.\u201d That is a direct quote from Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency. He said that last year. Time has quite literally run out. It only takes one quick search on the internet to see what is happening. Somalia. Madagascar. Yemen. Australia. Canada.

On Friday afternoon, activists staged a series of sit-ins on the bridges, cutting off some of the main traffic arteries of the capital.\\nFor one period Blackfriars bridge was held by a single 76-year-old woman who lay in the road and refused to move. Lucy Harding, from Reading, said she had first learned about climate change from her step-son in 1976.\\n\u201cThat\u2019s a long time to know that we are in danger and it has been really frightening to see it coming closer and closer, seeing tipping point after tipping point pass,\u201d Harding said. \u201cIt\u2019s awful to be 76, to actually see the end of my life coming, and knowing what has been left behind.\u201d\\nAbout two dozen officers from City of London police surrounded Harding, who said she was determined to be arrested. However, she voluntarily ended her blockade after officers refused to pick her up and threatened to call an ambulance to take her away.\\nIn a statement, XR said: \u201cWe\u2019re calling for an immediate end to new fossil fuel investments as part of the rebellion and ongoing actions by Just Stop Oil continue.\u201d Met police said they were on scene and working to manage the impact.\\nElsewhere, several oil companies obtained civil injunctions to stop climate protesters while dozens of climate protesters were charged after launching synchronised actions targeting three key fuel distribution terminals early on Friday morning.\\nEnergy Minister Greg Hands said: \u201cWhile we value the right to peaceful protest, it is crucial that these do not cause disruption to people\u2019s everyday lives. That\u2019s why I\u2019m pleased to see oil companies taking action to secure injunctions at their sites, working with local police forces to arrest those who break the law and ensure deliveries of fuel can continue as normal.\u201d\\nActivists were arrested at the Kingsbury oil terminal near Tamworth, Staffordshire, and the Inter terminal in Grays and the Navigator terminal in West Thurrock, which are both on the banks of the Thames and supply petrol stations in east London and across the south-east.\\nWarwickshire police said: \u201cOfficers remain at Kingsbury oil terminal today and are currently dealing with protest activity after a number of protesters arrived overnight.

But while the rest were released, she was being kept in a cell at Charing Cross police station until she could be brought before a court on Saturday morning.\\nHer hunger strike was in protest at the conditions in which she was being kept, Smith said. She was being kept in a windowless cell, without a proper bed, and with the lights on 24 hours a day.\\nIn a message to the Guardian from inside her cell, relayed by Smith, Smart said: \u201cHow come I\u2019m the one being persecuted here for committing criminal damage with BEIS is still issuing new fossil fuel licences which will cause damage to the environment and future generations?\u201d\\nOn Friday, Smith was with scientists and medics at an XR protest outside Charing Cross police station. Jeff Waage, a professor of international development at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, held a placard outside the police station doors saying: \u201cScience says new oil and gas = death.\u201d\\nHe said: \u201cThe arrests of scientists, keeping them from speaking out, is wrong and it\u2019s preventing us from actually reaching the public with important scientific messages that are coming out of international research.\u201d\\nSmith said the Metropolitan police had initially refused to release his wife because they said wrongly she was breaking bail conditions by taking part in the protest.\\nAfter realising those bail conditions did not apply and were no longer in force, police then decided they would hold her because they deemed her \u201ca serial bail condition breaker\u201d, Smith said.\\nHe added: \u201cNormally when they do things like this it is for people that have committed crimes that impact on society heavily, abusive crimes or domestic violence or stuff like that \u2013 if there is a continued risk.\\n\u201cIn this instance she was arrested for quite a minor crime of criminal damage on a government building. Also there was no disruption there, it was a targeted protest, so it\u2019s quite unusual for them to take this line.\\n\u201cLegally they can, but it is quite unusual protocol for them to do that. She should have had the same bail conditions as all the other scientists, which was: stay out of Westminster.\u201d\\nRaj Chada, of Hodge Jones Allen, the firm of solicitors representing Smart, said: \u201cWe are urgently seeking Emmas release from her potentially unlawful detention.

So why is it uniting radical environmentalists, ecologists and Sami reindeer herders in protest?\\nThe stove gurgles as Sofia Olsson puts a chunk of wood into the fire, lifts the kettle and offers mugs of tea and grainy camp coffee to the small group reclining on reindeer skins around her. In the taiga forest and frozen marsh outside their snow-covered Swedish military tent, it\u2019s -12C (10.4F). Last night, it was near -20C (-4F). But inside, it\u2019s surprisingly comfortable.\n  Olsson and her fellow activists Jakob Bowers and Lan Pham have been here in the hamlet of Hukanmaa, in Pajala, Sweden\u2019s most northerly municipality, on and off for more than a year, camping since December. The camp is an outpost of Forest Rebellion, an off-shoot of Swedish Extinction Rebellion, which says it is organising a campaign of \u201cpeaceful civil disobedience\u201d with the Sami people against Arctic deforestation.\\nSome leading names in environmental activism have started to congregate in Swedish Sapmi, the Sami ancestral homeland, an area that stretches over parts of Finland, Norway and Russia. The German ecologist and author Carola Rackete \u2013 who made headlines in 2019 when she was arrested for captaining a ship that landed refugees on Lampedusa, Italy, without authorisation after a 17-day standoff \u2013 has arrived from her home in Norway.\\nA 15-minute ski across the frozen marsh, the Greenpeace activist Dima Litvinov has also set up a protest base. Litvinov was one of the \u201cArctic 30\u201d who came to global fame in 2013 after being seized at gunpoint by Russian special forces and jailed for trying to halt Russian oil drilling in the Arctic.\\nGreta Thunberg has been up to the region, too, to oppose a planned iron ore mine at G\u00e1llok near the town of Jokkmokk. Sweden gave the disputed mine qualified approval in March on the basis that it will enable sustainable steel production and help cut carbon emissions, but Thunberg condemned the decision as \u201cracist\u201d and \u201ccolonial\u201d because of its disregard for reindeer migration patterns and the impact it would have on Sami communities. On Twitter, she accused Sweden of \u201cwaging a war on nature\u201d.\\nDefending the land rights of the Sami \u2013 semi-nomadic reindeer herders who are the EU\u2019s only remaining Indigenous people \u2013 is fast becoming one of the big campaigning issues for activists across Europe, bringing together climate protesters in the Nordic states with veterans of ongoing German coal protests and the Mediterranean refugee crisis.\\nThe Sami rights issue overlaps with the fight against climate inaction but it also threatens to drive a wedge between those green campaigners who believe green industry can provide some of the solutions and those who fear that it will come at the expense of the Arctic environment and the Sami who depend on it.\\nThe number of international activists here is tiny for now, but as the battle to stop the G\u00e1llok mine and other green mega-industrial projects begin to be realised, Litvinov and Rackete expect many more will join the Arctic struggle.\\nAround the campfire this morning the debate is about future strategy. The immediate target of protests is logging in Swedish Sapmi. The group have recently succeeded in stopping the Swedish state-owned forestry company Sveaskog\u2019s timber harvesting machine.\\nNobody is celebrating yet, however. \u201cThere was some excitement that by putting up this relatively small camp for a day, we forced a reaction at the Sveaskog headquarters,\u201d says Rackete. \u201cBut the forestry industry is not going to change its behaviour overnight.\u201d\\nA consensus is reached about staying put for a month to make sure the company is true to its word, and to run training camps for activists in preparation for the Arctic battles ahead. \u201cWe want to give them experience of skiing, snowshoeing and living up here,\u201d Rackete says, \u201cbecause I really think you will see many more actions up here in the coming years.\u201d\\nBut Rackete, Litvinov and the others are convinced that to truly defend the Sami way of life, they will need to embrace what seems like a paradox and oppose renewable energy projects, including Arctic wind parks, \u201cgreen steel\u201d and other parts of the so-called green transition intended to help Europe meet its global climate obligations.\\n\u201cIf we have ambitions to really change things, to enable reindeer herding and Sami life to keep going, we\u2019re going to have to mobilise against all sorts of extraction projects,\u201d says Bowers. This, he adds, should include the \u201cgreen transformation\u201d of Sweden\u2019s far-north, with its industry-leading plans for coal-free steel, its near-completed EV car battery gigafactory and the vast wind power projects needed to power it all.\\nThe green industrial transformation of northern Sweden is central to the nation\u2019s claims to become a climate world leader. In her inauguration speech in November, the prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, hailed the \u201cramping up of a green industrial revolution\u201d, with \u201cCO2-free steel production, battery factories \u2026 tens of thousands of new jobs\u201d and 700bn kronor (\u00a357bn) invested in green industry in Sweden\u2019s Arctic north. \u201cSweden must show the outside world how the climate transition creates jobs and growth,\u201d she said.\n  It\u2019s easy to become enthused by the supposed climate benefits. The state company LKAB\u2019s plans to produce hydrogen-reduced iron instead of iron ore pellets for example, promises to cut a Switzerland-sized chunk from Europe\u2019s total carbon emissions by allowing steel plants to close their blast furnaces.\\n\u201cAll of this is like some sort of promise for the future, but it\u2019s destroying what we actually have right now,\u201d Bowers says. \u201cWe know that the Sami people have been able to live with their environment. But with these green projects, there\u2019s no proof that it\u2019s actually going to reduce emissions.\u201d\\nBowers falls back on an argument one might expect to hear from a fossil fuels advocate. \u201cIf you look at wind power, studies have shown an increase in emissions, because of all the mining and transport infrastructure.\u201d\\nFrom the point of view of Henrik Andersson, a Sami reindeer herder, green industrial projects are worse even than the Malmberget iron ore mine, which started on Sami summer herding grounds back in 1735 and then, after a rail link was built in 1888, grew into one of biggest mines in the world.\\nAndersson, from the G\u00e4llivare reindeer herding district, contacted Extinction Rebellion two years ago, bringing activists up from southern Sweden and talking with them through the night in his remote cabin (and surprising the vegans among them with servings of reindeer stew and blood sausage).\\nAndersson and his community are on the frontline of the climate crisis. Sapmi recorded a temperature of 33.6C (92.5F) last July, its hottest for more than a century. Yet, at a reindeer corral outside \u2013 one could almost say inside \u2013 the city of Lule\u00e5, it\u2019s also evident how some of the \u201cgreen\u201d infrastructure projects that are intended as solutions to climate breakdown are also making the herding lifestyle harder by taking away grazing land.\\nThe weather this year has led him and neighbouring herders to graze their deer on the most southerly tips of their territories: the ice-bound islands just outside the city. Today\u2019s corral is taking place right by the airport, a short drive from the city\u2019s main retail park. \u201cBecause of industrialisation and deforestation, we have no other land to go to,\u201d he says as we drive to inspect the deer. \u201cSo we need to take this last part, that is close to the big cities.\u201d The decision has paid off. \u201cReally nice reindeer, healthy and fat,\u201d he says approvingly as we stand in a swirling mass of deer, grunting and jangling with bells.\\nOf the five areas where his reindeer go to calve, three, he says, are threatened by planned wind parks. \u201cThe reindeer will for sure not stay there when they have their calves, because that is when they are most afraid,\u201d he says, citing a study from a Swedish agricultural university. It found that reindeer tend to keep at least 5km away from a wind turbine. They mistake shadows from the blades for passing eagles, he claims.\\n\u201cThis is land where my family have been since the iron age, and now, a windfarm with a life of about 25 to 30 years can force me from land where my ancestor put a name to all the mountains, to every river, and every creek.\u201d\n \u201cIndustry is industry, whether it\u2019s green or not. It\u2019s the same,\u201d he tells me, once he has finished scanning the markings on the deers\u2019 ears to ascertain that none are his. \u201cThe ordinary industry took some land, but the green industry wants to take even more, and we have no more land to spare. We have already passed the limit.\u201d\n Sweden\u2019s green steel projects, he says, will need to be fed by new iron ore mines, such as G\u00e1llok ; all the so-called green industrial projects will require a massive increase in production of renewable electricity, meaning ever more wind turbines.\\nM\u00e4rta Stenevi, one of the two leaders of Sweden\u2019s Green party, acknowledges Sweden\u2019s \u201cshameful history of structural racism and discrimination of the Sami people\u201d, but she believes a new \u201cconsultation law for issues which affect the Sami people\u201d, which her party campaigned for and which came into force this March, can help solve the problem.\\n\u201cSweden\u2019s green transition can take place together with the Sami and not at their expense,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has to be done in close dialogue with the Sami so that locations can be found where it has the absolute least impact on nature, on the environment and on the Sami way of life.\u201d\\nAs the short spring day comes to an end, the young herders take a break to cook salted suovas \u2013 reindeer meat \u2013 over a fire and chatter about their night out in Lule\u00e5.\\nWhen I relay Stenevi\u2019s thoughts to Henrik Andersson, he snorts. \u201cWherever you put windmills, we lose grazing land, so whatever they say, there cannot be any cooperation. There can maybe be small parks on the edge of a mine or far out to sea, but not these big machines, that is impossible.\u201d\\nCrucially, the new law does not grant the Sami any veto rights, so Andersson doubts it will do much to help him in his battles against forest clearcuts and windfarms. \u201cWe need to have a veto,\u201d he says. \u201cTo be able to say no.\u201d\\nThat the Forest Rebellion activists have set up their tent a 15-minute ski away from the Greenpeace house reflects a somewhat uneasy relationship between the campaigners even if they are united on the plight of the Sami. The charismatic Litvinov, with his stream of enthralling war stories from 33 years with Greenpeace, calls the Forest Rebellion group \u201cthe anarchists\u201d, ridiculing them for their endless meetings, obsession with consensus and supposed lack of any clear strategy.\\nThey in turn seem wary of being pulled entirely into his orbit. \u201cYou don\u2019t like me!\u201d he says in mock exasperation, throwing his hands in the air, when asking them why they don\u2019t come to the house more. \u201cNo Dima,\u201d Olsson shoots back. \u201cYou don\u2019t like us.\u201d Even so, a few days later, Litvinov hands the house over to the activists.\\nThey all agree that \u201cgreen industry\u201d is a contradiction in terms. \u201cThey want us to believe that the same industry that put us into the environmental crisis is going to get us out of it,\u201d Litvinov says, as we watch the reindeer herders.\\n\u201cAs long as we\u2019re continuing to be stuck in a system of continuous growth and continuous economic extraction of resources, we\u2019re still going to be going down.\u201d", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/345752c2b41088ec815e4f6efb7afc510555cbe9/0_209_4377_2626/master/4377.jpg?width=480&dpr=1&s=none", "Reindeer herd near \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, northern Sweden."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df4de6decb681d2ece1180222232c2278e63d521/0_381_3141_1885/master/3141.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Activists at the Forest Rebellion protest camp\u2019s tent near Kangos, Sweden.

A video from one site showed a campaigner using a small window-breaking hammer to smash the glass on one pump, and spraying the broken dial with orange spray paint.\\n\u201cToday\u2019s action is a significant escalation after 10 Just Stop Oil supporters were arrested yesterday outside Kingsbury oil terminal [in Warwickshire] whilst standing peacefully on a grass verge with placards,\u201d the campaign said in a statement.\\n\u201cSince 1 April, when supporters of Just Stop Oil first began blocking oil terminals, there have been over 1,000 arrests.

On Wednesday, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, promised the government would \u201cstop at nothing\u201d to prevent such protests, and said fuel distribution had not been significantly affected.\\nA spokesperson for Surrey police said: \u201cWe are currently dealing with two groups of protesters who turned up earlier this morning at Clacket Lane and Cobham services. Officers were called around 7.02am following reports that a group of protesters had turned up at Clacket Lane and were gluing themselves to pumps and signs on the petrol station forecourts. They were also blocking access to the pumps.\\n\u201cA further call was received around 7.06am that protesters were on site at Cobham services petrol station and were damaging the pumps. One of the protesters had also glued himself to the top of a lorry. The pumps have all been switched off and motorists are being diverted away from both service stations.\u201d\\nDespite the disruption, and negative coverage from rightwing papers and broadcasters, Just Stop Oil said their protests were encouraging others to take action over the climate crisis.\\nAccording to new polling, the proportion of people in the UK who said they were likely to engage in some form of climate action increased from 8.7% to 11.3% in the first three weeks of their campaign, equivalent to about 1.7 million adults.

But can therapists make a difference and is seeking treatment just a form of denial?\\n\\nPete Knapp, 36, who lives in London, has visited North Korea, travelled overland from Kenya to Cape Town, motorcycled through Japan and Cambodia and trekked by horse through China. Until a few years ago, \u201cI felt invincible,\u201d he says. He had never experienced anxiety, or worried about the climate crisis.\\nThen, in 2019, he went to Borneo. \u201cI remember flying in one of those small planes over a part of Borneo that used to be rainforest but is now a palm oil plantation. The whole landscape was this monoculture,\u201d he says. He spent days trying to find orangutans in the wild, and, when he finally found the primary rainforest that remained, he saw \u201csuch depth, character, colour and variety\u201d that he felt horrified by the \u201cquiet, dead, grey, nothingness\u201d replacing it. \u201cIt hammered home how our lifestyles and diets had caused so much destruction to this part of the world that is so precious. When you go to a supermarket and buy food, you don\u2019t see the cost of it. That was the first time I saw the cost.\u201d It marked the end of his travels and feeling of invincibility, and the beginning of what he now calls climate anxiety.\\nThis emotional state includes feelings as varied as fear and helplessness, guilt, shame, loss, betrayal and abandonment, and it can take different shapes in each individual. Anouchka Grose, a psychoanalyst and the author of A Guide to Eco-Anxiety, How to Protect the Planet and Your Mental Health, says some patients describe staying awake all night thinking of coral reefs, bush fires and ice caps melting. Some might \u201cwalk into a shop and freak out because they suddenly see it as it is,\u201d how \u201call the things in front of you are in damaging forms of packaging, freighted from goodness knows where, covered in pesticides\u201d. In her book, someone describes looking at a friend\u2019s take-away coffee: \u201cIt makes me sad and alarmed, imagining millions of people out there, just like him, with one throwaway plastic cup, millions of times over every day.\u201d\\nFor Knapp, it was the feeling of having \u201cthe rug pulled from under my feet; that I was enjoying a life that was ruining the world\u201d. For Natasha James, 33, a training manager in Portsmouth, it was reading article after article in a paralysing spiral: \u201cIt would get to the stage where I would freeze.\u201d Their climate anxiety began at 12, when their science teacher spoke about the hole in the ozone layer and global heating. \u201cI remember my stomach dropped, and I thought, \u2018Oh, my God! I\u2019ve never heard about this before; why are people not talking about it? Why are we not doing anything about it?\u2019\u201d.\\nMolecular biologist Abi Perrin, 32, describes the physical sensations she experienced after reading the 2018 report by the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): \u201cMy heart was pounding. My chest felt tight every time I thought about it \u2013 and I couldn\u2019t not think about it. I\u2019d often burst into tears because it felt overwhelming. It\u2019s like a pit in your stomach \u2013 you feel weirdly empty. It\u2019s not always the same, but it sometimes takes the form of feeling very sad, hopeless and alone.\u201d\\nThe biggest ever scientific study on climate anxiety and young people, published last year in the Lancet, found that nearly six in 10 people aged 16 to 25 were very or extremely worried about climate breakdown, nearly half of them reported climate distress or anxiety affecting their daily lives, and three-quarters agreed that \u201cthe future is frightening\u201d. All the therapists I spoke to reported seeing a significant increase in climate anxiety in their consulting rooms. So, can therapy help?\\nThere is a danger, in suggesting that therapy might help, of pathologising climate anxiety; turning it into a mental health problem that needs to be cured \u2013 medicated or spirited away with mindfulness or talking therapy . Many people I interviewed were faced with such reactions from friends, family, colleagues, GPs, and, occasionally, even therapists.\\nThis is not how the author of Psychological Roots of the Climate Crisis Sally Weintrobe thinks. \u201cIt is important to say that anxiety is a signal that there is something wrong. It\u2019s a perfectly normal healthy reaction to a worrying situation. We mustn\u2019t pathologise climate anxiety. Obviously it can get very extreme \u2013 but I would say that government inaction on the climate crisis is pretty extreme, so it\u2019s hardly surprising that people are very worried.\u201d What Knapp, James and Perrin said helped them most was having their emotions validated in therapy \u2013 and understanding that their feelings were meaningful and valuable.\\nCaroline Hickman, a psychotherapist, climate psychology researcher and board member of the Climate Psychology Alliance, says, \u201cI would worry about people who aren\u2019t distressed \u2013 given that this is what is happening, how come?\u201d She believes that people are using psychological defences such as denial \u201cas a way of coping and reducing the fear that they feel\u201d. This can leave the climate-anxious with a sense of isolation, frustration and abandonment, as others tell themselves, \u201cOh, well, the government will save us; technology will save us; if it was that bad, somebody would have done something,\u201d she says. \u201cThose are all rationalisations against existential terror of annihilation \u2013 and that\u2019s the reality of what we\u2019re potentially looking at.\u201d\\nTo face this reality is to come out of what Weintrobe calls \u201cthe climate bubble\u201d, which, she says, \u201chas been supported by a culture of uncare, a culture that actively seeks to keep us in a state of denial about the severity of the climate crisis\u201d. She explains: \u201cThe bubble protects you from reality, and when you start seeing the reality, it\u2019s hardly surprising that you\u2019re going to experience a whole series of shocks.\u201d She prefers the term climate trauma over anxiety because \u201cit is traumatising to see that you are caught up in a way of living, whether you like it or not, that makes you a victim and a perpetrator of damaging the Earth, which is what keeps us all alive\u201d. We are living, she says, \u201cin a political system that generates a mental health crisis, because it places burdens on people that are too much to bear, as well as burdens on the Earth\u201d.\\nThe thing about trauma is that it can reignite earlier, individual trauma. That experience of coming out of the climate bubble and having your worries dismissed, of realising that you have been abandoned by people who were supposed to look after you, can be particularly triggering. For Weintrobe, this is where therapy can have a role to play, \u201cin helping people to disentangle what is personal to them and their own individual histories, from what is hitting them from the outside\u201d.\\nPerrin describes how speaking to her therapist helped in ways she didn\u2019t expect. She says: \u201cHaving that space to have those conversations and be honest about how I felt was really valuable. I went into it thinking I wanted practical advice about how to solve this, but that was not what I got and not what I needed. It helped me to understand that what I was feeling was not wrong.\u201d It also helped her to get a better sense of her anxiety: \u201cI think it might come from feeling lots of things and not actually understanding what they are.\u201d She still experiences anxiety, but it doesn\u2019t escalate in the way it did before. \u201cI know that it\u2019s rooted in something real, and that even if the situation doesn\u2019t change, the intensity of that feeling can, and will, pass.\u201d\\nAs a climate-anxious pupil at school, James was told that this feeling was \u201cirrational\u201d by the therapist they saw at the time. It was while reading article after article late at night that James landed on one about climate anxiety, and recognised their own experience. They decided to try treatment again, and contacted Patrick Kennedy-Williams. First, they say, he told them their fears were valid and rational. Then they discussed how to get a better balance of climate news by also reading positive stories about people who are taking action, as well as limiting internet access on their phone.\\nThis brings to mind how, in her climate-aware therapeutic work, Hickman draws on her experience, in the 1990s, of treating young people, who were HIV positive, with about a year to live. A significant number were, through therapy, \u201cable to change their relationship with their diagnosis and not just live in fear of death, but learn to live their lives wholeheartedly, with death as part of it,\u201d she says. They left relationships that were unsatisfactory, left jobs that they hated, and \u201cthey learned to live their lives fully and with meaning, not in denial that their lives might be shorter, but that that didn\u2019t have to define their lives \u2013 it was just part of it\u201d.\\nIt is perhaps surprising to hear Weintrobe \u2013 a psychoanalyst \u2013 say that while there is a role for therapy in addressing climate anxiety, it is limited. We need to normalise this distress, she says, but not by pretending it\u2019s not there, or shouldn\u2019t be. \u201cIt\u2019s very perverse that normalising has come to mean getting rid of anything that\u2019s disturbing. Can we make it normal that we are very disturbed and bothered by what is going on, and help each other?\u201d She recommends meeting to talk in groups about climate anxiety, such as at the climate cafes run by the Climate Psychology Alliance. Hickman runs psycho-educational groups with youth activists to address the impact of the climate crisis on mental health, where they discuss ways to support themselves and each other.\\nElouise Mayall, 24, and living in Canterbury, is a master\u2019s student in ecology and a climate activist with the UK Youth Climate Coalition who has taken part in Hickman\u2019s groups and workshops. Her climate anxiety began when she left university and realised how unconcerned others were \u2013 what she calls leaving the \u201cgreen bubble\u201d. In her 20s, she felt intense pressure, guilt, shame and anxiety to produce less and do everything to make up for what others were not doing. After joining UKYCC, her anxiety started to improve, through being part of a community. She says that Hickman\u2019s workshops have helped her and her colleagues to recognise \u201cthe emotional strain\u201d of the work they do, and to learn to rest. They are now far more \u201cmindful of each other\u2019s mental health\u201d, and people don\u2019t feel guilty when they need a break, so are less likely to \u201ccrash and burnout\u201d.\\nMayall has also developed a different relationship with her climate anxiety. Previously, she says, \u201cI was very dismissive and grumpy about having it. I wanted to suppress it or get rid of it \u2013 I thought it was an indulgence because people are dying, so why was I fussing around with feelings?\u201d She felt she should be happy all the time. Now, she recognises that \u201cit isn\u2019t bad, wrong, or inconvenient for me to have climate anxiety, because it ultimately means that I care about the climate crisis\u201d. She uses an ecological metaphor to describe how she relates to her feelings now: \u201cBiodiversity is important because the more complex an ecosystem is, the more stable it is, and the more resilient it is to any disturbances or damage that comes along\u201d. A monoculture, such as the one Knapp saw from that plane in Borneo, makes for a very fragile ecosystem; the same is true of an emotional monoculture. Allowing herself to experience whatever emotions she is feeling, including guilt and shame, has brought her a kind of emotional biodiversity, and a more sustainable way of life.\\nSince starting therapy James has attended a climate cafe, signed up to workshops, written to their local MP and published articles online to spread awareness.\\nPerrin says therapy has helped her support herself and other activists. She is now researching microscopic algae, and their potential to help us live more sustainably.\\nAfter what he saw in Borneo, and his research into the apocalyptic impact of climate breakdown, Knapp\u2019s view of the world and of his future collapsed. He felt betrayed by the government, and despairing of the inaction of those around him. He became increasingly isolated and, for a time, suicidal. He found a way out of this by joining Extinction Rebellion, where friends recommended a therapist. He has since changed his life, becoming a researcher in air quality and a climate activist, giving up his beloved Mini, going vegan and making a podcast with fellow activists about how they cope with climate anxiety and what inspires them . He hasn\u2019t been on a plane since.\\nThese stories recall a comment from Grose, that the word \u201canxious\u201d has two definitions: one can feel anxious due to a nebulous fear, or one can be anxious to do something \u2013 to be willing to act, with urgency.\\nAs I researched this article, I noticed an intensifying feeling of unease and tension. Last week, the IPCC reported that it is \u201cnow or never\u201d if we are to stave off climate disaster, and the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, warned: \u201cSome government and business leaders are saying one thing \u2013 but doing another. Simply put, they are lying. And the results will be catastrophic.\u201d I know I need to read the report, to see the scientific reality of where we are, but I am not, yet, able to. I am frightened to leave the climate bubble. I tell Weintrobe about my anxious feelings, and she says reporters often phone her and say, \u201cI feel overwhelmed, being a climate journalist.\u201d I find her next words strangely hopeful. \u201cI feel overwhelmed, too. Sometimes, I find myself lying on the sofa, unable to move because it\u2019s all so worrying. But you get out of it, and you carry on.\u201d\\nIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Extinction Rebellion wants governments to declare a climate emergency and rapidly cut emissions to zero by 2025 while Fireproof Australia\u2019s goals are more immediate.\\nCoCo says the group wants a permanent, Australian-based air tanker fleet to fight bushfires, smoke-proof schools, aged care and disability centres to protect the vulnerable, and an immediate plan to rehome flood and fire survivors.\\nSome commentators who support urgent action on the climate crisis have criticised direct action tactics as counterproductive, warning they may alienate the very people who need to be persuaded. Writing in the Nine newspapers last month, the social researcher Rebecca Huntley said people who were \u201cdisengaged, uncertain or sceptical\u201d were less likely to listen to someone who was making it harder for them to get to work.\\n\u201cIn the qualitative research I have done, groups such as Extinction Rebellion come up in conversation in a very negative way and can be a barrier to talking about global warming and how climate action might actually improve their lives,\u201d Huntley wrote.\\nBut CoCo says every other attempt to get governments to act has failed.\\n\u201cWe tried,\u201d CoCo says. \u201cWe tried protesting to the politicians. We\u2019ve tried one-day marches. Nothing happened. And so now we need to escalate these disruptive tactics.\u201d\\nThe group is often associated with Blockade Australia, whose members obstruct physical infrastructure such as rail lines or cranes, although the two groups are separate.\\nBlockade Australia\u2019s membership is drawn from several campaigns, including Rising Tide, which targeted the coal industry in Newcastle, and anti-Adani protesters from Queensland.\\nThe group\u2019s first major action was obstructing coal trains at Newcastle, the largest coal port in the world in November 2021, prompting an attack from Barnaby Joyce, who said $60m in exports had been lost in one week.\\nIn recent weeks the group has targeted Port Botany in Sydney, Australia\u2019s largest container port, which led to the arrest of Maxim Curmi, who was jailed for four months after he scaled a 60m crane.\\nUnlike other groups, Blockade Australia has no specific goals. Maddie, a spokesperson who declined to give her surname citing the risk of arrest, says it is focused on \u201cbuilding momentum\u201d as it \u201cdoesn\u2019t see any worth in appealing to the goodwill of a system that doesn\u2019t have any\u201d.\\nThe hurried NSW legislation in response to the street and industry blockades has been branded a \u201cdraconian\u201d attempt to criminalise the right to protest by 40 civil society groups, including the NSW and Act Aboriginal Legal Service, the NSW Council for Civil Liberties, Human Rights Law Centre, Environmental Defenders Office and Australian Democracy Network.\\nPiero Moraro, a lecturer in criminology at Edith Cowan University who studies civil disobedience, says the right to protest can simply be restrained to \u201cwaving flags under the eyes of the police\u201d.\\nAs much as governments and commentators may cast militant or disruptive protest groups as troublemakers and even criminals, Moraro says they can drive change thanks to the \u201cradical flank effect\u201d.\\n\u201cIt is a reference to Martin Luther King,\u201d Moraro says. \u201cOne reason why he was successful is that you also had the Black Panthers.

Nonviolent resistance now, or the unthinkable violence of climate change later.\\n\u201cThere is a need to break the law,\u201d says Just Stop Oil\u2019s Melissa Carrington, \u201cso we are not guilty of greater crime.\u201d But is she right?\\nIn so-called liberal democracies, we have a default obligation to obey the law. It\u2019s a moral duty, as well as a legal one. It\u2019s part of our implicit contract with the government we elected,which provides us, in return, with the protection of justice. But what happens when that government doesn\u2019t keep its side of the bargain?\\nThen, according to numerous political thinkers, we not only can, but very possibly should, break some laws: peacefully, publicly and on principle. The aim? To bring policy into line with what justice actually requires.\\nHenry David Thoreau gave this a name: civil disobedience. John Rawls, as pivotal a social contract thinker as you are likely to find, thought it could be good for social stability and justice, so long as it challenged longstanding, serious injustice. And what could be more unjust than supporting an industry that kills people?\\nWe can be more or less controversial here. Is civil disobedience morally OK because governments aren\u2019t progressive enough when it comes to protecting non-humans? Because they allow sentient animals to be tortured in factory farms, or 30% of species to be wiped out by the climate crisis? Some philosophers, such as Peter Singer, think so. Our fellow animals, they say, are entitled to political consideration even though they can\u2019t participate in democratic decision-making.\\nOthers point out, less provocatively, that although a government is mainly answerable to those living within its own borders, it still owes basic justice to other humans. It shouldn\u2019t give them encephalitis or dengue fever, or starve them to death.\\nThere are grounds for disobedience even if we think only about what governments should and shouldn\u2019t do to their own citizens. The climate crisis threatens our children and grandchildren with heatwaves, floods, wildfires, and untold mental anguish. By propping up the fossil fuel industry, our government puts their whole future in jeopardy. If that\u2019s not a serious injustice, I\u2019m not sure what is.\\nThen there\u2019s environmental resistance. Rather than grabbing attention through general disruption, the activists aim to prevent injustice, directly. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like sitting in the middle of random roads,\u201d says Zak, a 15-year-old activist who was arrested as part of the Just Stop Oil protests. \u201cAs well as saying to the government, \u2018We are demanding no new oil and gas extraction in the North Sea\u2019, it is also stopping the gears of production.\u201d\\nIs this better, or worse? The philosophers Ten-Herng Lai and Chong-Ming Lim think it\u2019s fairer to inconvenience oil and gas giants than the general public, because they\u2019re the ones doing the harm. Or think about it like this. If activists focus on preventing states from extracting oil or natural gas, they might do something else as well: challenge government overreach.\\n\u201cSome philosophers question whether territorial rights should extend to underground natural resources,\u201d says Megan Blomfield, a senior lecturer at the University of Sheffield, \u201csince it\u2019s not like anybody did anything to put them there. And where the resource is scarce or its use can harm other people, there\u2019s additional reason to question any entitlement for the state to do what it likes with it.\u201d\\nOf course, caveats remain. Is this mass law-breaking a last resort? It looks like it. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has been issuing warnings for 32 years now, but states\u2019 commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions fall abysmally short of limiting global warming to 1.5C. Actual policies put us on track for a terrifying 2.7C increase by 2100, and the UK shows no sign of doing its fair share.\\nAnd will it work? It might, if the numbers are right. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen through history that the only way mass change is achieved is through these mass campaigns like the women\u2019s suffrage or the civil rights movements,\u201d says Zak.\\nIt makes sense to diversify tactics. Just activism should be inclusive, and risking arrest is only a viable strategy for the comparatively privileged, not those already at the receiving end of police intimidation. There\u2019s also evidence that successful movements use a range of approaches, from lobbying and voting to strikes and, yes, civil disobedience.\\nBut social scientists Maria Stephan and Erica Chenoweth studied major resistance campaigns between 1900 and 2006 and found that the nonviolent ones succeeded more than half the time. (More than twice as often, incidentally, as the violent ones.) The key to success? The so-called \u201c3.5% rule\u201d, because that\u2019s the proportion of the population that needs to get involved.\\nAnd here\u2019s something else to bear in mind. These movements also challenge participatory injustice, where those with most at stake are excluded from decision-making. Many climate protesters are too young to vote. They are denied a voice in determining their own future, while politicians accept gifts worth millions from climate sceptics and fossil fuel interests. Through activism, including civil disobedience, they demand to be heard.\\nWhen future generations look back on this period, as we look back on earlier epoch-defining campaigns, they\u2019ll ask who showed more respect for justice and democracy: the activists so many of us find disruptive, or the governments they are trying to reform. I think we know what their answer will be.\\nElizabeth Cripps is a writer and moral philosopher, and the author of What Climate Justice Means and Why We Should Care", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e135e071441693c87e5c14584ef19f26e7f86589/0_202_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Just Stop Oil activists blockade the Kingsbury oil terminal in Warwickshire, 3 April 2022."]], "author": ["Elizabeth Cripps"], "date": "2022-04-12"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/01/environmental-protesters-block-oil-terminals-across-england": {"title": "Environmental protesters block oil terminals across UK", "subtitle": null, "text": "Activists climb on tankers and glue themselves to roads around London, Birmingham and Southampton\\nHundreds of environmental protesters have blocked 10 oil terminals across the country as part of a campaign to paralyse the UK\u2019s fossil fuel infrastructure.\\nEarly on Friday, supporters of Just Stop Oil began blockades at oil refineries around London, Birmingham and Southampton by climbing on top of tankers and gluing themselves to road surfaces.\\nShortly after 4am, activists blocked terminals in Purfleet and Grays, Essex, which they said were the biggest in the country.

Outside Kingsbury and on roads leading to the site, posters said: \u201cTemporary high court injunction in force.

This was followed at 6.30am by a further action at Inter Terminals in Grays, Essex, where about 40 people swarmed into the facility, climbed the loading bay pipework and locked on, they claimed.\\n\u201cIt is expected that this morning\u2019s actions will continue to significantly impact on fuel availability at petrol pumps across the south-east and the Midlands,\u201d the group said on its 10th day of action demanding that the UK government end new oil and gas projects in the UK.\\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are aware that protest activity at some oil terminals has led to short-term disruptions to fuel deliveries over the past few days. The local police forces are working with the industry to ensure that fuel supplies can be maintained.\u201d\\nIn an interview on the Sunday Morning show on BBC One, Lucas said: \u201cI am sorry that it has come to this and that this is the only way that people feel they can make their voices heard.\\n\u201cThe International Energy Agency says that \u2026 the latest IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] report says that, and yet this government and this energy strategy \u2026 is foreseeing getting out even more oil and gas from the North Sea.

But it emerged this week that Earth Negotiations Bulletin (ENB), a division of the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), which has covered previous ISA negotiations, had not had its contract renewed.\\nWhile the ISA negotiations are filmed live via webcam, the absence of ENB \u2013 which would have created a permanent independent record of proceedings \u2013 was described as a \u201chuge loss\u201d for stakeholders.\\nSome states, including Germany, are also concerned that the ISA is developing its mining standards and guidelines behind closed doors, and that current knowledge of deep-sea ecosystems and the potential effects of mining on the marine environment are insufficient to allow it to go ahead.\\nScientists have warned that the damage to ecosystems from mining nickel, cobalt and other metals on the deep-seabed would be \u201cdangerous\u201d, \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cirreversible\u201d. One estimate suggests that 90% of the deep-sea species that researchers encounter are new to science.\\nAs opposition to deep-sea mining grows, the ISA is facing resistance over its rush to develop a roadmap to be adopted before 9 July 2023. The plan was prompted in June last year, when the island of Nauru informed the ISA of its intention to start mining the seabed in two years\u2019 time, via a subsidiary of a Canadian firm, The Metals Company (TMC, until recently known as DeepGreen Metals). This invoked an obscure clause of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which said the ISA must finalise regulations within two years of such an announcement.\\nGoogle, BMW, Volvo and Samsung SDI, a battery subsidiary of the electronics firm, have joined a World Wildlife Fund call for a moratorium on mining the deep sea, which will affect the potential market for deep-sea minerals used for car and smartphone batteries.\\nThe ISA said ENB\u2019s contract was not renewed due to budget cuts. The IISD, meanwhile, said it was now fundraising to be able to cover the next round of negotiations in July. \u201cTransparency of the talks are important, especially for small islands and developing countries who can\u2019t always attend,\u201d said the IISD\u2019s Matthew TenBruggencate.\\nGermany and environmentalists also expressed concern over a lack of transparency by the ISA\u2019s legal and technical commission (LTC), a body charged with developing standards and guidelines for the mining code, which meets behind closed doors.\\nThe LTC comprises 30 members. A fifth of them work for contractors for deep-sea mining companies.\\nIn its opening remarks on the ISA\u2019s website, Germany highlighted the absence of stakeholders\u2019 comments, or marked-up changes in the LTC\u2019s draft standards and guidelines document.\\n\u201cIn order to be transparent and allow for a proper debate, a mark-up document as provided by the facilitator regarding the draft regulation would be very helpful for our negotiations,\u201d it said. \u201cTherefore, we suggest that the council request such a document.\u201d\\nGermany also said the mining code \u201cstill lacked binding and measurable normative requirements\u201d for marine protection. It argued that, because the current standards, guidelines and regulations do not yet contain \u201cspecific environmental minimal requirements\u201d for measurable pollution, sediment plumes, biodiversity, and noise and light impacts, the code as it stands would not regulate future mining effectively.\\n\u201cThe current state of knowledge is, in our view, insufficient to proceed to exploiting mineral resources,\u201d it said.\\nIt supported the EU\u2019s formal position that marine minerals \u201ccannot be exploited before the effects of deep-sea mining on the marine environment, biodiversity and human activities have been sufficiently researched, the risks are understood and technologies and operational practices are able to demonstrate that the environment is not seriously harmed, in line with the precautionary principle\u201d.\\nOther states, including Belgium, the Netherlands, Costa Rica and Chile, adopted similarly precautionary approaches, highlighting the gulf in scientific knowledge of the deep sea.\\nOn the other hand the UK, which is no longer part of the EU, has been pushing ahead for rapid development of regulations, according to observers.\\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the UK government was engaging in ISA negotiations to ensure that high environmental standards were adopted in deep-sea mining regulations. \u201cAny ongoing conversations in support of this should not be interpreted as support for deep-sea mining,\u201d a spokesperson said.\\nDuncan Currie, an international lawyer with the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, which is tracking the negotiations, said he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d by the various failures of transparency.\\n\u201cThere is no transparency of the LTC, who meet behind closed doors. It sounds like an innocuous body, but it is in essence the decision-making body within the ISA.\u201d\\nCurrie wants to see a moratorium on deep-sea mining, akin to that set up by the Antarctic protocol. \u201cThe whole area of deep-sea mining is a political, scientific and political minefield. There should be a moratorium put in place.\u201d\\nAlso missing from the proposed standards and guidelines was the possibility not to continue with mining.\\nGreenpeace, an observer at the talks, called for reform of the ISA\u2019s secretariat, which it accused of bias towards allowing mining to take place, to the detriment of the environment.\\n\u201cThere are a herd of elephants in the room,\u201d said Arlo Hemphill, an oceans campaigner for Greenpeace USA. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough time to get it right, and there is not the science to get it right.\u201d\\nIn a statement in response, the ISA said it was entrusted by its membership, which comprises 167 member states and the EU, to take necessary measures to protect the marine environment from harmful effects that may arise from deep-seabed mineral-related activities, and that regulations governing exploration of the seabed had been adopted.\\n\u201cThe challenge now is to make the transition to exploitation, which must reflect best international standards and practices as well as agreed principles of sustainable development,\u201d it said. \u201cThe exploitation regulations will be formally adopted once all 168 members of the ISA reach consensus on its content.\u201d\\n\u201cThe ISA is committed to ensuring transparency in pursuit of this goal,\u201d it added. \u201cWhilst budget cuts, imposed by the ISA\u2019s members, meant that Earth Negotiations Bulletin\u2019s contract could not be renewed due to the cost, the ISA is streaming the meetings live in six languages to ensure that transparency is maintained.\u201d\\nIt said the ISA\u2019s legal and technical commission was comprised of specialists elected by member states: \u201cIt is not unusual for technical bodies such as this to meet in private and, in any case, the discussions and recommendations of the commission are publicly recorded in the chair\u2019s report to the council following each meeting\u201d.\\nThis article was amended on 7 April 2022 to include a response from the ISA that was omitted due to a misunderstanding.

One local paper in Berkshire found that five of 11 it rang were either out of or low on fuel. Simon Williams, a fuel spokesperson for the RAC, told the Mirror: \u201cProtests at fuel terminals over the last two weekends have led to some forecourts in the south-east running out of fuel due to planned deliveries being disrupted.\\n\u201cWhile this is obviously an inconvenience at one of the busiest times of the year drivers should easily be able to find fuel.

Dorian Lynskey followed them in the weeks leading up to last week\u2019s action\\nIn a flat in east London, on the night of 31 March, two dozen people in their early 20s are packing sleeping bags and energy bars and discussing unorthodox toilet arrangements. There are bowls of vegan curry on the table and a Fontaines DC gig on the television. You might assume that they were going to a music festival, if not for the foldable ladders. In fact, they are all members of the new campaign group Just Stop Oil, which is demanding the cessation of all new oil licences in the UK. Their plan is to bring traffic in and out of the Navigator oil terminal in Thurrock, Essex, to a grinding halt a few hours from now. From the window of the flat they can see Navigator\u2019s vast white silos. \u201cI saw it earlier and my stomach flipped,\u201d says Hannah Hunt, a 23-year-old from Brighton. She calls it \u201cthe venue\u201d.\\nHunt is a veteran of Just Stop Oil\u2019s precursors, Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain. In recent months she has delivered a letter containing Just Stop Oil\u2019s demands to No 10 Downing Street, scaled the Fawley oil refinery in Southampton, and glued herself to the red carpet at the Bafta awards. She experiences anxiety before an action but once it\u2019s happening, she enters \u201ca weird, dreamy, calm mindset. It\u2019s really empowering.\u201d\\nAnother prematurely seasoned activist is Louis McKechnie, who served half of a three-month term in jail for blocking the M25 and recently tied himself to a goalpost during a match between Everton and Newcastle. He\u2019s a confident 21-year-old with curtained hair and large glasses. During his pitch invasion, Twitter users compared him to John Lennon and Paul Dano\u2019s Riddler in The Batman. Most of the activists \u2013 members of the Youth Climate Swarm \u2013 have never been arrested before. \u201cToday will be arrest number 16 for me,\u201d McKechnie says after a legal briefing, \u201cso if you have any questions, I\u2019ll be here all night.\u201d\\nAfter dinner, she produces a map and holds an action meeting for a sub-group of 10. The plan rests on the \u201csite-take team\u201d blocking all transit in and out of the terminal by scaling the tankers and camping out there, which makes it illegal for the driver to move the vehicle. It\u2019s a difficult, stressful thing they are about to do but the mood is surprisingly festive. When Hunt asks them to shout out their primary and secondary roles in the action, there are giggles. \u201cBack and top!\u201d \u201cBush and top!\u201d When Insulate Britain blockaded motorways last autumn, each action was over in less than an hour but it takes a specialist police team to remove people from high places. The idea is to stay up there for days on end.\\nSleep is minimal. Preparations don\u2019t wrap up until 1am and the activists have to rise again at 2.30am. As they wait for a minibus on a street corner in the bitter cold, Hunt convenes a trust circle. \u201cI trust myself, I trust you, I trust the group,\u201d they recite. On the bus, they switch to whimsical nature-based codenames such as Broccoli and Meadow. They talk about their nerves, and about making history.\\nAt around 4am, the minibus pulls up a little way from the terminal. The activists disembark and scurry through the roadside undergrowth towards the entrance. Suddenly, the flashing lights of a police car jangle the night. They\u2019ve been expected. They think for a moment that it\u2019s game over. But they press on. Three activists sit down in front of the first tanker and unfurl an orange banner reading JUST STOP OIL. Twenty-year-old Pavel Ivanov takes the role of de-escalator, talking to drivers and the police. Everyone else clambers on to one of three tankers. It all takes maybe two minutes.\\nAfter a while, a police officer approaches the second tanker and tries to reason the occupiers down. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to raise awareness of the climate emergency,\u201d says one, lean and bearded.\\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s aware,\u201d the officer protests.\\nThe activist shrugs. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between awareness and action.\u201d\\nOne Monday night in March, Roger Hallam is talking about the end of the world as we know it. The Leaf Hall community arts centre in Eastbourne was founded by the evangelical Christian and temperance campaigner William Leaf in 1863, so it is an apt venue for a man with the air of an apocalyptic prophet. Wiry and intense, with a greying beard and ponytail, the 55-year-old is well suited to the role of climate Jeremiah. \u201cPeople are suddenly going, \u2018This is it. This is the end,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBecause it is. There are ends. And it will happen unless we stop it. That\u2019s the way it is in 2022.\u201d\\nThirty purple plastic chairs have been laid out but only 13 are occupied. \u201cThat\u2019s totally predictable,\u201d Hallam says. \u201cMost people don\u2019t want to do things.\u201d\\nHallam speaks for more than an hour without notes. He opens by quoting a speech by Sir David King, formerly the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser and special envoy on climate change: \u201cWhat we do over the next three to four years, I believe, is going to determine the future of humanity. We are in a very, very desperate situation.\u201d That was one year ago. Hallam says that it is already too late to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5C. He predicts hundreds of millions of climate refugees by 2030, and worse. \u201cMass slaughter, mass rape, mass starvation,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s coming down the line.\u201d\\nHallam likes to say that he is \u201cjust a farmer from Wales\u201d, or at least he used to be. He blames the collapse of his organic farming business on a series of extreme weather events several years ago. Later he researched the history of civil disobedience for a PhD at King\u2019s College London. In 2018, he co-founded Extinction Rebellion (XR), which opened a new chapter in climate activism, based on civil disobedience and mass arrests, and took off in dozens of countries. But he is a divisive figure, as a recent documentary about XR Rebellion, shows, and was \u201cunreservedly denounced\u201d by Extinction Rebellion UK for describing the Holocaust as \u201cjust another fuckery in human history\u201d in a 2019 interview. I am told that he is merely an \u201cadviser\u201d to Just Stop Oil.\\nIt is a surreal and disturbing experience to sit in a hall in a seaside town on a quiet Monday evening and listen to someone tell you that human civilisation is destined to collapse within your lifetime and not be able to say with any confidence that he is wrong. Hallam\u2019s doomsday rhetoric might sometimes overshoot urgency and plunge into despair but consider the recent news items that have been overshadowed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The IPCC published a new report on the \u201cirreversible\u201d effects of exceeding 1.5C: heatwaves, floods, droughts, famine. \u201cAny further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a livable future,\u201d said the IPCC\u2019s Hans-Otto P\u00f6rtner. Scientists at the University of Manchester urged oil and gas production to end completely in richer countries by 2034 and in poorer nations by 2050. In the Arctic and Antarctic, researchers recorded temperatures that were respectively 30C and 40C above seasonal norms. You could say that the activists who drop out of their careers and actively invite arrest are going to extremes, or you could say that they are responding rationally to an existential emergency.\\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that scaring people too much is a problem,\u201d the writer and environmentalist George Monbiot tells me. \u201cWe\u2019re not nearly scared enough, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re not acting. The complete decarbonisation of our economy is our only hope of avoiding systemic environmental collapse, and nothing like that is on the political agenda in the biggest economies.\u201d\\nAt conferences such as Cop26, governments pledge to reduce consumption of fossil fuels while continuing to license new production. It might seem as if anxiety over soaring fuel bills and sanctions on Russian oil and gas make Just Stop Oil\u2019s timing unfortunate, but Monbiot argues that these crises strengthen the case for ending reliance on financially and politically volatile sources of energy. \u201cWe can achieve energy independence from dictatorships and autocracies and independence from fossil fuels at the same time and by the same means,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat\u2019s not to like?\u201d\\nEastbourne is where I first meet Hannah Hunt, who delivers similar talks at universities and colleges, \u201cbut with a slightly softer touch than Roger\u2019s doom-and-gloom approach,\u201d she tells me later. The first time she saw one of Hallam\u2019s talks, two years ago, she came home with her boyfriend and cried for two hours. \u201cIt is a tough line,\u201d she says. \u201cSome people think, OK, we are travelling towards the end of human civilisation and therefore I must act. Some want to bury their heads in the sand. I have been in both places, and I am sometimes in both places still, so I have empathy for both of those reactions. I tell people to channel those emotions into your desire to act.\u201d\\nHunt tells the Eastbourne audience her own story. Growing up in the Lake District, she was always close to nature and sensitive to suffering on the news. \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to just stand by.\u201d She was studying clinical psychology at the University of Sussex and working on an NHS eating disorder service throughout the pandemic. \u201cSocietal breakdown is Covid times 100, for ever,\u201d she says. Last December, she dropped out of university to become a full-time activist.\\n\u201cI\u2019m 23,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThere are lots of other things I\u2019d rather be doing. But we don\u2019t have the luxury of time. We have in our house a countdown of how many days we\u2019ve got, which is really motivating but also quite depressing. I wouldn\u2019t be able to live with myself if I looked back in 10 years and I hadn\u2019t taken action.\u201d\\nAfter Hallam\u2019s talk, the audience breaks into two groups to discuss the new campaign. There are some doubts. \u201cI feel very often like I\u2019m pissing in the wind politically,\u201d says one woman who was part of the Greenham Common peace camp in the 1980s. Another veteran activist, with CND and Greenpeace, complains that Insulate Britain\u2019s strategy of blockading motorways last September was \u201ccounterproductive\u201d and says that she doesn\u2019t understand the relationship between XR, Insulate Britain and Just Stop Oil. It\u2019s a good question.\\nOne sunny afternoon three weeks later, I meet a 27-year-old Just Stop Oil organiser called Indigo Rumbelow on a bench in north London\u2019s Lloyd Park. Speaking with quiet intensity and great care, she describes the intersection of the three groups as a Venn diagram. Just Stop Oil was formed last December in order to rejuvenate and refocus the overall campaign. \u201cWhen you\u2019re reaching a dead end, the correct thing to do is go into a period of creation and experimentation in order to engage new people,\u201d Rumbelow says. She describes it as a non-hierarchical coalition of organisers, scientists, lawyers and former workers in the oil industry who collaborate on both demands and tactics. Activists then operate in autonomous blocs with shared resources but no formal leadership. All funding comes from donations. The goal is to raise awareness on a massive scale.\\n\u201cPeople have been writing petitions, going on marches, speaking to their MPs, joining NGOs, and it\u2019s not just staying the same, it\u2019s actually getting worse,\u201d Rumbelow says. \u201cPeople across society are really angry. We\u2019ve tried all the democratic means of creating that change so now the only thing we can do is civil disobedience. It is upsetting to disrupt people but it\u2019s far more upsetting to stay silent as we watch this horror unfold. If my brother woke me up because there was a fire in the middle of night, I wouldn\u2019t be angry that he woke me up.\u201d\\n\u201cIt could be described as the politics of desperation,\u201d George Monbiot says. \u201cThey\u2019re desperately trying to draw attention towards the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced, in a society that is almost constitutionally unable to face it. We can\u2019t leave them to do this on our behalf. We need to respond to our existential crisis with the biggest political mass movement there\u2019s ever been.\u201d\\nFive days after Roger Hallam\u2019s talk in Eastbourne, I attend a nonviolence training day in a room above a Methodist church in Leicester. Mya Baines (not her real name), a 34-year-old animator, and Karen Wildin, a 57-year-old private tutor, begin by asking the dozen or so attenders to introduce themselves. There is a vicar whose brother was arrested at an XR protest; a woman whose daughter dropped out of university after seeing Hallam speak; a rapper who admires Russell Brand. Baines then puts forward various scenarios and asks the group to say whether they qualify as violent, nonviolent or not being violent. The distinction is not always clear.\\n\u201cThere is no proactive word for nonviolence,\u201d writes Mark Kurlansky in Nonviolence: The History of a Dangerous Idea. Mahatma Gandhi coined the word satyagraha, or \u201ctruth force\u201d, to describe his version of it. Gandhi\u2019s example inspired Richard Gregg\u2019s 1934 book The Power of Nonviolence, and Gregg in turn became a guiding influence on the American civil rights activists who began staging anti-segregation sit-ins in the 1940s. Gregg, a Quaker lawyer, described the strategy as \u201cmoral jiu-jitsu\u201d: expecting physical resistance and receiving none, the opponent is unbalanced. Not being violent is passive; nonviolence is confrontational and uncomfortable. \u201cI don\u2019t like being disliked,\u201d says Baines. \u201cI\u2019ve had to get used to being hated.\u201d\\nActivists such as Andreas Malm, author of How to Blow Up a Pipeline: Learning to Fight in a World on Fire, argue that violent protest, chiefly sabotage, is legitimate. Movements for women\u2019s suffrage, the abolition of slavery and the end of apartheid all had violent flanks. Just Stop Oil, however, argues that nonviolence is both an ethical choice and a strategic one. In Why Civil Resistance Works, American academics Erica Chenoweth and Maria J Stephan demonstrate that nonviolence has a far greater chance of realising its aims than violence. Just Stop Oil weeds out any volunteer who might not to be able to sustain nonviolence under pressure. One man at the training day demonstrates how he would take down somebody who attacked him. \u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t take part in the action,\u201d Baines gently suggests.\\nBefore she became an activist, Baines tells me, she was \u201cvery upset and depressed. I was trying to tell people about it and they weren\u2019t listening. Then I saw Extinction Rebellion on the news and read about their theory of change.\u201d She has since been arrested six times. \u201cIt\u2019s odd what you can get used to doing. It\u2019s not how I saw my life going but I feel like I\u2019ve been left with no choice, and that\u2019s how most people in Just Stop Oil feel.\u201d\\nDe-escalators are usually women because they receive less abuse. An hour into the training day, four people arrive furiously late, having waited in the wrong room, and the mood is suddenly tense. The skill with which Baines defuses their irritation and welcomes them into the group is a fine example of everyday de-escalation.\\n\u201cNonviolence training is an education in itself,\u201d Wildin tells me. \u201cWhen we encounter conflict within campaigns, we all try to apply our nonviolent approach to living.\u201d Wildin threw herself into activism two years ago, after her children left home, and has since been arrested 22 times for a range of direct actions, including Stop HS2. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve discovered is that the laws are designed to protect property, profit and power,\u201d she says.\\nChristian Murray-Leslie came to activism even later than Wildin. A gently spoken 77-year-old retired NHS consultant, he describes himself as \u201cslightly left of centre \u2013 not a headbanger\u201d. He keeps bees and spends his evenings rescuing toads from the roads near his home in Devon. Since his first arrest at an XR protest in Parliament Square in September 2020, he has been arrested six times with Insulate Britain. Members of the public, Murray-Leslie says, are more frightening than the police because there is no set procedure. They tend to start by blowing horns and shouting abuse. Some then become violent, hitting or dragging protesters. The advice is to be apologetic but resolute, explaining why they are there. \u201cWhat you do in the first two to three seconds is critical,\u201d he says. \u201cYou need to show respect and answer their points without any trace of aggression.\u201d\\nA few months after an arrest, a charging letter arrives. Protesters are free to plead guilty and accept a fine but the organisers\u2019 advice is to file a plea of not guilty, thus insisting on the legitimacy of the protest and tying up the court system. Most climate activists have been acquitted or seen their cases dismissed but at least 18 were jailed for contempt of court last year. A few days ago, 117 of the 174 Insulate Britain activists arrested last autumn were officially charged, mostly with causing a public nuisance. Unsurprisingly, most activists are under 30 or over 60. \u201cThere tends to be people who don\u2019t have anything to lose and then people who have the freedom and financial stability to take those risks,\u201d Baines says. \u201cThere are a lot of people who want to do it but they need to keep a roof over their heads.\u201d\\nCivil disobedience usually gets a bad press. Even people sympathetic to the cause, such as David Attenborough and Sadiq Khan, have criticised XR and Insulate Britain for alienating the general public with disruptive tactics. Activists counter that XR helped to inspire parliament to declare a climate emergency in May 2019, and Insulate Britain is the reason why Andrea Leadsom, former secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, recently described home insulation as \u201clow-hanging fruit in the energy space\u201d. Nonetheless, there is a sense that Just Stop Oil, by targeting the oil industry rather than the general public, will be less contentious.\\n\u201cI wish there was more focus on why we\u2019re doing it and less on the tactics,\u201d Baines says. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we shouldn\u2019t be criticised \u2013 part of nonviolence training is being accountable for your actions \u2013 but we\u2019re not disrupting people for the sake of it. We\u2019re potentially looking at the collapse of civilisation and the government isn\u2019t doing anything about it. If anything, I\u2019d say we\u2019re being quite restrained.\u201d\\nAfter lunch, it\u2019s role play time. Two tables are placed end to end to represent an oil tanker and protesters are assigned roles: six sitting in the road, one on top of the tanker, and two locked on to the side. \u201cI can\u2019t smoke during this, which would be horrible for me,\u201d jokes a middle-aged vicar. The next scenario is a road blockade, with half the group playing the part of angry drivers. \u201cThese fucking climate protesters!\u201d shouts Baines with alarming conviction. \u201cWho do they think they are? Wankers! Get a job!\u201d They practise shielding one another from blows, \u201cgoing floppy\u201d so that they are harder to lift, and protecting themselves by lying on their right sides and covering their heads, although the weapons today are only bundles of rolled-up socks. \u201cWe never retaliate,\u201d says Wildin. \u201cWe just take it.\u201d\\nAt the end of the day, everyone is asked to say whether or not they\u2019re prepared to face abuse and arrest by participating in an action. Some realise they are not ready and offer to serve in support roles. \u201cIt\u2019s now or never but I can\u2019t quite do it,\u201d one woman says guiltily. \u201cI think it\u2019s about changing people\u2019s hearts,\u201d says another. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m a bit envious of your bravery but does it do any good?\u201d A grey-haired woman called Viv, however, decides that she is all in. \u201cThe role play\u2019s good because it deflects from being scared shitless,\u201d she says cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019m ready to go.\u201d\\nWitnessing the action at Navigator inspires deja vu. I recognise almost every component from either the training day or the action meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s an unbeatable, repeatable formula,\u201d one activist tells me. Between the first blockade and another around the bend, a total of seven tankers are crowned with activists in orange hi-vis vests bearing Just Stop Oil\u2019s calligram of a skull. The police mill around, waiting for backup. \u201cWhat if they start smoking?\u201d asks one officer.\\nThere\u2019s just one deviation from the plan: one tanker driver threatens the banner-holding activists so ferociously that everyone ends up scaling a tanker for safety. In Leicester, I thought that the people role-playing angry drivers were laying it on a bit thick but if anything, they were far too mild. The abuse is astonishing: \u201cIf the police weren\u2019t here, I\u2019d come up and fucking throw you off myself!\u201d \u201cI hope one of them falls off and breaks their fucking neck.\u201d And to an activist with a ladder: \u201cYou put that up there, mate, and I\u2019m going to ram it down your fucking throat!\u201d\\nDriving a tanker with people on top may be illegal but one driver in the second blockade does it anyway, reversing slightly to create a gap in the road. Another drags down the road a young Irish woman, who curls up and shields her head. Pavel Ivanov claims that a third grabbed him by the throat. Half a dozen terminal workers form a chorus of hecklers: \u201cYou look like you\u2019re just out of nappies!\u201d \u201cGo and get a fucking job!\u201d Following nonviolence training to the letter, the activists apologise for the disruption and explain why they believe it is necessary. The response: \u201cShut up, you cunt.\u201d\\nAfter an hour, the drivers\u2019 rage fizzles out. It\u2019s obvious that nobody is going anywhere, and it is brutally cold. The only noises are the choppy drone of a police helicopter and the occasional crackle of a walkie-talkie. A few of the occupiers are curled up in sleeping bags. Snow is falling in light flurries. A strange peace descends on a frozen tableau. There are similar scenes at nine more simultaneous actions staged by Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion at sites around England. By early afternoon, ExxonMobil UK has been forced to suspend operations at four terminals.\\nThree days later, the protests are still going on. At least 275 activists have been arrested, mostly at three sites in Essex, and there are petrol and diesel shortages across the south-east. When I catch up with Hunt and Ivanov over the phone, they tell me that a special police team erected scaffolding and began removing occupiers from the tankers on stretchers on Friday afternoon but that the last ones weren\u2019t taken away until 3pm on Saturday. Meanwhile another team dug a tunnel under Navigator and two of them are still there. Around 35 activists were arrested for tampering with a vehicle and held in cells before being released on bail and banned from returning to Essex. \u201cAt the debrief everybody was in tears,\u201d Ivanov says. \u201cIn a positive way. We\u2019d held the site for 36 hours with an entirely youth-based team. Everybody\u2019s really proud.\u201d\\nA few of them went home to rest and reflect. Most returned to the safe house and began planning their next action.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36a4479a7d1571fb47aae2f6bc91f9bcaf387d09/296_186_6424_3854/master/6424.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "A lone Just Stop Oil protester stands in front of an oil tanker truck in Purfleet."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/722410bfca1180bc403ab1b69c0e25c50ce286b8/16_39_1536_983/master/1536.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Louis McKechnie and Hannah Hunt at Downing Street with with Just Stop Oil\u2019s letter for the government"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/672a681289d86b44b4ecdede52bb81dbde1f466b/0_282_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Just Stop Oil blockade an oil storage depot in Purfleet."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7d8249bcc18107471157e683750a650319c2fc9/258_222_2742_1775/master/2742.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Roger Hallam, during Extinction Rebellion protests in London in 2019"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c6fdf3c470b73d48704bd20cd126bf07f9e256b/0_253_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Just Stop Oil activists at the Baftas."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6656978c412b067ee90211e6be06b3006cc4c4f2/0_400_6004_3603/master/6004.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Just Stop Oil protesters at Piccadilly Circus, London, during the youth climate strike in December."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84c3f8d66702be9f869b526f7d9ccedfa71945c7/0_267_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Just Stop Oil protesters on top of a oil tanker truck."]], "author": ["Dorian Lynskey"], "date": "2022-04-10"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/01/down-to-earth-just-stop-oil-protest": {"title": "Inside Just Stop Oil, the youth climate group blocking UK refineries", "subtitle": null, "text": "A band of 20-year-olds have made headlines disrupting football games, the Baftas and now oil facilities across the UK. But what do they want?\\nLouis McKechnie is the face that launched a thousand British football memes. In March, the 21-year-old caused a stop to play when he ran onto the pitch at Goodison Park during a match between Everton and Newcastle and zip-tied himself to a goalpost by his neck.\n  If anything could have enraged the 40,000 jeering football fans more, it was the solemnity with which he did it. But while for many the episode will have merely been jotted down as another entry in the annals of absurdity, his cause was deadly serious.\\nA day earlier, Maddie, 21, and Kai, 20 \u2013 who did not give their surnames \u2013 attempted to stage a similar action at Arsenal\u2019s Emirates Stadium in north London. Kai took a long pause and looked around him at the slowly filling stands before describing how he felt about what they had planned.\n \u201cEvery single second I spend here, I want to do what I\u2019m going to do less, because I can see everyone just trying to have a nice time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I know it\u2019s what is right; I know that it has to happen.\u201d\\nFuel to the fire\n  Louis, Maddie and Kai are all young activists with a climate group called Just Stop Oil. They have called on the UK government to halt all new fossil fuel projects in order to avoid the worst effects of climate change. If their efforts fail, they intend to paralyse the supply chain themselves, using non-violent direct action to disrupt the strategic oil and gas infrastructure that keeps the UK moving.\n  The ambition is big. \u201cWe are mobilising upwards of 1,000 people,\u201d one JSO activist told the Guardian. \u201cThis is going to be a fusion of other large-scale blockade-style actions you have seen in the past.\u201d\n  Just Stop Oil say they are taking inspiration from UK lorry drivers\u2019 protests in 2000, when, furious at a rise in fuel duty, hauliers and farmers staged blockades that paralysed petrol distribution. Hundreds of petrol stations ran dry, leading to empty shelves in supermarkets, delays to mail deliveries and schools being closed. Protests ended after the government said it would order soldiers to secure deliveries, but they won: then-chancellor Gordon Brown announced in that year\u2019s budget that fuel duty would be frozen.\n  But where 20 years ago those protesters enjoyed public support in their campaign against rising prices, Just Stop Oil\u2019s target is the fossil fuel system itself. While polling shows large majorities regard the climate as one of the most important issues of the moment, it\u2019s unclear whether that understanding would continue if the pumps were empty.\n  At a recruitment meeting last Thursday in Camden, north London, Larch Maxey, a veteran eco-campaigner, said the aim was \u201cto build a community of civil resistance in response to the climate change science\u201d.\n  \u201cIn 2022 you have got tens of thousands of peer-reviewed papers spelling out the climate science,\u201d he said. Authorities such as David Attenborough and David King, the former government chief science officer, were in agreement, he said: there is a narrow window of two to three years in which to act. \u201cWe are facing the end of civilisation if we do not act on the climate emergency. We are heading towards societal collapse.\n  \u201cWhen your house is on fire, you stop pouring petrol on the flames,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s basically the demand \u2013 no new licences. We are in a crisis. Let\u2019s stop digging out new oil and gas.\u201d\\nNew kids on the blockade\n  Just Stop Oil doesn\u2019t just share rhetoric with Extinction Rebellion, it sits within an arc of escalation that began with that group\u2019s blockades of five Thames bridges in 2018. Since then, the environmental movement has continued to explore new non-violent tactical provocations to draw attention to its demands.\n  Many of those involved are, like Maxey, veterans of XR and the HS2 protests; McKechnie is one of a number who took action with Insulate Britain. As with those groups, the silhouette of Roger Hallam also looms behind Just Stop Oil. Although the Guardian has been told it is wrong to describe Hallam as the mastermind of this latest campaign, he featured prominently in early coverage of its activities.\n  The key shift in Just Stop Oil is what its supporters say is a move from civil disobedience and into civil resistance. What that means, as Jess Causby, 25, a supporter of the campaign, told the Guardian last month, \u201cis stopping pointing out what the government should or shouldn\u2019t be doing [and instead] actively stopping government doing what they shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d\n  The question is whether they can pull it off. The record of actions attended by Guardian reporters has not immediately seemed propitious. Young activists who tried to storm the red carpet at the Baftas two weeks ago misjudged how difficult it would be to reach, and ended up blocking its road-entrance instead. Kai and Maddie were intercepted before they could prove a nuisance at Arsenal. A small group who tried to disrupt play at Tottenham were also swiftly handled.\n  Their next plan is to tackle a much bigger target, and they can expect to be anticipated. Oil companies have already begun to make preparations. What will happen next remains to be seen.\\nThis piece first appeared in Down to Earth, the Guardian\u2019s climate crisis newsletter, on Thursday 31 March before Friday\u2019s protests at oil terminals across the UK.

voted against the company\u2019s financial statements over a lack of clarity about climate change risks at the mining giant\u2019s London annual general meeting.\\nAhead of the vote, investment management firm Sarasin & Partners declared its intention to vote against the company\u2019s financial statements, against keeping accounting firm KPMG on as auditor and questioned the performance of the company\u2019s audit committee.\\nA note from the firm\u2019s head of stewardship, Natasha Landell-Mills, said Rio Tinto had not disclosed key material about how it would transition to a zero carbon economy.\\n\u201cWhile Rio has increased its discussion of climate risks and made clear that its accounts are not 1.5C aligned, thereby providing welcome transparency, it does not provide disclosures on its quantitative assumptions, or visibility as to how it would be impacted if its own stated goal to be 1.5C-aligned were achieved,\u201d Landell-Mills said.\\nThe note did not say the firm was voting against the company\u2019s climate statement.\\nAuditors are essential to making investment decisions and any failure to identify, discuss and disclose whether a company is able to meet its climate commitments, and the risk of stranded assets, means investors will be left on the hook.\\nRio Tinto\u2019s largest source of carbon emissions are scope 3 emissions \u2013 the emissions created by assets not owned or controlled by the reporting organisations.\\nAs the smelters responsible for turning its iron ore into steel operate in China, Japan and South Korea, and are not owned by the company, the mining giant has so far resisted placing a target on scope 3 emissions.\\nBut investors have been increasingly putting pressure on the company to act.\\nAn assessment by the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) of Rio Tinto\u2019s climate statement found that despite progress elsewhere, the company was not doing enough these emissions.\\nIt also found Rio Tinto maintained memberships in industry associations that lobbied against climate action.\\nDan Gocher, ACCR director of climate and environment, said that as the company does not individually disclose the voting numbers from its London and Australian AGMs, it was difficult to tell the exact level of opposition.\\n\u201cThere\u2019s likely to have been some investor opposition to Rio Tinto\u2019s climate report overnight primarily because Rio has not set targets for scope 3 emissions, which it has resisted for many years,\u201d Gocher said.\\n\u201cIt did, however, make very significant commitments at the end of 2021 to reduce its operational emissions and allocated significant capital expenditure to achieve that.\u201d\\nGlenn Walker, a senior campaigner with Greenpeace Australia, said it was \u201cabsolutely wild\u201d that how investors voted was not publicly disclosed.\\n\u201cTransparency is critical,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThere should be an open record on who votes on what at AGM and shareholder meetings so we can hold investors to account for their climate commitments.\u201d\\nWalker said this year would mark a test for investors and auditing firms about how genuine they are in their commitment to assessing climate risk and acting to mitigate it.\\nFollowing investor discontent in the UK, he said Rio Tinto was on notice ahead of its general meeting in a month \u2013 along with the rest of corporate Australia.\\nHe said that a vote scheduled in two months by AGL seeking permission from its shareholders to split its coal assets into a separate company was a critical moment for firms that have signed up to the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative.\\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of nice statements, but this is where the rubber hits the road,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real big test for these investors and their auditors over their climate commitments.\\n\u201cOur view is they shouldn\u2019t let the demerger proceed because they want to keep burning coal to 2045.\u201d\\nRio Tinto was contacted for comment.\\nThis story and headline was modified on 22 April 2022 to refer to management firm Sarasin &

Her parents, Pat (Patricia, nee Knight), a homemaker, and George Dale, who worked for the charity Community Transport in Salford, had 12 children through birth and adoption. In addition, they fostered dozens more, both short-term and long-term, and all were treated as their own. In this way, Anne had more than 60 brothers and sisters.

They married in 1987.\\nAnne studied medicine at Leeds Medical School, qualifying in 1987, and trained in paediatrics at hospitals in and around Newcastle. After they both qualified as doctors, she and Terry went to the Gambia, where from 1991 to 1993 she was the first woman to head the Medical Research Council\u2019s Dunn human nutrition unit. As well as running the field station with more than 100 staff, she completed a research project on helicobacter pylori infection in Gambian children, part of her doctoral thesis for Newcastle University, which she completed in 2001.\\nFrom 1994 onwards, she worked at the Royal Victoria infirmary in Newcastle, and Newcastle General hospital and Queen Elizabeth hospital in Gateshead, becoming a consultant paediatrician at the last of these in 2001.

And, as with many social movements, the long interregnum of the Covid pandemic and its curbs on social interaction hampered XR\u2019s ability to organise.\\nXR organisers are hoping a new strategy will enable them to evade police and again cause major disruption in London. Attempts to take and hold road junctions with large pieces of protest infrastructure, which police had learned to quickly isolate and remove, will be swapped for more mobile and adaptable blockades.\\n\u201cWe are not going to be coming in with huge objects necessarily, but the plan is to get lots of people to hold areas using their bodies, staying in roads and holding spaces,\u201d said an XR source. \u201cWe are going to try to be really mobile as well.\u201d\\nThere would be \u201cpeople moving around and trying to hold the space, holding spaces that are particularly disruptive and doing direct actions \u2026 We want to be movable so we can go to different areas if we want to.

We will not stand by and let this happen. Scientists have been sounding the alarm for decades but have been ignored by governments.\u201d\\nRichard Ecclestone, a former inspector with Devon and Cornwall police who was acting as legal observer of the protest for XR, said the scientists had decided on the action because of the energy strategy. \u201cThey put this action together to draw the attention of the department for business, to remind them of what the science is,\u201d he said.\\n\u201cThey\u2019ve taken quotes from recent scientific reports saying basically there\u2019s irrefutable evidence now that we cannot continue to search for and exploit oil and gas reserves, or that will mean death.\u201d\\nDr Charlie Gardner, 43, a conservation scientist and associate senior lecturer at the University of Kent, said: \u201cAt both the domestic and international policy level, there are very powerful actors who don\u2019t want our society to decarbonise.\\n\u201cThere are people who are very wealthy and powerful from the way that the world is set up now and they don\u2019t want that to change, they don\u2019t want to decarbonise because that will limit their opportunity to generate money from fossil fuels.\\n\u201cAs a result we have government departments making decisions that will lead us to calamity, and as a scientist I know what impacts this has, I can see that coming, and I can\u2019t be passive, I can\u2019t just let that happen. I need to act.\u201d\\nAt least 10 scientists were arrested after spray-painting extinction symbols in the glass facade of the BEIS building. Among them was Prof Colin Davis, the chair in cognitive psychology at Bristol university. Gardner said they had escalated the protest with spray-painting in an effort to provoke the police into making arrests.\\n\u201cColin is a professor of psychology, and I can\u2019t speak for him but his work is about how to influence people and I believe it is his understanding of how to influence the public, how to bring about social change, his professional understanding [that] has led him to believe this is the most powerful action he can take,\u201d Gardner said. The Guardian has contacted the Metropolitan police for more details of arrests linked to the protest.\\nA BEIS spokesperson said: \u201cWe are gradually driving down demand for oil and gas, but we cannot have a cliff edge by turning off our domestic source overnight. Doing so would put our energy security, British jobs and industries at risk and simply increase foreign imports, not reduce demand. Our British energy security strategy sets out a long-term plan to ramp up cheap renewables as we transition away from expensive fossil fuels.\u201d\\nSouth of the river, other supporters of XR had ended a mass march by surrounding the buildings that house the UK headquarters of the oil and gas company Shell. Several had managed to get inside and glue themselves and several XR flyers to the reception desk. Others were glued to the floor in the private office complex surrounding the site.\\nXR said it was demanding a meeting with Ben van Beurden, Shell\u2019s chief executive. Outside, about 100 people from XR\u2019s whistleblowing platform, TruthTeller, each held up a placard with the name of an individual Shell employee and the words \u201cPlease join us\u201d.\\nChloe Naldrett, 42, a theatre producer from Bristol, was glued by her hand to the floor just outside the revolving doors to the Shell reception, where she was telling the site\u2019s security manager why she was refusing to leave. The science, she told him, \u201csaid no more fossil fuels. No more fossil fuels!\u201d\\nNaldrett told the Guardian: \u201cWe\u2019re here outside Shell because Shell have absolutely no intention of stopping investing in fossil fuels \u2026 They currently have plans to expand their fossil fuel business by 20% for the next few decades. And that, for me, is a death sentence for my children.\\n\u201cI\u2019m here as a mother doing the only thing that I feel I can do \u2026 I\u2019m now taking direct action, out of a place of desperation really, because what else can I do for them?\u201d\\nOne XR protester had managed to infiltrate the eighth floor of the Shell building. In a video shot inside the building and circulated to journalists by XR, Andy Smith said: \u201cI\u2019m taking this action to basically highlight Shell\u2019s aggressive approach to extracting oil in foreign countries.

Bottom trawling happens in many of these environmentally significant areas, leading campaigners and experts to refer to them as nothing but \u201cpaper parks\u201d. Not only does it disturb species living on the seabed, it is also a significant source of carbon release, as the seabed normally acts as a valuable sink to absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, but turns into a carbon source when disturbed.\\nNow, the method will be banned, with government sources referring to the new legislation as a result of \u201cBrexit freedoms\u201d. The four bylaws, being introduced using new powers under the 2020 Fisheries Act, will come into effect in June.\\nThe environment secretary, George Eustice, said: \u201cOutside the EU, we are using our new freedoms to protect our marine environment. We will be stopping trawling and dredging in these marine protected areas to protect wildlife and habitats, through powers we have in our Fisheries Act 2020.\u201d\\nAs well as Dogger Bank, there are three other MPAs being saved from bottom trawling. These are Inner Dowsing, Race Bank and North Ridge special area of conservation, , which lies off the south Lincolnshire coast, the South Dorset marine conservation zone and the Canyons marine conservation zone, which is in the far south-west corner of the UK\u2019s continental shelf area.\\nHowever, experts have pointed out there are 64 MPAs, most of which have few protections from destructive fishing.\\nMelissa Moore, the head of UK policy at the NGO Oceana, said: \u201cIt\u2019s good news that government has at last taken the first step to manage four of its 64 offshore benthic MPAs, given that damaging activity such as bottom trawling is prohibited in MPAs under conservation law.\\n\u201cWe fully support the Dogger Bank bylaw that will protect the whole site and have benefits for the North Sea ecosystem beyond. However, the bylaw proposed for Inner Dowsing MPA is tiny and will only protect parts of the site. We call on UK to remedy this and with devolved governments to act quickly to ban bottom-towed gear in the remaining 60 offshore MPAs that they promised to manage following Oceana\u2019s legal challenge in 2021. This is now increasingly urgent due to the climate and ecological crises.\u201d\\nGreenpeace has been campaigning for the government to stop trawling at Dogger Bank, most notably dropping rocks in the MPA to thwart trawlers. Campaigners have asked the government to use its post-Brexit powers to go further and ban destructive fishing practices in all MPAs.\\nFiona Nicholls, an oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been 18 months since Greenpeace built a protective boulder barrier in the Dogger Bank and since the government committed to stop bottom trawling in this iconic and ecologically important area. While this is a major step towards protecting some of the most environmentally significant features of the Dogger Bank, destructive industrial fishing vessels like factory trawlers will still be allowed to plunder this now partially protected area.\\n\u201cWe need the government to get us on track this year to fully or highly protecting all of our marine protected areas. That means, as a starting point, banning all destructive industrial fishing vessels. This could be done using post-Brexit powers to restrict fishing licences, rather than simply relying on the cumbersome process of introducing partial site bylaw restrictions.

It\u2019s almost possible to imagine Starmer as a politician back in those more stable times.\\nThis old-fashioned, rather severe persona has sometimes been pretty effective. We are in one of those periods now, with Starmer easily dismissing Johnson\u2019s shoddy homework in the Commons, and Labour ahead in the polls and expected to do well at next week\u2019s local elections. With the Tories seemingly running out of talent and policy options, a Starmer government is starting to become imaginable.\\nYet at other times during his leadership, his \u201cgrownup\u201d act has fallen flat \u2013 and it could easily happen again. Next to Johnson\u2019s antics and the drama of the pandemic and Ukraine, any opposition leader would sometimes struggle to get attention. And Starmer, with his methodical, rather than intuitive, approach to strategy, his slightly yelping voice and stiff body language, is not a political natural. He is a workmanlike leader, partly because that\u2019s his character, as the modest but growing number of Starmer biographies make clear.\\nMore importantly, his leadership style also reveals a lot about his party and our wider politics. Ever since Labour\u2019s crushing defeats and loss of confidence in the 1980s, to be a grownup Labour leader, in the eyes of most journalists, Labour MPs and strategists, has meant moving to the right. Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband led in very different circumstances, from the highly favourable to the near-impossible. But all reacted by shedding leftwing policies and acquiring more rightwing ones, by courting conservative interests and cutting adrift Labour\u2019s radicals.\\nElectorally, this approach only worked for Blair: a rare talent whose tenure also coincided with a particularly weak and divided Tory party. Otherwise, many voters, after initially being intrigued, have tended to conclude that Labour leaders who offer ideologically \u201cmoderate\u201d maturity are a bit boring, inauthentic, or not to be trusted. The same newspapers that help persuade Labour leaders to shift rightwards often then tell their readers that the party has not shifted enough. Kinnock, for example, got a good press for bashing the left in his early years as leader; but when he looked as if he might actually win an election, in 1992, the tabloids destroyed him.\\nYet Labour\u2019s urge to seem grown up persists. Partly it\u2019s sustained by the conviction that a less respectable, more leftwing party would do even worse at elections \u2013 which is why it\u2019s so important both to New Labour veterans and Starmerites that the huge vote for Corbyn in 2017 is forgotten.\\nBehind this conviction is another layer of pessimism: a belief that Britain, by which the Labour grownups usually mean England, is fundamentally a conservative country. In this environment, the argument goes, Labour can only exist as a significant force if it looks safe and sensible. The importance of retired voters in general elections, and the collapse since 2010 in the proportion of them choosing Labour, from about a third to about a sixth, add to the pressure on Starmer to be conventional. In today\u2019s Britain, growing up, political maturity and the renunciation of leftwing politics seem to go together more than ever.\\nAs leader, Starmer has reinforced this connection. In his youth, he was part of a radical collective that produced Socialist Alternatives, a short-lived 1980s magazine which argued presciently that the left should pay more attention to the environment and feminism. Yet on Desert Island Discs in 2020, he mocked his days at the magazine: \u201cWe were out to change the world \u2026 I said some things that were daft.\u201d He had become less dogmatic, he continued, \u201cas I\u2019ve grown up\u201d.\\nBut the idea that radicalism is always immature and naive is itself a form of dogma. During the 1990s and 2000s, when much of the west was relatively stable and prosperous under centrist governments, this cautious view of politics was fairly easy to justify. Yet today, with the climate emergency and capitalism lurching from crisis to crisis, it is the anti-radical position that often seems unrealistic. When the climate activist group Just Stop Oil began blockading fuel depots this month, Labour called for \u201cimmediate nationwide injunctions\u201d to halt the protests, because they \u201ccause misery for motorists\u201d. This stance may please some voters at the local elections, but it\u2019s unlikely to seem wise in years to come. The same goes for Starmer\u2019s neglect of the young left that Corbyn mobilised, which could have been Labour\u2019s future.\\nIn our era of flux, is there a chance that Starmer\u2019s leadership could change? In Oliver Eagleton\u2019s persuasive new biography, The Starmer Project: A Journey to the Right, his trajectory seems set: an idealistic lawyer protecting civil liberties gradually metamorphoses into a paternalistic party leader promising voters \u201csecurity\u201d.\\nIn theory, the latter offer still has radical potential, as one of the main causes of insecurity in Britain is our version of free-market capitalism. As leader, Starmer has repeatedly said that he wants an economy which is no longer \u201crooted in insecurity and inequality\u201d. Were he to become prime minister, however, the pressure to drop this goal would be considerable: many businesses have done very well out of Britain\u2019s harsh economic model. Taking advantage of the Tories\u2019 difficulties with some employers over Brexit, Starmer has already been trying to woo the private sector by calling Labour \u201cthe party of business\u201d.\\nTo his admirers and lieutenants, such manoeuvres are simply grownup politics. If you want an end to Tory rule, they argue, this stern man in a suit is the person to deliver it. They may be right. But being a fully functional prime minister, like being a fully functional adult, isn\u2019t just about professionalism and authority. It\u2019s also about the ability to charm, communicate effectively, show empathy. We\u2019ve yet to see those sides of him \u2013 if we ever will. Without them, a Starmer government, however welcome at first, will be hard work for him and for us.\\nAndy Beckett is a Guardian columnist", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca29b7c80380647fa5398ba2c1f892ff91bee22d/0_0_5796_3478/master/5796.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Keir Starmer in Workington, Cumbria, 28 April 2022."]], "author": ["Andy Beckett"], "date": "2022-04-29"}}
