Boris Johnson\u2019s government, cheered on by sections of the British press, is waging a \u201cwar on woke\u201d to deal with this alleged crisis, targeting leftwing activists, anti-racists, academics and trans rights advocates.\\nSome have suggested ministers are stoking this culture war to distract voters from their failures in government. But this explanation underestimates the ideological reasons behind the government\u2019s strategy, which is better understood as an attempt to shift the Overton window to the right while framing the rights of minorities as a fringe concern. The Conservatives seek a post-Brexit Britain bolstered by (among other things) an increasingly nativist and divisive populism, and a national pride in the achievements of the British empire, untrammelled by leftwing critics.\\nThere is a long history in Britain of the right whipping up a moral panic about leftwing activists working within state institutions to promote minority issues that most \u201cordinary\u201d people supposedly oppose. In the 1980s, the British media portrayed a coalition of Marxists, anti-racists, feminists and gay rights activists as the \u201cloony left\u201d, a trope that was embraced by editors, journalists and politicians alike, particularly during the 1987 general election.\\nUnder Margaret Thatcher, the Conservatives endorsed a neoliberal free-market economy, but their liberalism did not extend beyond this. The government\u2019s regressive approach to issues of race, gender and sexuality was famously characterised as one of \u201cVictorian values\u201d. For the British right in the 1980s, a war on the \u201cloony left\u201d was part of a broader ideological battle to reverse the social changes of the 1960s, when progress had been made on issues such as legalising homosexuality and abortion, and the increased awareness the \u201c1968 generation\u201d showed towards the rights of women, gay people and Black and Asian people.\\nAfter Thatcher\u2019s electoral victory in 1979, the influence that the British left had previously enjoyed withered. Meanwhile, the face of leftwing politics was changing. In the 1970s and 80s, an array of social movements emerged, including the Anti-Nazi League in response to the National Front, the women\u2019s liberation movement and the growing gay rights movement. These pluralist movements indicated that the left needed to take issues such as race, gender and sexuality seriously.\\nWhile many leftwing MPs resigned themselves to fighting defensive battles at the national level, local government became a fertile site of resistance to Thatcherism. Councils across London, alongside the Greater London council (GLC) under Ken Livingstone, Sheffield city council and Liverpool city council became places to enact socialist politics in a country governed by majority Tory rule. The GLC funded anti-racist, feminist and pro-LGBT initiatives, while many local councils made strident efforts to denounce apartheid in South Africa and announced nuclear-free zones. In London, Ken Livingstone infamously organised talks with Sinn F\u00e9in representatives through the GLC.\\nUnsurprisingly, this provoked anger among sections of the British press. As James Curran, Ivor Gaber and Julian Petley show in their book, Culture Wars: The Media and the British Left, the tabloids started using the term \u201cloony left\u201d in the mid-1980s to portray \u201cthe rise of a \u2018crackpot\u2019 left more concerned with minorities than with class\u201d. Apocryphal stories of what would come to be known in the 1990s as \u201cpolitical correctness gone mad\u201d, such as the alleged banning of the word \u201cmanhole\u201d or the censoring of the nursery rhyme Baa Baa Black Sheep by Hackney council, made tabloid headlines \u2013 supposedly exposing the left\u2019s fixation with \u201cfringe\u201d and minority issues.\\nStories of the \u201cloony left\u201d helped to justify the ultimate abolition of the GLC. The Conservatives made this a promise in their 1983 election manifesto, and alongside the defeat of the miners\u2019 strike in 1985, the dissolution of the GLC in 1986 can be viewed as a Thatcherite victory over socialist politics. But stories of local authorities engaging with these issues still abounded, leading to further action by the Thatcher government. One of the most significant moves came in 1988, when the Conservatives introduced section 28 of the Local Government Act, which sought to \u201cprohibit the promotion of homosexuality by local authorities\u201d. It wasn\u2019t until 2003 that the Blair government repealed it.\\nOf course, criticisms of the \u201cloony left\u201d \u2013 and the implicit accusation that too much attention was being devoted to the rights of minorities \u2013 weren\u2019t exclusively the preserve of Conservatives. Many people in the Labour party also attacked sections of the left that supported these issues. In 1983, the gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell ran as the Labour candidate in the Bermondsey byelection. He was criticised by Labour party insiders, and said that the party leadership pressured him to keep quiet about his private life. Under Neil Kinnock, Labour still viewed gay rights as a minority issue that might not appeal to voters, while Kinnock and Roy Hattersley, Labour\u2019s former deputy leader, opposed the party\u2019s Black Sections, the movement established in 1983 to demand greater representation for African Caribbean and Asian people.\\nThere are clear parallels between criticisms of the \u201cloony left\u201d in the 1980s and the labelling of movements such as Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion as \u201cwoke\u201d in the present day. In both eras, Conservative politicians and sections of the British press have demonised leftwing movements and portrayed them as worrisome forces attempting to infiltrate national institutions. While the right sought to rid local authorities of the \u201cloony left\u201d in the 1980s, they\u2019re now raising the alarm over the alleged creep of \u201cwokeness\u201d in cultural institutions such as the BBC and the National Trust.\\nAs the political theorist Lea Ypi wrote last year, this culture war is stoking fears that Britain is threatened by leftwing \u201cidentity politics\u201d that are harmful to a particular British way of life. Just as stories about the \u201cloony left\u201d gave credence to Thatcher\u2019s war on local government in the second half of the 1980s, similar fear of \u201cwokeness\u201d and charges of \u201cleftwing bias\u201d or \u201cvirtue signalling\u201d have legitimised the pressure that ministers have placed upon institutions such as the BBC. While some of their targets may have changed, the scare tactics of the right have not.\\nEvan Smith is is the author of No Platform: A History of Anti-Fascism, Universities and the Limits of Free Speech", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0501173c9bc7079a202d9aec024c902595f5e633/0_174_3966_2379/master/3966.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Ian McKellen and Peter Tatchell lead a march against section 28, Manchester, February 1988."]], "author": ["Evan Smith"], "date": "2021-04-21"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/09/greta-thunberg-says-she-will-not-attend-cop26-climate-summit": {"title": "Greta Thunberg says she will not attend Cop26 climate summit", "subtitle": null, "text": "Swedish activist says uneven Covid vaccine rollout means countries would not participate on even terms\\nThe Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg has said she will not attend the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November, saying the uneven distribution of Covid-19 vaccines would mean countries could not participate on even terms.\\nThe 18-year-old activist said that by November richer countries would be vaccinating young healthy people \u201cvery often at the expense of people in at-risk groups in other parts of the world\u201d.\\n\u201cWith the extremely inequitable vaccine distribution I will not attend the Cop26 conference if the development continues as it is now,\u201d Thunberg said.\\nPressure on the UK as Cop26 approaches\\nCampaigners and climate experts have been increasingly concerned about a series of government actions that appear to be out of step with the government\u2019s commitment to net zero emissions, ahead of hosting vital UN climate talks, called\u00a0Cop26, this November in Glasgow. As host and president of the talks, the UK will have to bring squabbling nations together to\u00a0agree to slash emissions drastically in the next ten years, and reach net zero emissions by mid-century.\\nRebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said the government must reject airport expansion to show leadership at Cop26: \u201cIf true, pausing the plans is a sign that the government is starting to clock the catastrophic impacts of this proposed expansion. But we\u2019re just months away from hosting critical global climate talks, and this climate-wrecking mega project is clearly incompatible with our plans to cut emissions, so why only delay the decision and not just call it in now? Quashing the expansion plans before the global climate summit begins would be a real show of climate leadership.\u201d\\nGreen groups\u00a0received assurances from civil servants in 2019\u00a0that decisions on new infrastructure that could increase greenhouse gas emissions would take account of the government\u2019s target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. However, the\u00a0supreme court ruled last December\u00a0that the government\u2019s commitments under the\u00a02015 Paris agreement\u00a0could effectively be ignored in the decision to press ahead with a third runway at Heathrow.\\nA group of more than 130 prominent scientists, academics and lawyers, including former Nasa scientist James Hansen, and UK former chief scientist Sir David King, last week\u00a0wrote to the government expressing concern over the supreme court ruling, and warning that the government\u2019s international climate commitments were being ignored. They wrote: \u201cThe highest court in the UK has set a precedent that major national projects can proceed even where they are inconsistent with maintaining the temperature limit on which our collective survival depends. Indeed, the precedent goes further still. It says that the government is not bound even to consider the goals of an agreement that is near universally agreed. Not only does that undermine the UK\u2019s status as a champion of the Paris agreement just ahead of Cop26. It also substantially reduces humanity\u2019s prospects of maintaining that limit and hence averting disaster.\u201d\\nOther recent controversial decisions, such as the government\u2019s initial backing for the\u00a0Cumbrian coal mine, and a\u00a0new round of licences granted to extract oil and gas from the North Sea, have also raised concerns. The government has\u00a0scrapped its main green recovery measure, the green homes grant, which was intended to create thousands of green jobs by helping households to install insulation, and\u00a0cut incentives to buy electric cars.\\nConfirming a BBC report, Thunberg said the conference should be postponed \u201cif everyone could not attend in the same terms\u201d.

It was early evening in October 2019, and we had just finished an interview at a nearby hotel. The fashion designer Erdem Moralioglu had arrived with his twin sister Sara, to take Stipe to dinner, but Stipe wanted to check out the protest first. The crowd-phobic Erdem wasn\u2019t sure, but Stipe was almost skipping with excitement. Both scenes \u2013 heading off for a meal with his world-renowned artistic friend and mixing with young grungy activists \u2013 were exactly his thing.\\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\\nWe had met to discuss Stipe\u2019s second book of photography, Our Interference Times, which he\u2019d created with the author Douglas Coupland. It was a hefty tome that explored the dissonance between the analogue and the digital. (If that sounds pretentious, the book was very accessible.) It was a follow-up to Volume 1, published in 2018, made with curator Jonathan Berger. That book was more intimate: only 35 pictures, including ones of a young River Phoenix, and Kurt Cobain\u2019s hands.\\nNow, it\u2019s time for Stipe\u2019s third, which he made (mostly) on his own, to be called Michael Stipe. It\u2019s a mixture of portraits of friends, family and figures who inspire him; photographs by Stipe, plus images of pots and book jackets he commissioned to honour people he admires. He\u2019s speaking to me today from the New York apartment he shares with his long-term boyfriend Thomas (pronounced Tohma) Dozol, who is also a photographer. On our Zoom call, their apartment stretches out behind Stipe, open-plan, with a kitchen to the left and large windows to the right. Every inch of visible wall space has art on it; there are sculptures and piles of books. Dozol is padding around in the background, occasionally coming into view, and when he\u2019s about to leave the apartment, Stipe excuses himself to give him a kiss.\\nStipe, in square specs and a bright T-shirt, shows me his new book. \u201cThis is my only copy,\u201d he says. \u201cI had it in my backpack and I was walking from my studio. It was pissing rain and it got soaking wet. But look, it\u2019s held up well!\u201d He\u2019s proud of the book\u2019s toughness? \u201cYes, I am. I\u2019m proud of it full stop; it\u2019s such a beautiful piece.\u201d He flicks through the pages, holding them up to the camera with a smile. \u201cLook at the blue! It came out so well!\u201d His expression is constantly shifting, his feelings (pride, worry, humour) flickering across his face, like the shadows from moving clouds.\\nStipe, 61, is best known as a singer, but his band REM broke up in 2011. He\u2019s a full-on, all-in person, and the band (one of the most respected and influential indie bands ever) had been a full-on, all-in project for 31 years. For a while after the split he stopped making music altogether, though he has released a couple of singles, including No Time For Love Like Now with Aaron Dessner of The National, which came out in early 2020 and almost seemed to predict lockdown: \u201cWhen did this all begin to change?/The locked down memories can\u2019t sustain/this glistening, hanging free fall\u201d.\\nWhat he has done in his decade of non-music time is make art: mostly photography, though he also creates sculpture and video. The life of an artist suits him (\u201cIt feels like the real me; I don\u2019t find music particularly easy. Photography, for me, is much easier\u201d) and pre-pandemic, he would spend his days in New York in his studio. Though he keeps musician\u2019s hours, getting up at 11am and going to bed at 5am, creating physical items appeals to him. \u201cMy life\u2019s work with music is intangible,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s creativity that you cannot touch. And so making things that you can touch: a vase that you can hold, a book you can put it on the shelf, say\u2026 for me, that\u2019s fascinating.\u201d\\nHe has always taken photographs (some were used in REM\u2019s imagery) and he collects some, too. So his first and second books involved several archive pictures, but he planned for the third volume to be different: he would take a series of portraits of people he felt exhibited \u201cimmense strength, combined with a very open vulnerability\u201d. His wishlist of subjects was entirely comprised of women and included Patti Smith and Greta Thunberg.\\nHe started work on the book in 2019. First up was writer Joan Didion, but she declined his approach. Stipe didn\u2019t mind, but Didion\u2019s polite refusal led him to wonder if he could include her in a different way. For a while, he put that thought to one side, and concentrated on photographing those who had said yes. In his New York studio, he took pictures of Tilda Swinton. In Greenwich, London, at Erdem Moralioglu\u2019s wedding, he spontaneously snapped Beth Ditto.\\nAll the while, he was carrying some other pictures with him; photos he\u2019d recently taken of his friend John Giorno, an artist and poet, at Giorno\u2019s exhibition opening, in August 2019. Giorno, who was once Andy Warhol\u2019s lover, and appeared in REM\u2019s last music video (for We All Go Back To Where We Belong), died while Stipe was in Europe. His death changed the nature of Stipe\u2019s photography project. \u201cI had the rolls of film in my bag and the moment he died, I thought, I need to include John,\u201d he says. So he expanded the book\u2019s concept to include people other than women \u2013 \u201cto de-gender the project\u201d, as he puts it. All the people he wanted to feature \u201care, for me, insanely heroic. The work that they\u2019ve done, their activism, their art.\u201d\\nStipe\u2019s list of strong-but-vulnerable subjects grew. Meanwhile, his life (like everyone\u2019s) was about to shrink. Back in the US, in March 2020, Stipe was out of New York when Dozol tested positive for Covid-19 (he recovered well). He decided not to return immediately, and instead went to Athens, Georgia, where his mother, sister and uncle live: \u201cThe decision was about family,\u201d he says. \u201cMy mother had some difficult health issues.\u201d He ended up staying for a while.\\nAbruptly, Stipe had to become domestic: organising and caring, doing practical and maintenance jobs that he hadn\u2019t done for years. \u201cClimbing ladders, replacing lightbulbs, cleaning out gutters, mowing the lawn, doing the dishes, cleaning and mopping.\u201d How was that? \u201cIt takes up a lot of time,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd also, like everyone else, I found I couldn\u2019t concentrate. I couldn\u2019t focus on anything.\u201d\\nHe started listening to podcasts, which he had never done before, finding his way there via some taped conversations he had of Lou Reed talking to the music producer Hal Willner. Stipe\u2019s listening choices are very him: shows about art and queer issues. He loves 99% Invisible (about design), Your Undivided Attention (on the way social media manipulates us), Against Everyone (a countercultural show from former sex worker Conner Habib), Still Processing (a New York Times culture podcast), LaunchLeft (established artists recommend new ones, hosted by Rain Phoenix), Not Really (a gossipy gay New York podcast), Homo Sapiens (Alan Cumming and Christopher Sweeney\u2019s queer interview show), Talk Art (Russell Tovey and Robert Diament chat art collecting), and New Models. \u201cNew Models is this fascinating, very high level of academic conversation, about technology and activism, and politics, and art. They\u2019re talking in a language that is so above my pay grade. I feel the same as when I listen to Wagner. I don\u2019t know exactly what I\u2019m hearing, but I feel better and smarter for having listened to it.\u201d\\nListening to podcasts and doing his chores, he considered what to do with his new book. Under lockdown, he couldn\u2019t take anyone\u2019s photograph (he didn\u2019t want to do Zoom portraits) and couldn\u2019t collaborate with the artist/curator he had originally wanted to be involved. So he decided to work in a different way.\\nStipe had already commissioned some vases from a ceramicist called Caroline Wallner, with a view to using them in an art exhibition. He asked her to put names on them, and they became a way of making a portrait of some of the people he wanted in the book: Mick Jagger, Lou Reed and Cate Blanchett. He also got in touch with a New York printmaker he knew, and asked her to make some book covers with people\u2019s names on them (including Didion\u2019s). He rekindled an old interest in fonts, and designed some of his own. The book Michael Stipe is now a combination of new portraits, photos of vases and book covers with names on them and lists of names printed in fonts designed by Stipe.\\nIt\u2019s a lot freer than the original idea, and, in his head, has become a chronicle of lockdown. \u201cThe things that were impacting me wound up making their way in,\u201d he says. \u201cThe book just expanded and expanded.\u201d There\u2019s even a podcast-y element: if you scan the QR codes on various pages, they lead to audio recordings of Stipe musing on why he included certain pictures, his thinking behind their placement.\\nThe book becomes more about family as it goes on: pictures of close friends such as Sam and Aaron Taylor-Johnson give way to snaps of his sister and his mum \u2013 who is fine, despite the pandemic worries. \u201cMy mum\u2019s going gangbusters again, and she\u2019s great.\u201d On one page, there\u2019s a lovely vintage picture of a couple: these are Stipe\u2019s grandparents. \u201cMy grandmother and her brother would jump on the train from Mississippi and go to New Orleans on the weekend,\u201d says Stipe. \u201cShe had flapper clothes and she danced. That\u2019s her and my Papi, the two of them madly in love.\u201d He had another grandfather who, he says, was a preacher: \u201cAnd I know I can get very preacher-ilian and hectoring. I got it, too, I got it honest, as we say.\u201d\\nI wouldn\u2019t call Stipe hectoring: he just listens hard and answers carefully and fully. What he seems is sensitive, worried, unable to be glib. Stephen Colbert of the Late Show has described Stipe as \u201cvibrating in reaction to the world\u201d, and that seems right. As a singer, he seemed to mainline emotion; and though he has a light, almost flirty, social presence, he can\u2019t laugh off horrible politics or cruelty, or climate change. Actually, the world affects him so much that, a few years ago, he was advised by a therapist to stop watching the news; he came off social media around three years ago, too, and stayed off. He used to post jokey pictures of himself on Instagram with famous friends, but with the other person cropped out, so the image was just of him grinning madly. He hates social media now.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s so upsetting to me that it took the end of the years of Trump as president for Twitter and Jack Dorsey to finally decide that Trump had said something that was offensive on Twitter, and [his account] needed to be suspended,\u201d he says. \u201cThat platform allowed Trump a voice that put wind under his sails, and allowed for the type of disgusting behaviour that earmarks those years, and allowed a pandemic to run ravage across our country and across the world. It\u2019s an embarrassing and horrifying chapter of our history. This stupid male idea of power, it\u2019s so dumb.\u201d He warms to his theme: \u201cIt\u2019s saddo and dumdum. We\u2019re on a second-grade level here: Saddo and Dumdum. We\u2019re better than this. Americans, you know, we\u2019re particularly good at showing our asses publicly. But when I say we, I mean all of us. We\u2019re better than this.\u201d\\nThis is the preacher-ilian mode he was talking about earlier, and it hovers quite near the surface. Still, that\u2019s not to say he can\u2019t take a joke. When earlier this year the Guardian asked Stipe whom he would most like to apologise to, he said: \u201cAnyone I slept with before the age of 27, because I was a selfish, cold-ass bitch.\u201d Would he care to explain? \u201cWell, it was me trying to be funny,\u201d he says now, \u201cbut I was an incredibly insecure and selfish young man. I don\u2019t think I was pleasant to be around, and I don\u2019t think I was a very good lay. It took me the better part of my 20s to recognise that insecurities are actually a superpower, and something that I can utilise to allow my better work to come out of me. I don\u2019t have to be snipy and cynical. Cold-ass bitch was a coat that I put on to protect myself and I realised, I can take that coat off now.\u201d\\nIt sounds as if he was just scared. \u201cI\u2019m a very fearful person. Truthfully, a lot of what this book is about is the people who represent fearlessness to me.\u201d\\nWhen it comes to fearlessness, Stipe has always taken a lot of strength from his friendship with Patti Smith, whom he admired when he was young and is still delighted to be friends with. He shows me a mask of William Blake with writing scrawled over it; a gift from Smith. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who said to me, \u2018At some point, you need to walk unafraid\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I turned that phrase into a song about exactly that (REM\u2019s Walk Unafraid). But that fierce fearlessness is something that I still look to. To show me the way, to pull me away from the parts of myself that allow me to be absorbed into fear. And to run towards the thing that scares you the most. As a creative person, that\u2019s maybe a superpower.\u201d\\nBecause he admires artists so much, Stipe loves operating in a high-art friendship zone and enjoys telling tales about this, resulting in some heavy-duty name-dropping. For instance, he tells me that, every summer, he and Dozol go on holiday to France with the artist Sophie Calle. (There\u2019s a picture of Calle in the book, with the hotelier and businessman Paddy McKillen.) \u201cOh my God, I was terrified to meet Sophie at first,\u201d he says. \u201cHer work is amazing, ripping apart the facade that people put up and seeing what\u2019s behind it. But she\u2019s got this wicked, fierce sense of humour.\u201d\\nAnyway, one time, Calle was in New York and Stipe arranged to meet her at an art opening. He asked where she was staying, and she said, Canal Street, at Laurie Anderson\u2019s. And at that time, Stipe lived on Canal Street and was friends with Anderson; he was delighted by the coincidence. After the show, Anderson said, \u201cDo you mind if I call Lou?\u201d (Lou Reed, her husband, who died in 2013).\\n\u201cSo she called Lou, and he showed up, and then I was like, \u2018I told Patti Smith I was going to see her.\u2019 So Patti showed up, and my friend Tom Gilroy. We all sat there, in this little tapas bar in Soho. Lou Reed, Laurie Anderson, Sophie Calle, Patti Smith, myself, and my best friend, Tom.\u201d Stipe is clearly extremely chuffed with getting all these people together: \u201cLou and Tom were sat next to each other and they started talking about film. And then it went deep, into indie film-makers no one\u2019s ever heard of before. It was amazing to watch.\u201d\\nStipe is never happier than when he\u2019s in a room full of clever, artistic types. His life, pre-lockdown, was unbelievably social. \u201cYes, lockdown is the only time I\u2019ve never felt Fomo,\u2019 he says. \u201cI\u2019m always, \u2018Where\u2019s the party, where are the exciting people?\u2019\u201d His extended stay in Athens was a completely other life and it has taken a while to adjust back to the city. \u201cThis is a very different space to being in my house alone.\u201d\\nHe tells me about some parties where he met famous people. He went to a Vanity Fair Oscars do in the mid-1990s, invited by an agent friend, where he met Gore Vidal. \u201cHe\u2019s so tall. So handsome. He\u2019s fucking Gore Vidal. And I\u2019m like, looking up at him like this,\u201d \u2013 he pulls a face of extreme awe \u2013 \u201cMy reaction was to get away. I turned, and who was standing two feet from me? Nancy Reagan. With her hair all fluffed up. I screamed! I shrieked like a cartoon woman on a table with a mouse.\u201d\\nAt the dinner, he was sitting next to the film director William Friedkin, who didn\u2019t talk to him because Stipe wasn\u2019t in the movie business. But Stipe enjoyed himself anyway. \u201cI wound up drinking quite a lot. And I went around the room and I sat down with people. I was like, \u201cShirley MacLaine, I want to tell you about my dreams.\u201d I made a real mess of myself. But I did get to congratulate Dolly.\u201d (Dolly Parton was nominated for an Oscar for writing I Will Always Love You, Whitney Houston\u2019s version of which was in The Bodyguard.)\\nStipe has put a Parton vase in his book, opposite a Laurie Anderson one, because he thought they have a lot in common. \u201cI put people together in the that I thought would really appreciate each other\u2019s company.\u201d And this is what his book is about, I think; staging a vast virtual party, full of people that Stipe would like to see, or hang out with, or see hang out with each other; to meet even if they are dead. Lockdown has meant he can create his ideal event, full of the beautiful, the clever, the artistic, the brave, the activist. His family and everyone who inspires him, and he thinks we should admire. The best party ever.\\n\u201cWe need all of these minds, pushing us to be a better version of ourselves,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is our learning period. We\u2019ve just come through this terrible thing together that indicated how much we are all connected. I hope that what comes out of this is something that helps to elevate all of us, and to show ourselves to ourselves, show ourselves to each other.\u201d He realises he sounds a little Pollyanna-ish, and his expression changes again, silliness and self-deprecation scudding across: \u201cI know that I\u2019m like, head-in-the-sky guy, and it sounds really naive, but, you know: it really is all about love.\u201d\\nMichael Stipe is published on 29 April by damianieditore.com, priced at \u00a350.

Police clashed with \u201ckill the bill\u201d protesters in Bristol for the fourth time in a fortnight this weekend, as more than 1,000 people gathered to oppose the new legislation, bringing traffic to a standstill.\\nReading the contents of the 300-page bill can feel like being trapped in a 21st-century version of Animal Farm. Though the government says that everyone has equal rights, the bill reflects the subtext of this official line: only as long as citizens pipe down and do as they are told. While it says that \u201cfreedom of expression is a cornerstone of British democracy\u201d, the bill proposes amendments giving police greater powers to restrict protests that cause \u201cintimidation or harassment\u201d or \u201cserious unease, alarm or distress\u201d to bystanders.\\nThe point of protests is that they are unruly, noisy and a source of irritation to many. Without them, we might still have elections in which only rich white men could vote, and wealthy landowners might still curtail our rights to roam the countryside. The reason for the proposed restrictions, as the bill solemnly explains, is a recent change of protesting tactics, such as people gluing themselves to buildings and obstructing entrances. Since the large-scale Extinction Rebellion (XR) protests in April 2019, the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, has said she wants to change police powers to deal with protests. But there is little new about the civil disobedience methods used by XR, save perhaps for jauntier props.\\nThe police already have the power to impose some conditions on \u201cstatic\u201d protests such as assemblies and demonstrations (they can specify where such a protest can take place, for how long, and how many people can be involved). They have greater powers to control protest marches, including prohibiting marches if they are deemed disruptive to public order. The bill proposes widening the conditions imposed on static protests to match those on march protests.\\nBut are further police powers actually needed? A large body of criminal laws for policing protests, such as obstructing the highway or aggravated trespass, already exist. The rights to freedom of expression guaranteed by the European convention on human rights are \u201cqualified rights\u201d \u2013 meaning they may be interfered with to protect the rights of others or the wider public interest. This means that police must use their powers to restrict protests in a way that is proportionate, balancing issues such as public safety or the prevention of crime and disorder against people\u2019s right to protest.\\nRather than criminalising protesters, the police are supposed to work with them to use the least restrictive means of interfering with their rights. The Sarah Everard vigil on Clapham Common, for example, would have played out differently if the Metropolitan police had engaged more effectively with its organisers. Instead, police reacted forcefully against a vigil being held at all, and appeared to think that Covid emergency laws forbid all protests. Although emergency laws have undoubtedly caused confusion among police, they don\u2019t prohibit an individual\u2019s right to protest.\\nBritish policing is supposed to be founded on a philosophy of consent. Increasingly, this principle is being crushed under police boots. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill. Of course, not everything in this bill should be seen as a hand smashing down on civilians; the Law Commission has long recommended that the common law of public nuisance be replaced with a formal written statute, updating the language and making the offence clearer, for example.\\nBut there was no public debate prior to the bill\u2019s publication, which is a basic expectation for a piece of legislation with such far-reaching consequences. It was published just two days before the publication of another report, which analysed how effectively the police dealt with protests such as XR and Black Lives Matter, commissioned by Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services, the body responsible for inspecting the police force. This allowed little time for careful consideration of the latter report\u2019s findings.\\nAnother driver behind the bill is the cost of policing protests. The Met states that the cost of policing XR\u2019s 2019 April protests was more than \u00a316m. What these calculations overlook is the hidden expense of increasing police powers. In 2019, I defended in a trial where a police officer gave an XR protester the choice of moving away from the Intercontinental Hotel in London, where she was protesting about International Petroleum Week, which was taking place inside, or being arrested. She very politely said she would move away. The sergeant then overruled the officer, and the protester was arrested and detained in a police cell for 13 hours.\\nHer trial took place disjointedly, over months, in three different magistrates courts. She was acquitted in the end \u2013 but the far cheaper solution would have been to allow her to walk away quietly and peacefully, as she intended to do. Arresting peaceful protesters isn\u2019t just undemocratic: it\u2019s also an expensive waste of police resources. As for the disruption that protests cause to surrounding businesses, cafes certainly do a roaring trade in the midst of demonstrations. And no government can legitimately remove people\u2019s rights in order to increase the country\u2019s gross domestic product.\\nThe legitimacy of government has never been founded on the silence of its people. Muted protests, curbed by growing police powers, are anathema to both democracy and freedom. If the UK is to avoid a descent into narrow nationalism and repression, it needs to strengthen human rights, not diminish them. Here, history is a lesson. Protests have been vital to achieving change. If society is to make progress on issues such as violence against women, racism, poverty and the climate crisis, we must defend the rights of peaceful protesters.\\nKirsty Brimelow is a QC and barrister at Doughty Street Chambers", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de665a32dd4cf8e506ccd85ba04cda7f431ec3e9/0_197_5361_3217/master/5361.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Police officers and a protester at a \u201ckill the bill\u201d demonstration in Bristol on Saturday.

But we\u2019re just months away from hosting critical global climate talks, and this climate-wrecking mega project is clearly incompatible with our plans to cut emissions, so why only delay the decision and not just call it in now?

However, the\u00a0supreme court ruled last December\u00a0that the government\u2019s commitments under the\u00a02015 Paris agreement\u00a0could effectively be ignored in the decision to press ahead with a third runway at Heathrow.\\nA group of more than 130 prominent scientists, academics and lawyers, including former Nasa scientist James Hansen, and UK former chief scientist Sir David King, last week\u00a0wrote to the government expressing concern over the supreme court ruling, and warning that the government\u2019s international climate commitments were being ignored. They wrote: \u201cThe highest court in the UK has set a precedent that major national projects can proceed even where they are inconsistent with maintaining the temperature limit on which our collective survival depends. Indeed, the precedent goes further still. It says that the government is not bound even to consider the goals of an agreement that is near universally agreed. Not only does that undermine the UK\u2019s status as a champion of the Paris agreement just ahead of Cop26. It also substantially reduces humanity\u2019s prospects of maintaining that limit and hence averting disaster.\u201d\\nOther recent controversial decisions, such as the government\u2019s initial backing for the\u00a0Cumbrian coal mine, and a\u00a0new round of licences granted to extract oil and gas from the North Sea, have also raised concerns.

Among them was Sophie Backsen, 22, an agricultural science student from the North Frisian island of Pellworm, on Germany\u2019s North Sea coast, together with her younger brothers, Hannes, Paul and Jakob. Her parents, who run an organic farm on the island that Backsen hopes one day to manage, had taken a similar case to Berlin\u2019s administrative court two years ago, together with Greenpeace, but it had ruled against them.\\nThe Backsens were joined by two other families from the East Frisian island of Langeoog and another complainant from Brandenburg, all of whom are involved in either farming, sustainable tourism or both. In their complaint, they told the court they had all experienced first-hand the effects of the climate crisis, including flooding and heatwaves. The group also secured the support of Neubauer, Germany\u2019s Fridays for Future\u2019s main representative who is seen as the country\u2019s leading climate activist.\\nThe judges ruled that young people\u2019s \u201cfundamental rights to a human future\u201d were threatened and that the law in its current state jeopardised their freedom because the goals set were too focused on dates too far in the future. It said that it was only possible to reduce the rise in average global temperatures to between 1.5C and 2C \u2013 as set out in the 2015 Paris agreement \u2013 with \u201cmore urgent and shorter term measures\u201d.\\n\u201cThe challenged rules violate the freedoms of the complainants, some of whom are still very young,\u201d the judges said in a statement. They added: \u201cVirtually every freedom is potentially affected by these future emission reduction obligations because almost every area of human life is associated with the emission of greenhouse gases and is therefore threatened by drastic restrictions after 2030.\u201d\\nThe government responded quickly to the ruling, promising a swift implementation of changes to the law. The finance minister, Olaf Scholz, said he would begin work immediately with the environment ministry to make the amendments, which would then be put to the government for approval.\\nOliver Krischer, for the Green party, told the broadcaster Deutschlandfunk, the ruling was \u201cboth a slap and a wakeup call for the government to finally start on an ambitious climate protection policy\u201d.\\nClaudia Kemfert, an energy expert at the German Institute for Economic Research, called the ruling \u201ctrailblazing and historic\u201d. In future, decisions on all levels would have to be critically reviewed to see if they corresponded with long-term climate goals, she said.\\nPeter Altmaier, the minister for energy and the economy, called the ruling \u201cbig and significant\u201d. Despite criticism he faced for his role as one of the main authors of the law, he called it a welcome decision for the economy as it would help it \u201cplan for the future\u201d.\\nAltmaier said he was relieved that the court had supported the \u201cmost important\u201d obligation in his 2020 climate initiative, which required that reduction targets up to the year 2050 were \u201cbroken down into concrete reduction targets for each individual year between 2022 and 2050\u201d.\\nNeubauer said the climate lobby\u2019s success at Karlsruhe was only the beginning, emphasising that the five months leading up to the federal elections in September, in which the pro-environmental Greens have a good chance of entering government, would be crucial.\\n\u201cWe will continue to fight for a 1.5 degree policy which protects our future freedoms, instead of endangering them,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cgone are the days when we were called ignorant for demanding climate action\u201d.\\nUnder the 2019 law Germany is obliged to cut greenhouse gas emissions 55% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. Annual upper limits for greenhouse gas emissions across the energy, transport, agriculture and construction sectors are also set in the law. If targets are missed, there are penalties and the obligation to make more stringent improvements.\\nThis article was amended on 30 April 2021.

Marching to the beat of a samba band, crowds chanted: \u201cKill the bill\u201d and \u201cThe UK is not innocent.\u201d\\nThe Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy was among the speakers who addressed the crowd in the park. She said: \u201cThe police, crime, sentencing and courts bill should come as no surprise: it\u2019s part of an authoritarian drive from this government. We can see it in everything they have been doing recently, from voter ID registration to anti-union laws and now anti-protest laws.

A fast-paced march up Whitehall followed, pausing for a while at Trafalgar Square where more arrests were made, with police moving in in squads to snatch individuals. Several people said they had been pepper-sprayed by officers in the fracas.\\nSeveral hundred protesters then marched up the Strand and eventually a large group was trapped by several hundred officers in riot gear at Aldwych. Just before 9pm, police said they had made 26 arrests related to the protest on suspicion of offences including assault on police, breach of the peace and possession of an offensive weapon. Ten officers had been injured, none seriously, the Met said.\\nAddressing the reasons for the protest in a video posted on Twitter on Friday, Corbyn said: \u201cThe right to protest is precious.

So why don't we hear about it?", "subtitle": null, "text": "There are hundreds of local uprisings against developers \u2013 and it\u2019s starting to become a national issue\\nHow many local environment campaigns does it take for the issues they raise to be recognised as part of a national problem? Ten? Twenty, maybe? What about 100? Surely national media and politicians would have taken up the issues by then.\\nAs it turns out, there\u2019s far more than 100 local environmental campaigns going on right now. In just two weeks, more than 280 different groups across the UK have registered on a new National Grassroots Campaigns Map. Rosie Pearson, one of the founders, is astonished: \u201cWhen we set it up, it was really just to see what\u2019s out there. But we quickly realised there\u2019s a real hunger for sharing information, resources and support. We\u2019re witnessing a huge number of local groups facing the same issues.\u201d\\nI got a sense of the scale of this problem following an article I wrote about the assault on the countryside. I was deluged by local campaigns: Save Ferriby 2020, Save Culham Green Belt, Save West Grinstead, Keep Rookwood Green, to name but a few. But to see the visuals of this new map is shocking. There are huge housing developments and damaging infrastructure projects everywhere. It\u2019s clear that these are far from localised disputes. They are fighting the same battles: against huge unsustainable housing developments engulfing small towns; against the loss of greenbelt or protected wildlife areas; and against hypocritical councils who declare a climate emergency in one breath and order the destruction of carbon sequestering trees or marshland in another.\\nThese campaigns are David and Goliath struggles. Locals are amateurs with few resources up against well-paid barristers acting for bulk-housing builders or government inquiries, skilled at getting their way. I\u2019ve just been involved in one such unequal struggle: a protest, to Save York Gardens, which through February tried to prevent the felling of a magnificent, century-old black poplar tree standing on a run-down estate in a little park in Wandsworth, south London.\\nThe original \u201cregeneration\u201d plans protected the tree with a tree preservation order. But later, Taylor Wimpey, the developer, pushed to fell it to facilitate cable laying. For over three weeks, protesters, intimidated by private security guards, occupied the tree. The local community brought food, sang to the climbers, produced art and wrote poems for the tree. With no resources they also attempted to make a case at a bewildering online court hearing. And when the tree was eventually lost, they wept and came to pay their respects.\\nOther local campaigns, whether in idyllic countryside or urban estates, will recognise the wider issues here. The local community was powerless when faced by developer and council resources. Environmental legislation failed to protect the tree. The developer\u2019s offer to \u201cmitigate biodiversity loss\u201d was saplings in courtyards to replace a cathedral of a tree. Worst of all, much of the development will be buy-to-let flats that do nothing to solve the affordable homes crisis.\\nIt\u2019s not surprising that politicians downplay and \u201clocalise\u201d such protests as lacking national significance. Given the government\u2019s \u201cbuild, build, build\u201d agenda, it\u2019s best not to let voters know that what\u2019s happening to other communities will soon happen to them. But why isn\u2019t the media paying more attention, especially outlets with environment correspondents? There were a few headlines about \u201cgreedy\u201d Eton selling 500 acres of unspoilt countryside on the edge of the South Downs national park for 3,000 houses, but most environmental protests go unreported. So cumulative issues about the suburbanisation of the countryside, the scale of the loss of open space, and the catastrophic failure to protect our biodiversity, are simply not addressed.\\nLazy journalism means no one challenges the political myths behind the government\u2019s obsession with pouring concrete. The government claims it must reluctantly use greenfield sites to solve the housing crisis, but CPRE, the countryside charity, shows there are enough brownfield sites to meet housing targets. Damningly, CPRE also reveals that the building currently happening on green belt is not being used for affordable homes, but expensive executive-style houses.\\nAs for the developer requirement to \u201cmitigate\u201d their destruction with a net gain for biodiversity, new research from the Durrell Institute casts doubt on the promises.\\nMedia and politicians alike are also missing a huge story about the groundswell of environmental protest. The new campaigns map has revealed people who realise they are part of a wider movement, whether HS2 protesters, tree defenders, or campaigners for local nature reserves. A new politics is emerging, making allies of unexpected groups \u2013 from shire Tories to Extinction Rebellion, parents and the politically uninvolved \u2013 all united against eco-vandalism.\\nThe demise of the black poplar tree was marked by a sad vigil with music and poems. It was heartbreaking, but there was also hope. Local women of every background spoke movingly about the tree\u2019s value and what its loss represented. They made political connections between the greed of developers and the threat to the biosphere. And several committed themselves to joining other tree protests and new networks dedicated to protecting nature against the forces that have declared war on it.\\nRos Coward is professor emerita of journalism at Roehampton University\\n", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edc2608f62f0ca25548074fa2076e17f0fb89d4a/0_114_3849_2309/master/3849.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Activist Marcus Carambola in York Gardens, south London, February 2021."]], "author": ["Ros Coward"], "date": "2021-04-04"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/23/jury-acquits-extinction-rebellion-protesters-despite-no-defence-in-law": {"title": "Jury acquits Extinction Rebellion protesters despite \u2018no defence in law\u2019", "subtitle": null, "text": "Six activists cleared of causing criminal damage to Shell\u2019s London headquarters in 2019\\nSix Extinction Rebellion protesters have been cleared of causing criminal damage to Shell\u2019s London headquarters despite the judge directing jurors that they had no defence in law.\\nTwo of the group\u2019s co-founders, Simon Bramwell, 49, and Ian Bray, 53, were acquitted on Friday alongside Jane Augsburger, 55, Senan Clifford, 60, David Lambert, 62, and James \u201cSid\u201d Saunders, 41, after a trial at Southwark crown court.\\nThe six, who represented themselves, were also cleared of individual counts of having an article with intent to destroy or damage property, while a seventh protester, Katerina Hasapopoulos, 43, earlier pleaded guilty to criminal damage.\\nProsecutor Diana Wilson told jurors that each of the defendants deliberately sprayed graffiti or smashed windows of the Shell building in Belvedere Road, central London, on 15 April 2019.\\nThe protest, which saw activists pour fake oil, glue themselves to windows and doors, break glass, climb on to a roof and spray graffiti, was part of wider Extinction Rebellion demonstrations across the capital.\\nWilson said that while some protesters stood outside the building holding banners or speaking through megaphones, \u201cthese defendants went further\u201d, adding: \u201cThe seven involved caused significant damage.\u201d\\nAll those who stood trial explained they had targeted the Shell building because the oil giant was directly contributing to the climate crisis, thereby causing serious injury and death, and argued that it was a \u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201cproportionate\u201d response to the harm being caused.\\nClifford quoted Sir David Attenborough and former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams in his evidence.\\nHe said: \u201cI believe if I don\u2019t do whatever I can to protect our Earth, to protect life on this Earth, to stop the death and injury that is and will be happening, I\u2019m committing a crime, a really serious crime, and I\u2019m willing to break a window, to paint a message on a wall, I\u2019m willing to break the glass on that emergency button, even if some say that\u2019s a crime.\\n\u201cBecause this is a much bigger crime and I\u2019m trying to stop that crime, I\u2019m trying to protect life in the only way I feel I can.\u201d\\nJudge Gregory Perrins directed jurors that even if they thought the protesters were \u201cmorally justified\u201d, it did not provide them with a lawful excuse to commit criminal damage.\\nWith the exception of Saunders, who claimed in his defence that he honestly believed Shell\u2019s employees and shareholders would have consented to his criminal damage, the judge said: \u201cThey don\u2019t have any defence in law for the charges they face.\u201d\\nBut the jury of seven women and five men took seven hours and four minutes to acquit them of both charges.

She received a six-month conditional discharge and was ordered to pay \u00a3105 costs.\\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to do this and found it hard knowing that our actions in April were causing disruption and inconvenience to many people\u2019s lives,\u201d she told the court in her written statement. \u201cBut I felt impelled to act in the face of the catastrophic future I saw unfolding before us all.\u201d\\nShe said that since her daughter became pregnant with her first grandchild, \u201cdelight at this news has been overshadowed by fear of what kind of world this new little being will grow up in.\\n\u201cI decided that I couldn\u2019t live with myself if I didn\u2019t do everything I could to avoid what was looking like a sleepwalk to disaster, leaving a planet unfit to live on for all future generations.\u201d\\nJill Whitehouse, 66, a retired teacher from Exeter, was also arrested during the April protests in Parliament Square. She received a conditional discharge and \u00a3110 costs.\\n\u201cAt my time in my life I\u2019ve got nothing to lose by joining in,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity for us to make reparations for the damage that we\u2019ve done to the environment.\u201d\\nThere were lots of young people on the frontline of the XR protests too \u2013 some of whom were prepared to be arrested. For them this was not just a case of defending future generations, it was about a visceral fight for their own survival \u2013 and part of a wider struggle for global climate justice.\\nEve Merrall, 25, a zoology master\u2019s graduate from Sheffield, was arrested in Parliament Square in April 2019.\\n\u201cI am not talking about future generations, people are suffering and dying now \u2026 if we keep silent and do not act then we are complicit in their deaths,\u201d she told the court.\\n\u201cThis is where we get to decide what we\u2019re made of, to fight for everything that we love. We have an opportunity to build a better and more just world that respects life and shares resources evenly and sustainably. I believe in a better future and I will continue to fight for it. I hope you will join me.\u201d\\nSome of those who ended up in court had been involved in the environmental movement for years and a few had been arrested before. But for most this was their first brush with the law \u2013 and in some cases their first protest.\\nSeveral had been working on the climate crisis for years either as scientists, researchers or campaigners. But their testimony shows they had grown exasperated that, after years of signing petitions, going on protests and writing to their MPs, nothing had changed.\\nJames Ryle, 53, a university project manager from Bristol, had worked on environmental issues for a quarter of a century \u2013 from a conservation volunteer to \u201csustainability adviser\u201d to corporations, governments and the United Nations.\\nBut he told the court: \u201cI\u2019ve become increasingly despairing at the lack of meaningful government action to address climate change. The truth is, nothing has changed and so things have just got worse.\u201d\\nHe said the manmade catastrophes happening now were causing \u201cuntold human misery and loss\u201d and were also a warning \u201cof much, much worse to come\u201d if only people would listen.\\nRyle said he had no intention of getting arrested when he joined the XR protests, planning instead to \u201chelp with outreach to members of the public\u201d.\\nHe added: \u201cBut on Good Friday afternoon \u2013 sitting in front of the pink boat listening to moving testimonies from climate refugees, mothers, nurses and young people living in fear for their futures \u2013 something different happened,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt suddenly and deeply the exquisite vulnerability connecting me with the millions around the world already suffering as a result of climate breakdown \u2026 In that moment of clarity, I realised I had no other choice but to break the law.\u201d\\nRyle was given a six-month conditional discharge and \u00a3105 costs.\\nFor others, the protests and subsequent arrests were a family affair.\\nTim and Sue Ponton, who have just celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary, were arrested together twice \u2013 once on Waterloo Bridge in April 2019 and then again outside the private jet centre at London City airport during another XR protest later that year.\\nSue, a former civil servant, said she was \u201cdriven to join XR\u201d after 30 years of \u201cwriting to and petitioning politicians and getting nowhere\u201d.\\n\u201cI am really concerned for my children, my family and friends\u2019 children, grandchildren and all children and young people around the world, as temperatures and sea levels rise,\u201d she said in her court statement, adding: \u201cI feel sad that politicians appear to listen more to lobbyists rather than scientists.\u201d\\nTim, a former NHS orthotist, said he felt \u201coutraged that successive governments\u201d had failed to protect him and his family from \u201cimpending economic and social breakdown and potential human extinction\u201d.\\nHe added: \u201cI feel deeply saddened that each and every day over 200 species become extinct, losing our vital ecological balance and many potential solutions to human problems for ever. I feel incredulity that intelligent people in high public and corporate office continue to deny the reality of scientific fact and conduct business as usual.\u201d\\nThe photographs of XR activists who have been through the court system show a diversity of age, gender and, to some extent, occupation. But those pictured are almost exclusively white \u2013 highlighting an ongoing criticism of XR and the wider climate movement.\\nZo\u00eb Blackler from XR said this was something the movement was working to address but that it reflected a broader, structural issue.\\nShe said police data showed one in 10 of those arrested during the April protests were from ethnic minorities, but that most appeared to have pleaded guilty remotely rather than attend court, and of those that did come to court, most asked not to be identified.\\n\u201cAnd while of course we acknowledge the lack of diversity within the movement and are doing all we can to become more inclusive, the disproportionate number of white defendants does reflect a much broader problem of racism in our society, that means some people are excluded from public protest, and from speaking out about it, through fear of police violence and targeting by the media,\u201d Blackler said.\\nThere are still more than 1,000 prosecutions progressing through the courts, although there is growing pressure on the government from civil rights groups and climate scientists not to waste time and money prosecuting peaceful climate protesters in the midst of an ecological emergency.\\nBlackler said that whatever the government did to crack down on legitimate protest \u2013 most recently in its controversial crime and policing bill \u2013 the determination of ordinary people to make their voice heard and to demand urgent, far-reaching action on climate justice would not be denied.\\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned from this unique moment in British legal history is that ordinary people will act in extraordinary ways, to make their voices heard and demand the urgent, systemic changes needed to safeguard all our futures.\u201d", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b17c0c42b639750064622c64bba4ba4e64bc6c61/0_0_7155_4001/master/7155.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Portraits of 141 Extinction Rebellion protesters who were arrested"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8691fb5d74318a10673ce9d1d208a5f395219491/0_0_4523_3015/master/4523.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Police officers carry away an Extinction Rebellion protester on Waterloo Bridge in London in April 2019"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdbda42b6c446ca4181b9afeb05749540e114e9c/0_0_3000_2003/master/3000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Stephanie Howlett"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e94c7acf3ab4c3e8698d7a83997543b3c792052/0_0_3000_2003/master/3000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Jill Whitehouse"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd54f3dbdf6fe2efd4bb9edc52201b832120a948/0_0_3000_2003/master/3000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Eve Merrall:"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fb1b78f56aed8d225beea15ebf8327d909897bc/0_418_2003_1624/master/2003.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "James Ryle"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ea4bbc5b29f83d0ddd6fedf5ebd359be03f2b41/0_0_3000_2003/master/3000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Tim and Sue Ponton"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90b8c6af86f7cfeb9193ee7d84332f4994fa3e10/0_203_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Reparations Rebellion and Brixton Extinction Rebellion protesters during the Afrikan Emancipation Day Reparations march in Brixton, London on 1 August 2020"]], "author": ["Matthew Taylor"], "date": "2021-04-29"}}
