It\u2019s now seen as a means of coping with the present, thanks to psychology-minded practitioners like Jessica Dore\\nWhen Jessica Dore was growing up, her mother had a tarot deck from which she\u2019d pull cards \u2013 much to the mounting mortification of her daughter. As a child, Dore went along with it as fortune-telling fun. But \u201cas an adolescent, it was sort of like \u2018Mind your own business\u2019\u201d, she says wryly.\\nIt meant Dore was at least familiar with tarot. The deck of 78 cards, split between major arcana and minor arcana (\u201cgreater\u201d and \u201clesser secrets\u201d), is used with varying degrees of sincerity to divine past, present and future. \u201cBut I never had any sense that it could be something that would be of value for me in my life,\u201d Dore says.\\nThen, a decade later, Dore threw a dinner party to which two friends brought along a tarot deck. They gave her an \u201camazing\u201d reading, she says, that cast new light on a hard time she was going through. \u201cThe cards made me feel seen and understood in a way that I wasn\u2019t used to.\u201d The experience opened her mind to the potential of tarot to shift perspectives and illuminate possibility. She acquired a deck of her own, and started pulling cards after work each night.\\nAt the time Dore was in her early 20s, a poet with a communications degree working as a publicist at a publisher of self-help and psychology textbooks. She had been struck by how the research she encountered through her job could help people to gain new insight into their thoughts, feelings and behaviours \u2013 if only they knew to seek it out.\\nTarot, she thought, could be a similar conduit to awareness and introspection. These two strands \u2013 barriers to self-help, and tarot as a path to it \u2013 travelled together in Dore\u2019s mind, culminating in a \u201cstrange and unlikely marriage\u201d: she became a licensed social worker and full-time tarot reader.\\nOn Twitter, more than 130,000 people (along with 52,000 on Instagram) follow Dore\u2019s daily draw of a card, which she then connects to psychological concepts, legends, myths and miscellanea as a prompt for introspection.\\nShe links the five of cups, for example, to cognitive flexibility training, proposing expanding one\u2019s thinking as a path away from triggering thoughts; while the sun card could illuminate healthy responses to rejection.\\nToday's card. Sometimes it's helpful to reframe difficult experiences in a more \"positive\" light, but it's tricky to do so w/o treating painful thoughts & feelings as wrong or inferior, or trying to avoid them. What if u could know there are many ways to see it & feel how u feel. pic.twitter.com/60mD60ABOL\\nNow Dore has expanded on her cerebral writing on \u201cthe human experience through tarot\u201d in a book, Tarot For Change: Using the Cards for Self-Care, Acceptance and Growth. With this practical, carefully referenced guide, Dore brings together the scientific and the arcane, two spheres long believed to be antithetical \u2013 but increasingly less so.\\nTarot is among a range of mystic practices to have seen a mainstream resurgence in recent years. Most obvious is astrology, now almost adjacent to psychoanalysis in our shared lexicon \u2013 but there\u2019s also psychics, reincarnation, supportive spiritual energies (such as with manifesting), and even witchcraft.\\nIn 2018, the Pew Research Centre found that six in 10 Americans (both with religious affiliations and not) held at least one new age belief. Among the explanations given have been the internet connecting subcultures and people with alternative views, fashion houses bringing their imagery to the fore, and the decline in Christianity and community in the west.\\nAbove all, this new dawn of the new age has been framed as a response to widespread anxiety and sociopolitical instability; as an attempt to find meaning in an impervious, chaotic world.\\nIt is now possible to book tarot readings directly over Instagram \u2013 @thehoodwitch Bri Luna (who has 470,000 followers) and @thelionnessoracle Alejandra Luisa Leo\u0301n each charge around $140 an hour \u2013 or learn to read the cards yourself, with free resources such as Brigit Esselmont\u2019s @biddytarot community, or the Labyrinthos online school and app.\\nOn TikTok, tarot cards are drawn by algorithms. Even the Sun newspaper recently published its own guide to major and minor arcana, a surefire sign of steady online search traffic for spiritual guidance.\\nBut tarot as practiced by Dore does not so much provide answers as it generates more questions. \u201cYou\u2019re not predicting the future \u2013 you\u2019re really just exploring, looking at the images and activating the imagination,\u201d she says over Zoom from her home in Philadelphia.\\nDore likens drawing cards to yoga: a daily discipline of self-care, containing \u201cprofound spiritual data\u201d to be experienced rather than intellectualised. \u201cI came to tarot needing to figure out how to take better care of myself, how to check in with myself, to show up for myself,\u201d she says. (Indeed, Dore does two hours of Ashtanga yoga each morning, after 45 minutes\u2019 journalling \u2013 if the unexamined life is not worth living, hers is hard-won.)\\nWhen she started her nightly ritual of drawing cards, Dore found that what emerged gave shape to her thoughts and feelings in the same way as a writing prompt might. The eight of swords \u2013 communicating a sense of feeling victimised, or trapped \u2013 for instance, might cause Dore to reflect on whether she was avoiding any difficult emotions.\\nAs well as serving as a prompt for introspection, the cards\u2019 storied past made Dore think of history repeating \u2013 circular narratives and mirror images through literature, folklore and legends. \u201cIt felt very nourishing for me, just to be like: \u2018Someone drew this illustration; someone created these various interpretations \u2013 that means that I\u2019m not alone.\u2019\u201d\\nConsidered in this light, tarot has more in common than one might think with therapy. As Dore points out, Carl Jung studied archetypes, symbols and synchronicity in seeking to understand the human psyche.\\nToday, cognitive behavioural therapy \u2013 widely used as a treatment for depression and anxiety \u2013 focuses on changing the way you think in order to support your wellbeing. And other evidence-based models lean heavily on metaphors to bring about change (acceptance and commitment therapy).\\nAs a set of images and ideas derived from ancient wisdom, tarot has similar potential for transformation and growth, says Dore. She refers to the American psychologist James Hillman\u2019s definition of \u201cpsychologizing: whenever reflection takes place in terms other than those presented\u201d.\\nDore is clear about the limits to this: tarot is not therapy, just as she is not a therapist (though she received clinical training as part of her master\u2019s degree). But that is not to say there is no therapeutic benefit to projecting our inner lives on to a card.\\n\u201cLanguage can get you stuck, and it can get you unstuck,\u201d says Dore. \u201cTarot is a set of metaphors that can help somebody understand something: I could just say it to you, or you could look at an image and it might really sink in.\u201d\\nAfter nearly 100 years of work to ground psychology in evidence and empirical studies, we might see such idiosyncratic influences as outside the scientific scope. But all through human history, spirituality has factored into concepts of mental health and wellbeing \u2013 not necessarily reductively.\\nOne upshot of the 21st-century embrace of \u201cwellness\u201d is mounting awareness and acceptance of the real benefits of non-clinical practices such as meditation, yoga, spending time in nature, journalling and mind-altering drugs.\\nTarot might be seen in kind, says Dore \u2013 as an intervention rooted in a mystic tradition, like mindfulness. It is possible to accept \u201cother ways of knowing\u201d, she suggests, without denying or undermining science.\\nCertainly, the care and palpable sense of responsibility with which Dore approaches her work might surprise those who see tarot as essentially exploitative, the pastime of the cretinous and the credulous. The dismissal of tarot \u2013 and likewise astrology, another interest popular among young women \u2013 is often suggestive of whose suffering is taken seriously.\\nDore does not see herself as working within an explicitly feminist context. But she suggests that people who don\u2019t feel represented in accepted paradigms, or included in clinical settings, could benefit the most from alternative approaches to healing. (Dore completed a year-long internship at an eating disorder clinic, where the cards were used to \u201camazing\u201d effect.)\\n\u201cFor those people who don\u2019t feel spoken to by some of the interventions that are evidenced-based, tarot makes a doorway for people to show up and say: \u2018Here\u2019s what I need\u2019, instead of telling them: \u2018Here\u2019s what you need\u2019,\u201d she says.\\nThe goal is not to throw out facts, truth or science, says Dore \u2013 but to make room for magic, long \u201crelegated to the edges\u201d. Her preferred definition is from the anonymous Christian author of the Meditations on the Tarot: using the subtle to influence the dense.\\nIn psychological terms, that could simply mean greater awareness of how our thoughts and emotions (the subtle) shape our actions and behaviours (the dense).\\nIn a world that did not draw so hard a line between science and spirituality, Dore suggests, \u201cmaybe we would better understand our behaviours as consumers, as activists; the jobs that we choose, the things that we spend our time doing. What are these things serving? At what altars are we worshipping? It seems very idealistic \u2013 but that\u2019s the way I think about it.\u201d\\nAs it is, the current trend for tarot has seen it absorbed and repackaged by the mindless forces of capitalism it aims to counter. Where Pamela Colman Smith \u2013 the illustrator of the ubiquitous Rider-Waite tarot deck \u2013 died penniless and uncelebrated, there are now tarot decks themed from everything from cats to Disney villains.\\nUrban Outfitters sells a tarot-themed colouring book (or \u201cpersonal growth colouring journey\u201d), and a \u201cspiritually uplifting\u201d cocktail set, with \u201ctequila-inspired meanings for all 78 cards\u201d. At the higher end, Dior debuted \u201ctarot dresses\u201d for its spring 2021 couture line. You can even have your cards read at Selfridges of London.\\nAs the German philosopher Theodor Adorno wrote in 1953, of the popularity of astrology: \u201cthe kind of retrogression highly characteristic of persons who do not any longer feel to be the self-determining subjects of their fate, is concomitant with a fetishistic attitude towards the very same conditions which tend to be dehumanizing them\u201d.\\nDore, too, writes of the chariot card and the limits to willpower: \u201cCapitalism isn\u2019t built to teach pathfinding; it\u2019s built to teach compliance within a preset path.\u201d But she suggests that tarot could reveal another way \u2013 as stories and symbols have always done, separate from any question of whether they are rooted in fact.\\n\u201cI would challenge you to consider that this set of images \u2013 that are derived straight from mythology and folktales and fairytales in many cases, and even religion and spirituality \u2013 might also have meaning too, if you can step out of the rigid mindset.\u201d\\nEven if magic is a leap too far, in \u201creclaiming the imagination from the grips of doubt and rationalism\u201d, tarot may at least allow us to imagine a better world: the first step to creating it.\\nAn ideal of tarot is to experience the \u201ctotality of things\u201d, says Dore: where nothing is black and white, even seeming opposites are identical in nature, and \u201call things, no matter how seemingly conflicted, can exist together\u201d. This bears striking resemblance to many Indigenous world-views \u2013 increasingly being recognised as vital in the fight against the climate crisis.\\nThe Extinction Rebellion co-founder Gail Bradbrook and feminist scholar Angela Davis have likewise spoken of something akin to Dore\u2019s definition of magic in their activism: the possibility of achieving what seems impossible now.\\nTarot simply asks that we hold ourselves open to it, says Dore. \u201cThe beautiful thing about tarot is that you will meet the card where you\u2019re ready to go.\u201d\\nTarot for Change: Using the Cards for Self-Care, Acceptance and Growth by Jessica Dore is published by Penguin Life/Viking for $27.00 US / \u00a314.99 from October 26, 2021", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ee7ff5fd742fd0384a2837cec5e3f99e82f0769/0_236_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Jessica Dore arranges tarot cards at her home in Pennsylvania. \u2018Tarot is a set of metaphors that can help somebody understand something.\u2019"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1eee5d299d48e1fd890c688da71d3d202c4b32d6/0_239_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Jessica Dore holds tarot cards at her home in Pennsylvania. \u2018You\u2019re not predicting the future \u2013 you\u2019re really just exploring.\u2019"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1224d7172d0fb6d5523e49f94cbddd8997170441/0_0_3515_5262/master/3515.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Jessica Dore sits for a portrait at her home."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9bfd3a88c2ad621bb56acbc2b2239d937bf4aed/0_0_5807_3871/master/5807.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Various pieces of artwork and old glass bottles at Jessica Dore\u2019s home."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6df0c1856b3c159df4d52d97cea759b380037441/0_309_5241_3145/master/5241.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Tarot cards, part of a deck of 78."]], "author": ["Elle Hunt"], "date": "2021-10-27"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/oct/19/alan-carr-review-saucy-riffs-and-showbiz-tales": {"title": "Alan Carr review \u2013 saucy riffs and showbiz tales", "subtitle": null, "text": "Milton Keynes theatreGood albeit digressive gags keep the routines endearingly amusing in the comic\u2019s new touring show Regional Trinket\\n\u201cI hate being camp,\u201d says Alan Carr, which would be surprising if true \u2013 his signature style having secured TV ubiquity and national-treasure levels of affection. (His show title, Regional Trinket, riffs on the latter status.) But the thought of Carr unhappy in his camp skin need not long detain us. It is, like everything else he says onstage, a gambit of only the most fleeting significance, this one volunteered mainly to justify a saucy riff on no one fancying effeminate men.\\nThere\u2019s certainly no one in the audience hating on camp Carr: after all, it\u2019s an attitude he wears lightly and deploys to fine effect, in a show recounting \u2013 very digressively \u2013 his recent wedding and married life. One might wish \u2013 I occasionally do \u2013 for a glimpse of some hidden depth of feeling, if only for variety\u2019s sake. But, even as Carr ranges across meaty matter such as his husband\u2019s alcoholism and (briefly) Extinction Rebellion, nothing disturbs the prevailing tone of animated superficiality.\\nHappily, the jokes are good, and Carr\u2019s sense of his own ridiculousness as endearing as ever. From the opening story, in which a fellow train passenger contrives, with his testicles alone, to delete from Carr\u2019s laptop the script for this show, we\u2019re in the hands of a man with a flair for the arresting image. In a show that\u2019s lavish with showbiz anecdote, a choice gag follows about why Carr agreed to appear on Who Do You Think You Are? before a joke about his secret non-binary past that ends with the deathless punchline \u201c\u2026 and that\u2019s how Gabrielle lost her eye!\u201d\\nThe show\u2019s ostensible focus is his recent wedding \u2013 officiated by Adele, no less \u2013 and married life on a Kentish farm. It all sounds very bijou \u2013 or would if Carr weren\u2019t scouring the glamour for truffles of indignity and squalor, like the droll section on night-time supermarket staff. So as we flit from LA nuptials via hobnobbing with Celine Dion to a Mexico honeymoon, Carr focuses instead on his ego, his flab and his bald patch.

When pressed to make specific pledges or to stop lobbying against climate initiatives, all four executives declined.\\nThe chair of the House oversight committee, Representative Carolyn Maloney, pressed Woods about statements by his predecessor, Exxon CEO Lee Raymond, who in the 1990s said the scientific evidence for climate change was \u201cinconclusive\u201d and that \u201cthe case for global warming is far from air tight\u201d. In 2002, Exxon ran advertisements in the New York Times calling climate science \u201cunsettled\u201d.\\nMalone put it to Woods that Exxon\u2019s own scientists had repeatedly warned the company about the threat from burning fossil fuels as far back as the 1970s.\\n\u201cThere is a clear conflict between what Exxon CEO told the public and what Exxon scientists were warning privately for years,\u201d she said.\\nWoods denied that Raymond or Exxon misled anyone.\\n\u201cI do not agree that there was an inconsistency,\u201d he said.\\nMaloney said the response reminded her of \u201canother hearing that we had with the tobacco industry\u201d.\\n\u201cThey said they did not believe that nicotine was addictive. Well, it came out that they lied. Tobacco nicotine was very addictive. And now I\u2019m hearing from you that the science that was reported publicly, where your executives were denying climate change, we know that your scientists internally were saying that it\u2019s a reality,\u201d she said.\\n\u201cSo I was hoping that you would not be like the tobacco industry was and lie about this.\u201d\\nThe heads of the American operations of the other oil companies \u2013 Shell, Chevron and BP \u2013 also denied they misrepresented climate science or deceived the public.\\nThey each said that they recognised global heating was a reality and a major challenge. But the executives did not accept that their companies had failed to take it seriously or that they were undermining attempts to cut greenhouse gases by funding trade groups pouring millions of dollars into lobbying Congress against tighter environmental laws.\\n\u201cWe accept the scientific consensus,\u201d said Michael Wirth, the CEO of Chevron. \u201cClimate change is real. Any suggestion that Chevron is engaged in disinformation and to mislead the public on these complex issues is simply wrong.\u201d\\nBut Maloney accused the oil companies of continuing the cover-up, including by hiding documents. She said she would take the unusual step of issuing subpoenas to force the firms to reveal what they knew.\\n\u201cWe need to get to the bottom of the oil industry\u2019s disinformation campaign and with these subpoenas we will,\u201d she said.\\nThe oil and gas industry, which spent about $100m on political lobbying last year, was strongly backed by a number of Republicans on the committee who sought to distract by denouncing Joe Biden\u2019s energy policies.\\nRepublicans called their own witness, Neal Crabtree, who said he lost his job as a welder within three hours of Biden being sworn in as president because the Keystone pipeline was cancelled. Crabtree was used to portray Biden as colluding with China and Russia against America\u2019s oil industry.\\nThe highest-ranking Republican on the committee, Representative James Comer, questioned the legitimacy of the investigation. He said the committee would be better off spending its time investigating the White House\u2019s handling of inflation, illegal immigration and the US military withdrawal from Afghanistan.\\nIn a hearing meant to focus on climate misinformation, several Republican members openly questioned the urgency of the climate crisis. Representative Clay Higgins called the hearing \u201ca threat from within\u201d because the American way of life was built on oil.\\nAnother Republican member said Maloney owed the oil executives an apology for intruding on their right to free speech by pressing them to make a commitment that their firms will \u201cno longer spend any money, either directly or indirectly, to oppose efforts to reduce emissions and address climate change\u201d.\\nNone of the executives would make a direct commitment.\\nMaloney showed the hearing a video secretly recorded by Greenpeace earlier this year of an Exxon lobbyist describing the oil giant\u2019s backing for a carbon tax as a public relations ploy intended to stall more serious measures to combat the climate crisis.\\n\u201cHow did Exxon respond?\u201d asked Maloney. \u201cDid they come clean about this shocking conduct?

The planet is heating because we\u2019re adding gigatonnes of greenhouse gases into our habitat. The consequences get worse for every additional gram we displace from deep underground and send into the sky, through the dual actions of extraction and combustion. We know with certainty that the impacts \u2013 inflicted already and inevitably due if we don\u2019t stop fast \u2013 are gruesome and visceral.\\nAs the world recovers from Covid-19, so too does fossil fuel use. It\u2019s largely unsurprising, considering how little real work was done to decouple human existence from the burning of carbon. Not only do these gases accumulate in the atmosphere, the amount we add each year is itself increasing. That is to say: it\u2019s getting worse quicker.\\nIn the midst of this terrifying climbing curve, it is understandable that we instinctively seek out positive signs. Recently News Corporation, a long-time blocker of climate action, loudly proclaimed a grand turnaround in its attitude. The \u201cMission Zero\u201d campaign wrapped the smiling faces of miners, billionaires and government advisers around the paper.\\nThis campaign must be seen entirely within the context of the outlet\u2019s legacy on climate. It is an ugly record.\\nAccording to one recent study, the climate science reporting in News Corp\u2019s Australia outlets was the worst compared to New Zealand, Canada, UK and US media. The Daily Telegraph and the Courier Mail scored second and fourth worst in terms of climate science disinformation between 2005 and 2019. Even in the midst of the Black Summer bushfires, the Australian published an op-ed declaring: \u201cThere are no carbon emissions. If there were, we could not see because most carbon is black.\u201d This sits alongside campaigns to frame renewable energy as too unreliable, too expensive and even causing \u201cwind turbine syndrome\u201d.\\nNews Corp has played a major role in ensuring a truly catastrophic track record for emissions in Australia over the past decade. Though the Labor party\u2019s 2009 to 2014 renewable policies resulted in some ongoing reductions, those are easily erased by ballooning coal and gas mining projects and a growing fleet of city-choking combustion engine vehicles. Only a deadly pandemic has resulted in a meaningful drop in fossil emissions in Australia.\\nDespite the shiny cover, the \u201cMission Zero\u201d campaign makes a show of repeating many of the climate-delay talking points that have caused so much damage over the past decade. \u201cThe sun doesn\u2019t always shine and the wind doesn\u2019t always blow \u2026 some energy experts believe we will still need gas- and coal-fired power to keep the lights on 24/7.\u201d That\u2019s severely disconnected from the modern realities of electricity generation, in which zero carbon grids are theoretically understood and practically getting closer every day.\\nAnother example involves News Corp uncritically repeating the greenwashing campaigns of some of Australia\u2019s most severe emitters. AGL Energy has openly decided to breach a 1.5C-aligned trajectory by keeping its coal plants open well into the 2040s. Ditto for Energy Australia and Alinta Energy, both justifying this on the grounds that shutting down coal would cause \u201cblackouts\u201d. It\u2019s the worst of corporate climate delay, but it\u2019s heralded as if it\u2019s a grand turnaround on climate.\\nThe campaign avoids the biggest and most serious problems within Australia\u2019s climate footprint. In May, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released a pathway to global net zero by 2050, one that pointedly does not rely on dodgy offsets or uninvented technologies. Australia breaches nearly every single requirement for this pathway. The IEA calls for no new fossil-fuel mining projects \u2013 Australia has 72 new coalmining projects planned, and 44 LNG, gas or petroleum extraction projects, as of November last year.\\nThe IEA\u2019s report also calls for the end of coal power by 2030, with clean grids by 2035. The grid operator\u2019s best-case scenarios see Australia blowing past that target. And the IEA\u2019s criteria of a combustion engine sale ban by 2035 in rich countries has no chance of being endorsed by the current government.\\nFor Australia, the abysmal 2030 emissions target of 26% (of 2005 levels) by 2030 needs to be axed. A real trajectory to align with a 1.5C warming limit would mean a reduction of around 74% by 2030, according to a report by the Climate Targets Panel.\\n\u201cMission Zero\u201d mentions none of these things. The company has a trophy wall of climate policy scalps \u2013 carbon pricing, a vehicle efficiency standard, home insulation and badly-damaged renewable targets. But when the time calls for them to propose and argue in favour for new policy, they revert to vague promises about technology, and an absolution narrative for the country\u2019s worst emitters.\\nIt\u2019s worth noting that even though the prices of renewables have fallen precipitously, this doesn\u2019t guarantee emissions reductions. Coal and gas need to get out the way, and deployment of renewables needs to be managed to ensure grid reliability. Ditto for the falling price of electric vehicles, which will only drip-feed into vehicle stock at a painfully slow pace without massive government intervention, such as the UK\u2019s 2030 combustion engine ban.\\nMedia outlets in the UK, including those outside the Murdoch stable, have undergone similar transformations. In February this year, Greenpeace, WWF and Friends of the Earth signed up to the Daily Express\u2019 \u201cGreen crusade\u201d. Ten days after that, the Express was back to attacking Greta Thunberg. Without clear signs of a real, fundamental change, we can surely expect the same of News Corp.\\nWe know what a real revelation would look like. It would look like grief, not smarm and gloss. It would involve a genuine acknowledgement of how their actions have caused irreversible harm to human life, on a scale no other media organisation on the planet could ever aspire to. And it would acknowledge that the years of delay they wrought have resulted in a tripling, no, a quadrupling of the urgency with which we need to act today.\\nNews Corp leans on its monopolistic grip on Australian media to ensure that delivering the bare minimum on climate is met with nervous applause from players trapped under their all-encompassing umbrella. This cruel power dynamic hasn\u2019t changed.\\nIn the not-guaranteed event that News Corp is faced with a political opposition that proposes real, substantial emissions cuts aligned with global climate goals, it will revert back to its comfort zone: adding climate policy scalps to its trophy wall. We know this because nothing fundamental has changed.\\nIt doesn\u2019t know the damage it did. And it doesn\u2019t know the damage it could still do, once the shine comes off its politically-charged greenwashing campaign.\\nKetan Joshi is a freelance writer and communications consultant specialising in climate and energy who has worked for private and government clean-energy organisations in Australia.

At the Guardian, this is rapidly changing, as the emergency sprawls into more and more aspects of our daily lives, from food to fashion, football to finance, art to agriculture.\\nHere, 10 Guardian journalists describe how the climate crisis is changing their job.\\nThe Guardian\u2019s business team, including our transport and energy correspondents, devotes a significant part of its coverage to environment and the climate crisis. For companies, these are no longer optional considerations \u2013 they must embed them into their ways of working, and plan for significant changes in the years ahead.\\nIn a similar way, the environment is at the heart of the stories we tell. We hold businesses to account on environmental pledges, ferreting out greenwashing, investigating conflicts of interest, exploring myriad subsidy schemes and interrogating the details. We tell the stories of lives and communities that are affected by the climate crisis as industries such as oil and gas and automotive manufacturing are upended.\\nWe also explore the economic impact of these changes, how governments and policymakers can influence decisions, how the transition can be managed in a just way. John Collingridge, business editor\\nIt\u2019s hard to think of an aspect of modern life that has been untouched by the climate emergency, and the arts world is no exception.\\nIncreasingly, artists are forcing us to confront the issue head-on, meaning that our culture writers often find themselves channelling the latest climate anxieties. Almost 10 years ago, Guardian critic Michael Billington called Stephen Emmott\u2019s Ten Billion, which laid out the crisis in detail, \u201cone of the most disturbing evenings I have ever spent in a theatre\u201d. Oscar-winner Bong Joon-ho\u2019s Snowpiercer imagined a world encased in ice after humanity failed to get to grips with global heating. Wolfgang Tillmans\u2019s 2011 photograph Waste Power Station depicted a world drowning in rubbish, while Richard Powers\u2019s celebrated book The Overstory inspired a wave of cli-fi \u2013 novels inspired by the climate crisis.\\nIn terms of practical action, however, things are more scattershot. The Serpentine Gallery is currently running a project called Back to Earth, for which about 60 artists and scientists are collaborating on initiatives responding to the crisis. The Frieze art fair has switched to Green D+ biodiesel fuel for its generators. The Royal Court theatre in London banned single-use plastic bottles in a bid to go fully carbon neutral. The band Massive Attack commissioned their own report on how touring might become more sustainable. And the recent Inside Out festival in Dorset featured a group of performers inviting their audience to consider our relationship with the planet with the aid of soil-throwing dances and a giant globe suspended among the trees.\\nFor years, the production of culture involved sending people and objects flying around the world. It ate up resources voraciously; even sent journalists to far-flung countries to meet artists for short interviews. We are now acutely aware of the waste involved. The pandemic has taught journalists that interviews can be done satisfactorily on Zoom, even if there is sometimes no substitute for seeing works and people in real life. We\u2019re still figuring this conundrum out. Use local writers instead? Travel by train rather than by air? Be extremely sparing about foreign trips? All of these, plus other solutions we haven\u2019t worked out yet, deserve consideration as we change in tandem with the world we\u2019re covering. Alex Needham, culture editor\\nIf you\u2019re ordering books, searching for gig tickets or checking your friend\u2019s birthday online, then you\u2019re adding to the huge power consumption of major US tech companies. The combined power usage of Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google and Facebook is about as much as New Zealand\u2019s.\\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, since 2010 the number of internet users worldwide has doubled while global internet traffic has grown 12-fold. That\u2019s a lot of energy, a lot of carbon dioxide and a lot of plastic and metal for the accompanying computer, mobile-phone and network-infrastructure hardware. Datacentres and data transmission networks \u2013 all made ever busier by surging internet and mobile phone use \u2013 each account for about 1% of global electricity use. Mining of bitcoin alone accounts for as much as 0.3% of global electricity use.\\nThe sustainable use of resources is an important strand of our technology coverage. Our product reviews incorporate a key sustainability ranking. Our scrutiny of Big Tech includes their environmental credentials, including promises to become carbon neutral. Microsoft, Apple and Amazon have all set major environmental targets for 2030. Given their size and their central role in our lives, it\u2019s important that we keep a close eye on whether they are met. Dan Milmo, global technology editor\\nTwo years ago, we published new thinking on our editorial use of pictures to portray the climate crisis. In short, it was out with cliches like polar bears and penguins, and in with images that viscerally depict how the emergency is affecting lives around the world. We no longer wanted the symbolic and abstract, we wanted real-life manifestations of the climate crisis.\\nSince then, the proliferation of extreme weather events has generated the kind of images that really bring home the size of the challenge we face: week after week we see images of devastating floods, wildfires, droughts \u2013 and the people caught in the middle of them. This human impact, we feel, is a much more dramatic way of projecting the urgency of the crisis.\\nMy team sifts through about 30,000 new images every day. It\u2019s striking to note how a growing proportion of them reflect the climate struggle from parts of the world that are really on the frontline. Photojournalists are much more alive to these stories, and are filing them under \u201cclimate crisis\u201d rather than just under \u201cflood\u201d or \u201cstorm\u201d as they used to.\\nWhen it comes to the summitry and the politics, as it inevitably does, the drama is often to be found in the surrounding demonstrations. Protest pictures used to be rather ordinary. Now, ever since Greta Thunberg really, they have become much more visual, with lots of young people involved, inventive placards that give you a different angle. That\u2019s what we are looking for.\\nAdditionally, at something like Cop26, there will be a lot of photo exhibitions and creative projects on display, so it\u2019s a good showcase for some of the incredible work that photojournalists and artists have been doing. We\u2019ll be keen to explore this imagery and assess what new elements it brings to the genre. Fiona Shields, head of photography\\nUntil a few years ago, sustainability was a discussion which happened on the fringes of fashion. It is now a vital lens through which we consider every aspect of the industry.\\nThere is no bigger story in fashion than the environmental impact of mass-produced clothing. The days of writing only about hemlines and mood boards are over; holding the industry to account is at the core of our beat. So we look behind the scenes and find out where the fabric was sourced from, how long the supply chains are, and whether workers\u2019 rights are being protected. We interrogate where the industry is falling short on its responsibilities \u2013 and shine a light on progress where it is being made. (Trainers made from vegan mushroom leather, anyone?)\\nWe want to have a nice life, but we also want to live a good life. That is not just about fashion, but fashion is a good place to start.\\nSo when we showcase a new trend, we suggest options on how you could rent the look or buy a vintage version. The sustainability metric which we apply to everything we do follows clothes on their journey from workshop and factory, to the gloss of shows and retail, to what you (really) need in your wardrobe \u2013 and what happens to your clothes when you\u2019re bored with them. You\u2019ll find fewer articles about wardrobe clearouts, and more about mending and upcycling. Jess Cartner-Morley, fashion editor\\nGlobally, agriculture is estimated to account for approximately one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. Food emissions in the US, with its huge levels of meat and dairy consumption, are the third highest in the world behind China and Indonesia, accounting for 8.2% of global food emissions.\\nA major Guardian US series called Our Unequal Earth examines the winners and losers of the country\u2019s food system \u2013 and the climate crisis is at the centre of the series. We are looking at the ways the US food system has focused \u2013 in the words of the UN special rapporteur on the right to food \u2013 on \u201cdominating nature instead of working with nature and enhancing biodiversity\u201d.\\nA widely read story we published about networks of Indigenous women in the US and Central America reclaiming and celebrating ancient traditions gave us a glimpse of how much interest there is in food sovereignty and alternatives to industrialised food systems.\\nThose systems work very well for big corporations, like those in the US which make billions of dollars as market consolidation allows them to dictate terms to consumers. They do not work so well for small farmers, or migrant workers toiling in heatwaves or meat processing plants. And they do not work for the planet, given the true costs of industrialised agriculture, factory farms, and monocrops.\\nThat is an unpalatable truth that we will continue to report on. Mark Oliver, US news editor\\nEating feels so complicated sometimes now, doesn\u2019t it? So many tricky choices.

There are about 23,000 on the Guardian website, including plenty of ideas for meat eaters, so we rarely add new beef ones. Our cooks flag when you could use meat with a lower environmental impact or how you might veganise it.\\nThomasina Miers is The New Flexitarian, creating easy midweek dishes for people who want to cut down on meat but aren\u2019t ready to give it up completely. For those who want to go further and be fully plant-based, Meera Sodha writes a delicious weekly vegan recipe.\\nFish is tricky, as the documentary Seascape revealed. Some species are plentiful, some endangered. But it depends where and how they\u2019re caught. And it changes by season and year. We aim to publish recipes for sustainable fish \u2013 in the UK, we follow the Marine Conservation Society\u2019s Good Fish Guide, which has a traffic light system. We watch for green.\\nIf this is all making you want a glass of wine, you might think about the environmental impact of that choice too.\\nWe\u2019ve been talking about food at the Guardian for 200 years. The first edition of the paper in 1821 carried an advert for a new vegetable cookery book and we reported on the heated words and cold sago pudding at the Vegetarian Society\u2019s 1850 banquet. There\u2019s more than ever to chew on. Tim Lusher, editor, Feast\\nTen years ago, climate was a side issue for development journalists. We were of course aware that unseasonal rains and drought had knock-on effects: people living with HIV would struggle with their medication, because ARTs were not to be taken on an empty stomach; girls would be pulled out of school to look after siblings while their mothers took longer journeys to collect water. But the links to climate were more often than not opaque.\\nBut now, it\u2019s rare to have a global development story that isn\u2019t heavily coloured by the climate emergency in some way \u2013 from women\u2019s rights to conflict.\\nSo when we cover family planning issues in Uganda, there is a climate dimension: having fewer, healthier children will put less pressure on farmland and biodiversity. When we cover migration in Bangladesh, for example, it often stems directly from an unpredictable climate that makes land harder to work.\\nEven natural disasters like the swarms of locusts across parts of Africa, Asia and the Middle East, have a climate angle. Unseasonal rains created the moist conditions that desert locusts need to breed.\\nFortunately, as the crisis deepens, we are also seeing more people trying to find solutions \u2013 from Palestinian entrepreneur Majd Mashharawi creating affordable, off-grid solar kits for families in Gaza, to Paul Matovu finding space-saving ways to farm in Uganda, and Nnaemeka Ikegwuonu creating mobile, solar-powered storage facilities to store food and prevent waste in Nigeria.

How much water is used to tend to grass pitches? Is it ethical for teams to fly round the world to play games? What about sponsorship by petrochemical companies as a way of sportswashing their reputations?\\nAthletes are starting to find their voices. Big names such as Olympian Katherine Grainger, Wallabies captain David Pocock, Australian cricketers Rachael Haynes and Pat Cummins, H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn of Arsenal, and Olympic gold-winning canoeist Etienne Stott (who has been visible at Extinction Rebellion protests) are working to make sport more sustainable and trying to inspire their fans. Our sports journalists are increasingly aware of this as they cover the story off the pitch as well as the one on it.\\nResearch shows that sports stars now have the most influential voices on the planet \u2013 just look at what Marcus Rashford has been able to achieve. Sport doesn\u2019t have a grand seat in the room at Cop26, but as a means of communicating the severity of the climate crisis and inspiring generations, it has a reach politicians can only dream of. Tanya Aldred, sports writer\\nFew parts of the economy are immune to the climate crisis. In the US, for example, the crisis looms over the threat to coastal properties from rising sea levels, droughts in agriculture, extreme heat\u2019s impact on farming and construction work, and climate-related supply-chain disruptions from domestic and international suppliers.\\nThe US remains the world\u2019s most powerful and innovative economy and is likely to set the pace of change for the rest of the world. But many of the US\u2019s most powerful corporations are lobbying to see off regulation that would force or speed up change in favour of \u201cmarket-based solutions\u201d, and in Washington political tensions can quickly undo the best-laid plans of even the most staunch supporters of change.\\nWith its global perspective and focus on minorities and other underserved groups, the Guardian is ideally positioned to expose greenwashing, champion those communities most affected by climate change and hold business, and its overseers, accountable in what will be the defining struggle of our age.

Fifty years after my first arrest, I\u2019ve embraced being locked up in the name of the planet. As Cop26 nears, here\u2019s why it\u2019s time to rise up\\nThe good fight: the climate activists risking everything\\nThe first time I was ever arrested, I was picked up for smuggling drugs into the US from Canada. They were vitamin pills, but that didn\u2019t seem to matter to the police officer in Cleveland, who mentioned that his orders had come from the Nixon White House. It was 1970. I had just started a campus speaking tour protesting against the Vietnam war, and was under surveillance by the National Security Agency. I raised my fist for the mugshot, and after a night in jail, they let me go.\\nI think the idea was to discredit my opposition to the war, and maybe get my speeches cancelled. Instead, students turned up in their thousands. My first arrest wasn\u2019t for an act of civil disobedience, exactly, but the lesson I took away from that surreal experience was just how powerful it can be to set your ideals against the machinery of the state. Half a century later, it still works. And, as the extraordinary activists who tell their stories here attest, it remains an indispensable means of being heard by those who would prefer to ignore us.\\nToday, the climate crisis requires collective action on a scale that humanity has never accomplished, and in the face of those odds a sense of hopelessness may occasionally descend. But the antidote to that feeling is to do something. The question is: what? Changing individual lifestyle choices like giving up meat and getting rid of single-use plastic won\u2019t cut it when time is not on our side. We need to go further, faster. Instead of changing straws and lightbulbs, we need to focus on changing policy and politicians. We need large numbers of people working together for solutions that work for the climate. Nonviolent civil disobedience can help to mobilise that movement. At 83, I\u2019m still ready to get arrested when the occasion demands it.\\nIn 2019, for example, I was arrested four times. I had been inspired by the global rising of Extinction Rebellion, the Sunrise Movement, and Greta Thunberg. Young people like Greta were calling on older generations to step up, and, well, I\u2019m definitely older. It made sense to me: why should the burden of fixing this problem be on those who didn\u2019t create it? In the same year, almost 400 scientists from more than 20 countries called for civil disobedience, arguing that \u201cthe continued governmental inaction over the climate and ecological crisis now justifies peaceful, nonviolent protest and direct action, even if this goes beyond the bounds of the current law\u201d. I thought: maybe if I could get arrested in my 80s, it would get noticed. People might say: if she can do it, so can I.\\nWith the help of Greenpeace, I launched Fire Drill Fridays. For four months we held weekly rallies in Washington DC followed by acts of civil disobedience including standing on the Capitol steps with banners, chanting, and blocking roads. We started small: about 16 of us walked up the steps of the Capitol, and turned to face the crowd of supporters and media that had followed us. There was something routine, almost ritualistic, about it: a line of 10 police officers had parted to let us take up our position. Then, as we had been told they would, they gave us the first of three warnings that we had to leave or face arrest.\\nWe kept chanting and waving our signs. After the third warning, they stepped towards those of us who had stood our ground, and began to secure our hands behind our backs with white plastic cuffs. They stayed silent, almost stoic, as they led us to the vans. But we felt energised. I wasn\u2019t scared: this was what I wanted to do, to put my body on the line, align myself fully with my values. There is something powerful about not knowing what\u2019s about to happen, knowing that for a period of time you will have no control, and then to go ahead, and do it anyway.\\nI don\u2019t mean to cast myself as a hero: the simple calculation is that my age and celebrity secures the kind of national and global press attention that the cause needs. That\u2019s why I invited friends like Catherine Keener and Rosanna Arquette to join me. Another time, I shouted my acceptance speech for a Bafta while they led me away in cuffs. My publicist had hoped I\u2019d come back to Los Angeles for it, but I\u2019m told they liked the video in the auditorium.\\nEvery Friday, people travelled to join us from all over the country. Most had never risked arrest before, and many told me they found the experience transformative. But as a famous white woman, I am under no illusions that my experience had much in common with that of a Black person without the international press in tow. We have to grapple with that dreadful reality if we want to be sure that what we\u2019re doing is something more than tourism.\\nAfter a certain number of prior arrests, the police take a firmer line, and so, after my fourth, I wound up spending the night in jail. They shackled my hands and feet, and led me to a cell of my own: just me and the cockroaches. I got a baloney and cheese sandwich on white bread (I happen to like baloney). They stationed an officer outside \u201cfor my protection\u201d, which freaked me out a little bit: given the lock, who could they be protecting me from but themselves? I used my sweater and scarf as a pillow, and put my coat over me, and tried to get some rest. When the officers were clanking up and down, making an awful lot of noise, I summoned all my upper-class-lady powers to ask if they could please be quiet so I could go to sleep. It didn\u2019t make any difference.\\nThe next day was an object lesson in how differently the state treats you depending on your race and position in the world: before I left, I was held with a number of other women, most of them Black, many seeming as if they needed proper care, not incarceration. I walked out, but they did not.\\nI hope that my disobedience can be a small contribution to the fight to press our governments to make immediate, bold policy changes that end all new fossil fuel development, ensure a just transition for affected workers and communities, and invest in the green energy systems to replace them. Hundreds of millions of lives hang in the balance with every half degree of warming we either enable or avoid, and right now world leaders are going in the opposite direction.\\nThere is plenty of evidence that nonviolent civil disobedience can change the course of history. Think of the Boston Tea Party, Gandhi\u2019s salt march and its role in securing India\u2019s freedom from British colonialism, and the Montgomery bus boycott. Climate activists have spent years petitioning, writing articles and books, exposing officials to evidence, generating hundreds of thousands of texts and letters to officials, marched, lobbied: all to no avail.\\nThis is what justifies nonviolent civil disobedience today \u2013 and it must be nonviolent if it is to secure public support. Research by the Yale Project on Climate Communication has found that 11% of Americans are alarmed by the climate crisis, but haven\u2019t campaigned because nobody has asked them to. Around 10% of Americans aged over 18 are ready to engage in nonviolent disobedience, but have never been asked to do that, either. Well, it\u2019s time to ask. Fire Drill Fridays started with a handful of arrests, and ended with hundreds: since then, we have continued to reach out with virtual Fire Drills during the pandemic. We had 9 million viewers across all digital platforms in 2020; viewers we are educating about climate and inviting to action. It is the \u201cGreat Unasked\u201d that must be mobilised now worldwide.\\nWe have all seen documentaries of activists willing to break unjust laws, face hoses and police batons, and asked ourselves what we would do if put to the test. Now\u2019s our time. This is our moment. We don\u2019t all necessarily need to face the hoses or get arrested, but unprecedented numbers of us need to rise up and put relentless pressure on the leaders who will attend next month\u2019s Cop26 summit in Glasgow. We are the last generation that still has a chance to force a course change that can save lives and species on a vast scale. Remember: the cure for despair is action. And if you can put yourself on the line, who knows who you might inspire?", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34818d88a3844ce13f511dec54355a3751187a83/0_1588_5504_3302/master/5504.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Jane Fonda raising her fist"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99a192617bdcdc6c6517506fb7eb822ae2205aca/16_132_1804_1082/master/1804.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "\u2018I raised my fist for the mugshot\u2019.

He received 21% of first-choice votes.\\nThe election was loosely billed as a choice between two approaches to the party\u2019s future.

Ahead of the crucial Cop26 conference, we talk to young activists around the world. Introduction by author Olivia Laing\\nWhen I was 20, I dropped out of university to live on a road protest. I was terrified by the oncoming apocalypse of climate change, and loathed the short-term, environmentally catastrophic logic that prioritised road-building over trees. The data, even in 1997, was clear: human activity was heating the globe, with increasingly devastating effects. Time was short, and a sea change in behaviour was required.\\nNearly a quarter of a century has passed since then, and very little has been achieved, thanks in large part to corporate interests invested in maintaining our dependence on non-renewable resources. Far more people understand and accept the reality of anthropogenic climate change, and yet we seem paralysed by despair, caught in a spell of inertia, even as the most lurid of predictions \u2013 floods, fires, plagues \u2013 come to pass.\\nI say we, but the generation born into the reality of global heating are refusing to accept this lethal status quo. The testimonies of these teens and early twenty-somethings are humbling and often thrilling. By setting up a student bank based on recycling waste, Jos\u00e9 Adolfo Quisocala single-handedly changed child poverty and environmental pollution in his town in Peru. Though their projects vary widely, these young activists have a strikingly shared sense of what must be changed, from education and the foregrounding of indigenous voices to making people appreciate the value of nature.\\nAs Hilda Flavia Nakabuye, an activist from Uganda, says: \u201cWe are a generation of scared people. But we are very persistent. And very united.\u201d This is the kind of vision and ambition necessary from the delegates at COP26. The stakes could not be higher. If only our leaders had the courage of these kids. Olivia Laing\\nIt was in November 2013 that the urgency of the climate crisis became clear to Marinel Ubaldo. A typhoon had been forecast in the Philippines and it was due to hit the peaceful village in Eastern Visayas where she lived with her family. Initially, she wasn\u2019t especially worried. \u201cWe had been living with typhoons all our lives \u2013 it was not new to us,\u201d she remembers. Her father, a fisherman, told her to go to a nearby shelter that was on higher ground. It was the right decision: Haiyan hit the Philippines with winds up to 195mph, one of the world\u2019s strongest ever typhoons.\\nBuildings that Ubaldo had thought were strong were ripped apart in seconds. More than 7,360 people were killed or went missing and at least 4 million were displaced. The disaster dramatically altered the way Ubaldo saw the planet. \u201cIt gave me a new perspective on what the future could be,\u201d she says.\\nTwo years later, Ubaldo won a scholarship to study social work in Tacloban, a city devastated by the typhoon, working alongside studying so that she could help her family, who had lost everything as a result of the typhoon. Increasingly, she devoted her time to fighting the climate crisis.\\nUbaldo has since protested at Shell\u2019s Manila headquarters, in front of the Wall Street Bull in New York, and helped organise the first climate youth strike in Eastern Visayas. Her proudest moment, she says, was testifying as a community witness to the Philippines Commission on Human Rights as part of their investigation into corporate responsibility for climate change. In 2019, the commission found that 47 major oil, coal, cement and mining companies could be held liable for the impact of their operations on Filipino citizens. The landmark ruling illustrated \u201cthe power of people\u201d, says Ubaldo. \u201cEven if you are poor, or just only one, or from a remote community, you have power. You can always call out corporations and leaders who are fuelling climate change.\u201d\\nUbaldo, who now works full time on climate issues, focuses on supporting grassroots initiatives. She co-founded the group Youth Leaders for Environmental Action Federation, is a climate justice youth adviser for Greenpeace Philippines and also works with Living Laudato Si\u2019 Philippines, an interfaith movement that advocates for the divestment of coal.\\nHer work is high risk. According to Global Witness, 29 activists were killed last year in the Philippines. It is common for activists to receive threats or be subject to \u201cred tagging\u201d \u2013 labelled by the state as communists or terrorists. Last year, four activists and a journalist from Tacloban were arrested for possession of firearms following an illegal raid. It has been claimed that security forces had falsified evidence and Amnesty International has called for an investigation. At the time of the raid, Ubaldo received a message suggesting she too would be arrested and moved to stay with a friend as a precaution.\\n\u201cThe thing is,\u201d she says, \u201cthey don\u2019t just come for you, they come for your family, for your friends\u2026 That worries me more than my own safety.\u201d But the threats, she says, are at least a sign that those in power are hearing your voice.\u201cThis is very personal for me. If I do not continue fighting I will feel that I am betraying the people who perished because of climatic disasters. Because they are not just numbers, they are not just climate statistics.\u201d\\nWho is your climate villain? \u201cThe corporations, all of them. They are profiting from our suffering.\u201d\\nLab beef or grass fed? \u201cI don\u2019t eat meat but I have to remain pescatarian or my father [a fisherman] would be really angry. When I go home I love to eat paksiw fish, which is cooked in soy sauce, vinegar and a little oil with onion and garlic. Everything is just fresh, even the herbs that you put on your food \u2013 you can just get them outside of your house.\u201d\\nIf you had the power to make one change to combat the climate crisis, large or small, what would it be? \u201cI would go to the community and ask them what they want and support their own grassroots climate actions. And I would let the fossil fuels stay in the ground.\u201d Rebecca Ratcliffe\\nNot many 17-year-olds have ground-breaking judicial decisions named after them, but as lead litigant in Sharma and others v Minister for the Environment, Anjali Sharma achieved that world first when Judge Bromberg ruled in May this year that the minister did have a duty of care not to harm children.\\nSharma became involved in School Strike 4 Climate in 2019 after hearing about the impact climate change had on relatives who are farmers in India. \u201cThis stuff drives people to anxiety, it drives people to tears because it\u2019s just so real for us right now,\u201d she says.\\nHer hope with the legal case was to stop the extension of a coal mine in New South Wales. But last month, the expansion was approved. Sharma found out by text message between school exams. \u201cWe went to court in a completely novel legal battle and we won, and yet [Australian environment minister] Sussan Ley approved the mine. Sometimes it feels like nothing is happening,\u201d she says.\\nPlenty is happening for Sharma. First, the Australian government is appealing against the duty of care ruling later this month, then she has exams. She\u2019s also focused on her twin passions of music and netball. \u201cAt school everyone knows me as \u2018that kid\u2019. It\u2019s completely different when I go to netball where I can be a normal teenage girl \u2013 because that\u2019s what I am.\u201d\\nIf you could make one change\u2026 \u201cI\u2019d cut all Australian government ties with mining companies such as Origin and Santos, which have constantly procured grants for new fossil fuel exploration projects and influenced Australia\u2019s climate policy due to their Australian political connections. Instead I\u2019d have our climate policy influenced by our First Nations people and those on the frontlines. These are the people who have a true connection and love for the land.\u201d Meg Keneally\\nFor years, twice a day Aadya Joshi walked past a scrapyard in her neighbourhood of south Mumbai on her way to and from school. Originally meant to be the garden of the local police station, it had become an overgrown, toxic eyesore with a decade\u2019s waste festering in the heat. When she was 15, in her summer holidays, Joshi decided to do something about it.\\n\u201cI walked in to the police station and was like, \u2018Can I please clean your garden?\u2019\u201d recalls Joshi. \u201cIt took three or four weeks of me just being like, \u2018Please, please, please, please, please,\u2019 and coming back every day, rain or shine. I had to convince them that I was not going to flake halfway and leave them with more work.\u201d\\nThe plot of land is long and thin: about the dimensions of a cricket wicket. But, over the course of four Sundays in the summer, with help from local residents, Joshi did more than clear it. She replanted it with native Indian plants and trees. It was gruelling but rewarding work: \u201cWhen I say toxic I really mean it,\u201d says Joshi. \u201cThe first day that we cleaned up I made the mistake of not wearing gloves and I was sick for two weeks.\u201d\\nThe idea for native planting came from Joshi\u2019s reading on the Miyawaki method of afforestation and the work of University of Delaware ecologist Douglas Tallamy. These both argue that planting the right trees can have a significant impact on restoring insect and animal biodiversity. The results in Mumbai were pretty well instantaneous: monkeys now hang out at the police station, and butterflies and birds have made the garden their home.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely difficult being a kid telling adults what to do,\u201d says Joshi. \u201cNot everyone is always receptive, but I think there\u2019s a benefit with having actual science to back up what you\u2019re saying.\u201d\\nAfter creating the garden, Joshi developed a database of 2,000 plants indigenous to the Indian subcontinent and last year was awarded the annual Children\u2019s Climate prize, founded by Swedish energy company Telge Energi. She also began planning larger projects, but these were curtailed first by Covid, and now because she has just started as an undergraduate on the Earth Systems Program at Stanford University. Her advice for others looking to follow in her footsteps is to start small. \u201cIf you bite off more than you can chew in the beginning, you stagnate and you lose motivation,\u201d she says. \u201cBut something small, like your neighbourhood police station, it\u2019s very manageable.\u201d\\nWho is your climate hero? \u201cDr Douglas Tallamy. His book Bringing Nature Home is all about how native plants preserve biodiversity. The whole point was to take that research and put it into a local context for India.\u201d\\nHow do you relax? \u201cA good book. Recently Indica: A Deep Natural History of the Indian Subcontinent by Pranay Lal and In the Kingdom of Ice by Hampton Sides. It\u2019s very depressing, but it\u2019s very good.\u201d\\nIf you could make one change\u2026 \u201cIt would be to plant native everywhere.\u201d Tim Lewis\\n\u201cYour beds may be comfortable for now but not for long,\u201d Hilda Flavia Nakabuye told the 2019 World Mayors Summit in Copenhagen. \u201cYou will soon feel the same heat we feel every day.\u201d As a child, Nakabuye watched heavy rains, strong winds and drought gradually devastate her grandparents\u2019 farm. Cassava, matoke and potato gardens withered; livestock died and eventually her family was forced to sell off the land.\\nAt Kampala University, she made the connection that their suffering was a direct result of global heating and in 2019 she founded Uganda\u2019s Fridays for Future campaign, which now has 53,000 youth members. Nakabuye is fiercely critical of the unequal representation of countries from the global south in terms of decision-making . She is campaigning for equal participation for the Most Affected People and Areas (Mapa) at Cop26, where she says it is vital to drum into world leaders that \u201cglobal emissions are [currently] expected to rise by 16% by 2030 yet we need to drop them by 50% by 2030.\u201d\\n\u201cWe are a generation of scared people,\u201d she says, \u201cbut we are very persistent. And very united.\u201d\\nIf you could make one change\u2026 \u201cHaha, that sounds like a lot of power! Within one hour I would shut down all fossil fuel industries.\u201d Sarah Donaldson\\nYusuf Baluch became an activist last year in the wake of a massive forest fire near his home town of Gwadar, southwest Pakistan, though he says the climate crisis has shadowed his life since childhood. Now he spends much of his time organising for Fridays for Future and engaging in school strikes, despite the threat of arrest from Pakistan\u2019s military. \u201cGiving up is not an option,\u201d he says. \u201cI have to fight on.\u201d\\nIf you could make one change\u2026 \u201cThere should be climate clubs and centres everywhere, at a local level, so people can get educated \u2013 so we can fight this together.\u201d Killian Fox\\nVic Barrett does not speak Polish. The tattoo artist he met did not have much English. But, during some downtime at the 2018 United Nations climate change conference in Katowice, Barrett presented his arm to him along with a rough sketch of a geometric design featuring the number \u201c370\u201d, the \u201cgreater than\u201d sign and two diamonds. \u201cWe still had a pretty good time,\u201d says the 22-year-old Barrett now, laughing. \u201cAnd it was a special trip and it just felt right to somehow commemorate it.\u201d\\nThe 370 in the tattoo refers to a measurement in parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: this was the level it was at when Barrett was born in 1999. It\u2019s now more than 400ppm, which most scientists agree is a hazardous indicator of human-made climate change. Barrett turns serious: \u201cThe tattoo is a reminder to myself and to others that there are generations of young people who have been born into a world that we know scientifically is incapable of sustaining them,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s highlighting this unique experience of being a young person on the planet right now.\u201d\\nBarrett\u2019s awakening to the climate emergency came in 2012, when Hurricane Sandy tore up the east coast of North America. He was living in New York and while the damage was widespread \u2013 around 650,000 homes were destroyed; 8.5 million people were stranded without power \u2013 he noticed that the devastation was especially severe for low and middle-income people, whose homes were more likely to be built in flood-prone areas and who were less likely to have insurance. Aged 14, Barrett, who has black and indigenous Honduran heritage, began working with the nonprofit Global Kids and dived deep into \u201cenvironmental racism\u201d.\\nIn 2015, Barrett was one of a group of 21 young people who sued the US government for violating their fifth and ninth amendment rights by encouraging the use of fossil fuels since the 1960s. Juliana v United States has now been in the courts for a quarter of Barrett\u2019s life and the case continues to rumble on. Much of the past six years has clearly been thrilling: speaking at the UN, hanging out with Greta Thunberg, becoming a powerful voice of youth activism. But Barrett hopes that the next generation will not have to follow his path.\\n\u201cI don\u2019t really want my kids to have to sue the US federal government or to have to be environmental activists in school, to speak at the UN,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sure that would be awesome for them, but I don\u2019t want them to have to fight the way we did.\u201d\\nWho is your climate hero? \u201cBerta C\u00e1ceres. She\u2019s a Honduran water protector, who ended up being killed for fighting against a dam that was going to harm the indigenous people of her community.\u201d\\nAnd your climate villain? \u201cHypocritical politicians. In the US now we have an administration that claims to have more progressive values, but, for example, there are still pipelines being built through indigenous-treaty territories.\u201d\\nIf you had the power to make one change to help solve the climate crisis what would it be? \u201cI want to see a better version of the United Nations framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) process. Right now it\u2019s all hired negotiators from different countries and their whole job is to negotiate. I would like to see more indigenous leaders included, more black leaders included, more leaders from the global south included.\u201d\\nHow do you relax? \u201cI like to go kayaking, hang out with my friends, go out to the bar sometimes, play video games. Regular kiddo stuff.\u201d TL\\nWhen he was seven, Jos\u00e9 Adolfo Quisocala created a bank for school friends in his home town of Arequipa, Peru, to save money to buy books, stationery and uniforms. Now, nine years later, the Bartselana Student Bank has 6,700 clients, all aged under 18. As well as saving, children can earn money by bringing plastic and paper to recycle at school drop-offs \u2013 the money is automatically credited to their bank accounts. Every month, the bank recycles between 15 and 16 tonnes of paper and plastic through local companies.\\nThe idea came to Quisocala when he saw children begging at traffic lights and wondered how he could help them and their families earn and save, as well as recycle household rubbish that would otherwise become litter or go into landfill. He missed out on school to pursue his idea, but it was worth it, he says. \u201cIn my town, I was able to considerably reduce the level of child poverty, the school drop-out rate and environmental pollution.\u201d\\nQuisocala also helped create the Bartselana Foundation, which converts donations of recyclable waste from local companies into funds to combat child hunger and improve education. Since the onset of the pandemic, the foundation has been making free online educational videos \u2013 explaining, for example, how to distinguish different types of plastics and paper for recycling \u2013 which it puts out via social media. \u201cThis is such important and relevant information that is not taught in school, that we had to make it public and free to watch,\u201d says Quisocala.\\nNow 16, he plans to hand over the running of the bank to a new (also young) CEO in order to go to university. He intends to continue his social activism, working with the \u201cleast-favoured or forgotten groups in Latin America\u201d and helping them profit by carrying out environmental services.\\nIf you could make one change\u2026 \u201cI would teach children, the young, adults and senior citizens what awaits us in the future if we continue living the way we are now. The climate plays a role in every aspect of our lives; our money, our health, agriculture, our flora and fauna. With education, people can take small steps to improve the relationship between humans and nature.\u201d Dan Collyns\\nIt was a school lesson on Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King that made sisters Melati and Isabel Wijsen think about how they could change the world and in 2013, aged 10 and 12, they launched Bye Bye Plastic Bags, an initiative to stop single-use bags which is now active in 30 countries. \u201cIt organically started to grow,\u201d explains Melati, now 20. \u201cYoung people could see a real-life example of what was possible.\u201d\\nThe girls\u2019 campaign was exemplary. They started making educational booklets to explain the dangers of marine pollution and set up a pilot scheme for a plastic-free village. Next came a how-to video on making a river barrier from recycled material to prevent rubbish reaching the sea and a social enterprise scheme employing local women to make reusable bags. In 2018 they resorted to hunger strike when the governor of Bali wouldn\u2019t meet and discuss government policy. He caved in two days later and by 2019, single-use plastic bags were banned from the island.\\nNow the Wijsens have launched an online learning platform called Youthopia. \u201cIt has masterclasses, workshops and mentorship. We want it to become the world\u2019s HQ for young change-makers.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine they won\u2019t make it happen.\\nIf you could make one change\u2026 \u201cI would adapt the education system to teach about these problems and create spaces for innovation. Young people are not given the tools or the guidance to think big and create new systems.\u201d Alice Fisher\\nScarlett Westbrook is a 17-year-old with an open expression, friendly smile and plaits like bell-pulls. It would be natural to assume \u2013 had you never heard her speak \u2013 that she was an ordinary schoolgirl and not the formidable climate justice activist she is. But by the age of 10, Scarlett was already going on marches and canvassing for local elections (at the time, she was \u201creally into\u201d Ed Miliband\u2019s climate policies). She has grown up in inner-city Birmingham and her encouraging parents \u2013 not in any political party themselves \u2013 would tag along with her as she knocked on doors. It must have been clear then that Scarlett was not born to be one of life\u2019s passengers.\\nAt 13, she distinguished herself by passing an A-level in government and politics \u2013 the youngest person ever to do so. She taught herself in seven months. Her speciality was climate and education which was what, in part, led to her later work as a member of the UK Student Climate Network (UKSCN). Neither her parents nor her teachers believed Scarlett when she told them she intended to sit the A-level, so Westbrook emailed the exam board\u2026 \u201cI kept arguing until I got my way!\u201d (A useful talent in an activist.)\\nWestbrook has been one of the leading organisers of the school strikes in Birmingham and is the youngest known \u201cregular policy writer\u201d in parliamentary history. She won the Women of the Future Young Star award in 2020 and the Diana award this year, for humanitarian work. Scarlett is invariably modest about her achievements \u2013 not wishing to distract from what matters most to her. She now heads up Teach the Future, the impressive student-led campaign founded by her friend Joe Brindle, which aims to transform the British education system by putting the climate at its centre. It is responsible for \u201cthe first ever student bill, the English Climate Emergency Education Act\u201d and for holding a parliamentary reception, organised and led by Westbrook, for more than 100 MPs and Lords. (It has secured cross-party support from everyone except the DUP.) She argues that climate should be \u201cwoven like a golden thread into every single subject\u201d. And her own thinking proves impressively joined up: she talks eloquently about climate crisis in relation to capitalism, colonialism, gender inequality and pandemics.\\nTeach the Future\u2019s research shows that \u201conly 4% of students feel they know a great deal about [the climate emergency]\u201d. But the percentage of students who are concerned is much higher (with six in 10 said to be \u201cextremely worried\u201d ). Scarlett believes climate action and strong community support are the way forward, adding: \u201cOur government could choose to act on the climate but is actively choosing not to\u2026\u201d\\nWhile she believes in the importance of individual action, she is keen to emphasise the shocking figures that reveal collective responsibility: \u201cA hundred companies are responsible for 71% of [global] emissions,\u201d she says, while \u201cthe entire continent of Africa is responsible for only 2-3% of emissions.\u201d She points out that 70% of flights are taken by 15% of people. Listening to her, I find myself daydreaming that she could make, one day, the most amazing prime minister. But when I ask if she is planning to become a politician, she flinches. \u201cAbsolutely not. I specifically want to go into medicine. I want to be a humanitarian trauma surgeon working in natural disasters or war to help people out. With the climate crisis, that is going to be an increasingly important job.\u201d\\nHow do you relax? \u201cIt often feels like the weight of the future is on our shoulders so it is really important to wind down and spend time with people you care about to maintain your capacity to act, and your wellbeing.\u201d\\nSolar or nuclear? \u201cSolar!\u201d\\nIf you could make one change\u2026 \u201cI would implement an international Green New Deal, which would aim not only to decarbonise the economy through a 10-year, government-led mobilisation but also to create jobs and to bridge the inequality divide through investment in the areas that need it most.\u201d Kate Kellaway\\n\u201cMy two loves are exploring and inventing,\u201d says 20-year-old Fionn Ferreira, who won the top global award at the 2019 Google Science Fair for his work on reducing plastic pollution in water. It was while kayaking around the coast of West Cork, where he grew up, that Ferreira became keenly aware of the problem \u2013 not just large plastics bobbing on the waves but microplastics pervading the water around him.\\nAged 15, he designed his own spectrometer to measure the amount of microplastics in local water \u2013 the readings were so high that at first he thought the machine was broken. Then he set about finding a way to remove them. \u201cI thought, what\u2019s plastic made of? It\u2019s made of crude oil. And why does crude oil float on top of water? Because the polarity is different.\u201d By adding magnetite to oil, he discovered that he could attract the microplastics in a sample of water and remove the vast majority of them with a magnet.\\nNow the chemistry undergrad has created his own startup, Fionn & Co, and has received funding from Robert Downey Jr\u2019s Footprint Coalition to build a prototype device that can filter more than 90% of microplastics from tap water. He hopes to expand the technology to work in wastewater treatment plants and even at the mouths of rivers, while letting his inventive mind fly in other directions too.\\nWinning awards and backing at such a young age has given Ferreira a sense that youth should not be a barrier to effecting real change. \u201cI feel like we need more people involved in innovation and invention at a small level, because every idea has the power to make a difference,\u201d he says.\\nIf you could make one change\u2026 \u201cWe need to get everybody to fall in love with the environment and be really, really angry about what\u2019s happening to it. Because only with everybody on board, doing their bit, can we create change.\u201d KF\\nMya-Rose Craig was nine days old when she first went birdwatching near her home in Bristol. \u201cMy parents and my older sister were massive birdwatchers. I can\u2019t remember a time when I didn\u2019t love birds,\u201d she says. She has been blogging about birds as Birdgirl since she was 11 and posting on Twitter as @BirdgirlUK since the age of 12. \u201cThat was when I started becoming passionate about environmental issues, especially climate change,\u201d she says.\\nIt was also around this time she started noticing something about outdoor spaces. \u201cMy mum is Bangladeshi and my sister and I are half Bangladeshi and I became aware that I never saw anyone who looked like us out in the countryside. As I looked into it, I realised this wasn\u2019t a superficial thing, it was systemic exclusion linked to the racial make-up of conservation bodies and the costs of getting into nature, among other things. Conversations with my cousins made me aware that birding and being in the outdoors are seen by non-white people as really white hobbies.\u201d\\nCraig set up Black2Nature, a non-profit organisation that campaigns for equal access to nature for all, runs nature camps and activities for people traditionally excluded from the countryside and campaigns to make the nature conservation and environmental sectors ethnically diverse. Her activism has won her a platform on television (Springwatch, Countryfile) and radio (Start the Week) and a doctorate in science from the University of Bristol.\\nNow 19 and studying at Cambridge University, Craig has just published We Have a Dream (Magic Cat), a book of interviews with 30 young environmental activists of colour \u2013 \u201cpeople who weren\u2019t getting the platform from the media that they deserve\u201d.\\nIf you could make one change\u2026. \u201cI\u2019d get genuine action from our leaders, right now.\u201d Lisa O\u2019Kelly\\nDubbed \u201cFrance\u2019s Greta Thunberg\u201d by the French media, Iris Duquesne was 16 when she joined 15 other teenage climate activists, including Thunberg, in late 2019 to bring a landmark legal complaint to the United Nations against France, Brazil, Germany, Turkey and Argentina. Their charge \u2013 that these countries were violating their rights as children by not taking sufficient measures against climate change \u2013 resonated around the globe.\\nLast week the UN declared it was unable to rule on the case, saying the young people must first bring lawsuits in each of the five state\u2019s national courts, despite tomes of case law showing that no such procedures would succeed. Speaking through her legal team at the non-profit Earthjustice, Duquesne said: \u201cWe are all very disappointed but unfortunately not surprised. We have seen governments and officials ignore the climate crisis over and over again and today was no exception. The fight for climate justice is not over, and we will keep pushing with or without the Committee\u2019s help.\u201d\\nIf you could make one change\u2026. \u201cI\u2019d use education worldwide to instil a real sense of climate responsibility in the next generation.\u201d LO\u2019K\\nJakob Blasel\u2019s blond curls have been a regular sight at Fridays for Future protests in Germany since the then 18-year-old organised the country\u2019s first climate strike, outside the regional parliament in Kiel in December 2018. He proved a canny organiser and passionate motivator, rallying students through WhatsApp chat groups or by spraying messages on the pavement outside their schools.\\n\u201cFrom day one it was very important to me that Fridays for Future wasn\u2019t just made up of kids who already cared about environmental issues,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was about starting a movement that spoke to an entire generation.\u201d\\nThree years later, Blasel is knocking on the doors of the Bundestag in Berlin: as a Green party candidate in his home constituency in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany\u2019s northernmost state, he gained 23,831 votes at September\u2019s federal elections, only narrowly missing out on a parliamentary seat via the party\u2019s list.\\nThe eldest of three brothers, Blasel says he was vaguely aware of climate change as a child. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t until I was 15-16 that the climate crisis became something that caused me distress.\u201d\\nIn 2017 he watched a Norwegian documentary about the global textile industry. \u201cHow could it be, I asked myself, that my teenage peers and I were wearing clothes that were produced under inhumane conditions in the global south? From that, I moved on to thinking about how clothes could be produced in a way that was not just socially fairer, but also more environmentally sustainable.\u201d\\nThe teenager started wearing more secondhand clothes, and he convinced his parents to switch to get their electricity from renewable providers. \u201cBut there was a point where that approach reached a limit: even if I change my behaviour as a consumer, we\u2019re still headed for an ecological and societal crisis. If I really cared about making a difference, I realised, I needed to take a political approach.\u201d\\nIn his campaign and on social media, Blasel describes himself as an \u201c1.5C ultra\u201d, claiming a term usually employed by fanatical football supporters. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s a little bit of a joke,\u201d he says, \u201cbut in terms of real politics, it means I am convinced that every possible effort needs to be made to limit global warming to 1.5C.\\n\u201cNow I see a lot of politicians realising that we need to have more ambitious climate targets. But they are still telling fairytales about how we will get there: that technology will magically solve climate change, that we just need to leave it up to the markets. We already have these technologies, we just need to use them. And at the moment that\u2019s not happening to the right extent.\u201d\\nBlasel says his run for the Bundestag has made him understand better why the political debate on the climate crisis has got stuck, and how it could be made to start moving again. \u201cBeing an activist means constantly pushing your own interest to the foreground, while the art of being a politician lies in reconciling different interests.\u201d\\nThe German Green party could hold a key role in the next government, as one of three coalition partners in a liberal-left power-sharing deal. Blasel says he\u2019s planning to slip back into his old activist roles to remind his party of its promises while coalition talks are ongoing. \u201cI will keep on giving my best to fight the climate crisis. Whether I do that from parliament or as an activist is almost irrelevant.\u201d\\nWho is your climate hero? \u201cStefan Rahmstorf, the German climatologist who was one of the earliest scientists to lay bare the dramatic extent of the climate crisis.\u201d\\nSolar or nuclear? \u201cSolar. People don\u2019t feel safe around nuclear power plants. I don\u2019t think most people who are still evangelising about nuclear power have thought their position through.\u201d\\nIf you had the power to make one change to help solve the climate crisis what would it be? \u201cThe switch to renewable energy has to be the basis for every step we take to address the crisis.\u201d Philip Oltermann\\nDisha Ravi experienced climate change growing up in rural India long before she knew what it was. \u201cMy grandparents are farmers and faced water shortages; my mother had to carry water from the common well before she left for school and none of us realised that this was the result of the climate crisis. Only when I was 18 did I understand it \u2013 and the inaction from our leaders.\u201d\\nRavi co-founded the Indian branch of Fridays for Future (FFF) in 2019 and spent two years organising workshops, local clean-ups and tree planting. She is also the family breadwinner, with her job at a vegan food company in Bengaluru, where she lives with her mother.\\nOne campaign close to her heart was the 2020\u20132021 Indian farmers protest when a set of farm bills that seemed to favour corporations over farmers sparked huge outcry in India, especially over minimum prices for produce. When Greta Thunberg tweeted about the campaign in February, it was Ravi who made international headlines. She was arrested for sedition and criminal conspiracy and taken to Delhi where she was held for 10 days. Police said a social media toolkit Ravi had edited for the campaign had caused disaffection and disinformation.\\nRavi is unable to discuss her ongoing legal case but her campaigning spirit is undiminished. \u201cI have seen my own house fill with water in a landlocked city, trees cut to grow the GDP, and poison released in rivers as businesses push off responsibility. I refuse to let this continue for others.\u201d\\nIf you could make one change\u2026 \u201cPeople in India face the climate crisis on a daily basis, but access to the latest science around the environment is still limited to elite private schools. Education will bring about awareness and the climate action we need.\u201d AF\\nLesein Mutunkei was 12 when he decided that for every football goal he scored, he\u2019d plant a tree. He realised the idea could go big \u2013 after all, \u201cthe climate crisis is a universal problem and football is a universal game\u201d. He got his school in Nairobi signed up and started Trees for Goals as a movement. In 2019, aged 14, he went to the Kenyan Ministry of Environment and the scheme became national. This year he\u2019s a Children\u2019s Climate prize finalist.\\nIf you could make one change\u2026 \u201cI would ensure Fifa, all leagues, clubs and schools and 3.5 billion fans across the world took up Trees for Goals and use the power of football to tackle deforestation, which is the second biggest contributor to climate change.\u201d AF\\nAmy and Ella Meek founded Kids Against Plastic in 2016 after finding out for the first time about the effects of plastic pollution. The sisters were being home schooled and their parents, both teachers, decided they should learn about the UN\u2019s global goals for sustainable development. The goal that piqued their interest was number 14: Life below water. \u201cWe started seeing all these images of sea creatures tangled up in plastic,\u201d says Amy, now 18. \u201cIt was just heartbreaking to see and really shocking.\u201d\\n\u201cPlastic pollution wasn\u2019t so much in the news then, so we were completely unaware of how the plastic we were using and throwing away was having such a negative impact,\u201d says Ella, 16. \u201cWe realised that a lot of other ordinary people were probably unaware of it too, so we decided to take action.\u201d\\nTheir campaign against plastic waste had small beginnings. \u201cWe were quite young, only 10 and 12, so we started off by litter picking. As soon as we started picking up plastic we saw how quickly it was being replaced and that was really motivating,\u201d says Ella.\\nIn the five years since the sisters have picked up a massive 96,685 pieces of single-use plastic. Their target is 100,000, because that is the number of sea mammals that die each year as a result of being trapped in plastic or eating it.

This involved \u201cmonths of tireless work \u2013 emails, backroom meetings, travelling from school to workplace to company HQs to persuade as many as we could to join us on the streets\u201d.

Members of the female-run faith group Camino to Cop26 have been walking a 500-mile route since early September.\\nTheirs is just one of a number of pilgrimages reaching Glasgow this weekend, with about 250 individuals expected, some coming from as far as Poland and Germany \u2013 one group has walked more than 1,000 miles from Sweden. Extinction Rebellion Scotland says their arrival will mark the \u201copening ceremony\u201d for nonviolent protests planned in the Scottish city and around the world during the UN climate talks.\\nFrom 18-year-old students to 74-year-old grandmothers, members of Camino to Cop26 \u2013 which is part of Extinction Rebellion \u2013 have been raising awareness about the climate and ecological crisis along the way. On some days they had 70 people walking with them. The group spent nights sleeping on the floors of churches, village halls and community centres, raising \u00a317,000 to cover their costs, with any additional money going to support the work of climate activists in developing countries.\\nWandering monk-like from place to place and surviving off the hospitality of local people is an ancient activity \u2013 in this case with a modern spin. The group\u2019s support vehicle was an electric van packed full of lentils and rice, and along the way they joined samba players under Birmingham\u2019s Spaghetti Junction, waved flags above the M6, and found spots for wild swimming. They also consumed a lot of vegan dinners.\\nThere were the same old aches and pains \u2013 blisters, dodgy knees, achilles heel injuries \u2013 as well as the challenge of spending eight weeks with a group of people they had never met before. In the 14th century\u2019s Canterbury Tales, Chaucer wrote about pilgrims telling stories to entertain one another along the way, and little has changed on that front. Belting out songs and poetry was encouraged, and there was even an impromptu barn dance thanks to one pilgrim who was good enough to carry a fiddle and bagpipes.\\nThey were only able to wash about once a week. \u201cI think I\u2019m quite smelly at this point,\u201d says Steph Alderton, 26, who is a few days from Glasgow when I speak to the group. Alderton has everything in a 10kg rucksack: one change of clothes, a few pairs of extra socks, a sleeping bag, sleeping mat, book, and packet of peanuts \u2013 standard packing. \u201cYou have to let go of your daily shower. The older people in the group say that was normal when they were young.\u201d\\nParticipants have a spectrum of beliefs, from devout Jews, Christians and Buddhists to committed atheists, like Alderton, who left a job as a career adviser at a school in Birmingham in June to put more energy into climate activism. The notion of \u201cintention\u201d is what makes a walk a pilgrimage, and for Steph it was not about reflecting on God, but learning about the UK\u2019s people and wildlife.\\n\u201cIt makes me feel so sad to know so many animals are going extinct. That\u2019s what drew me into the climate crisis, and walking the length of the country seemed like a good way to reflect on that connection with wildlife,\u201d says Alderton, who liked the outreach side of it and found speaking to people in their own communities made it easier to connect. \u201cEveryone needs one issue that is their gateway into activism and for many people that will be a local issue which leads them on to thinking about things more generally.\u201d\\nThe Rev Helen Burnett, vicar of St Peter and St Paul\u2019s Church in Chaldon, Surrey, helped organise the pilgrimage. As a Christian, she says she believes she must act now to fulfil her calling to \u201clove thy neighbour\u201d and care for vulnerable people. Inadvertently channelling Forrest Gump, Burnett led a Sunday service at her parish and then just kept walking. She was able to join the pilgrims for about half the time, yo-yoing up and down so she could spend the other half fulfilling duties in her parish.\\nShe was moved to walk because she believes more and more people are discovering God is in nature, not a building: \u201cSo many people, when you ask when they feel most connected to God will say \u2018on top of a mountain\u2019 or \u2018when I\u2019m in a garden\u2019, and I think that\u2019s really powerful. That was part of the Celtic tradition and the history of the church is we\u2019ve sort of domesticated God and popped him inside a nice, sanitised box, but people find God in the outside world.\u201d A few of her parishioners joined her on the walk.\\nCommunities the group passed through were surprised and delighted to see them, and some people applauded them as they passed, she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been thanked by construction workers, people at the school gates. They\u2019ve just thanked us. Ordinary people walking has a sort of resonance.\u201d\\nFor the 62-year-old, walking also means praying. \u201cWe now have doctors and science but we still find we resolve things by walking and praying,\u201d she says, \u201cit still seems to resonate, for people of faith and no faith, because you are stripping away the accretions of normal life \u2026 and only carrying what you need with you.\u201d\\nShe recently did a mini pilgrimage from Vauxhall station to Southwark Cathedral in south London. She says wandering without solely focusing on getting to the destination meant she saw more, such as the River Thames, marine mammal rescue teams, the Covid memorial wall. She believes that by walking towards a sacred place you are creating change within yourself \u2013 and it is important not to be busy when you do it.\\nFor her, the climate and ecological emergency will mean we need to get rid of a lot of \u201cstuff\u201d, and the changes will be greater than any other change her parishioners have undergone. \u201cThey know in their heart of hearts that something is up but it\u2019s so huge they don\u2019t know what to do. And they\u2019ve got to carry on their lives, and life is busy anyway.\u201d\\nBurnett feels as a religious leader she has to speak out: \u201cPoliticians want to get back into power, but speaking out as religious leaders we have less to lose.\u201d She has previously been arrested for failing to move off Lambeth Bridge during a climate crisis protest in the capital.\\nMelanie Nazareth, who is a barrister, organised the route with Burnett. When she started mapping it out in January this year, she plotted the quickest walking route, which was 450 miles, but then took out a directory of churches, emailed them, and plotted those that said yes to hosting them, which made the route a bit more wiggly, clocking up 500 miles in total. Christian Climate Action threw its weight behind the idea and helped with contacts. Nazareth found the final places for her pilgrims to stay just before they set off.\\nOrganising it became a full-time job in itself, she says, adding: \u201cThis is the biggest crisis of my lifetime. I have given up a lot of work to facilitate climate protest.\u201d\\nFor Nazareth, who is also Christian, speaking to people along the way has provided inspiration on how to live a more sustainable life. \u201cOne of the revelations has been going through rural communities and learning how we have a model that can be built upon \u2013 they eat more locally, grow a lot of their stuff, [are] proud of knowing where everything they eat comes from and producing it themselves.\u201d\\nMany people she met were good at recycling and reusing things, but when it came to talking about the need for political action to reduce carbon emissions, they said politicians didn\u2019t listen, she says, adding: \u201cThat sense of powerlessness has been there right from when we started [the walk].\u201d\\nNazareth turns 60 this year and says the walk has been a \u201ccomplete transformation\u201d on a personal level. Before this pilgrimage, her main form of walking was a gentle stroll after Sunday lunch, or going down to the station to catch the train. \u201cTo suddenly get up and do this has shown me that if I can do it, then people can step into their power and do things they can\u2019t imagine. They just need to take that first step \u2013 and when you take that first step, then you can make the second and the third.\u201d\\nDespite church-going numbers declining, a growing number of people are rediscovering the joy of pilgrimage around the world. Other pilgrimages arriving in Glasgow this weekend include Marcha a Glasgow, coming from Bilbao via Portsmouth; an ecumenical pilgrimage coming from Poland, Sweden and Germany; the Pilgrimage for Cop26, coming from Dunbar in Scotland; and the Young Christian Climate Network coming from the south-west of England.\\nWalking means different things to the Camino to Cop26 pilgrims, but it is fundamentally about trying to make a deeper connection with God, the countryside, its wildlife and people. Burnett says she believes that if more political delegates had walked to Cop26 they would have built a community that could begin to tackle the enormous challenges required. \u201cThey would have had to work things out differently in their hearts and relationships. Doing a pilgrimage forces you to do things differently.\u201d\\nThis article was amended on 2 November 2021 to correct some personal information.\\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/824fe8c9384d1163347460b2633f9f977ba9ef25/217_310_2548_1529/master/2548.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "The group walk through Cumbria"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e48a95f06b37ce349df4b24618820cc18cd44586/0_0_2003_3000/master/2003.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Camino to Cop26 flags on a vehicle"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3589e845560d7e5f3ab9f5afecd034ac67e19101/0_0_4000_4000/master/4000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Rev Helen Burnett and another walker"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/839283982262cc05a8266cdc3d3728fbe9c806fd/0_11_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Camino to Cop26 walkers"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca19a38ebcf2709222bb5b76f708a9e93c65a3b0/0_0_3000_2003/master/3000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Melanie Nazareth"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58b47c249baee01f135e89e948fa1daa5d4a998e/0_0_4000_2811/master/4000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Melanie Nazareth"]], "author": ["Phoebe Weston"], "date": "2021-10-31"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/17/inside-insulate-britain-on-the-road-with-disruptive-climate-group": {"title": "Inside Insulate Britain: on the road with the disruptive climate protesters", "subtitle": null, "text": "Roadblocks have caused anger but members say only maximum economic disruption will make politicians listen\\nThe riskiest time in Insulate Britain\u2019s road block protests is before the police arrive, their activists say. When they targeted a busy junction of the A1090 in Thurrock, Essex, on Wednesday morning, just outside the eastern edge of London, the police didn\u2019t appear for nearly an hour. No serious injuries were reported, but it was close.\\nThe first lorry, hurtling towards the T-junction, did not look like it was going to stop: it ground to a halt inches from the faces of three activists. Cars and vans mounted kerbs and central reservations to evade them. Motorists emerged from their vehicles, pink with rage, snatched protesters\u2019 banners and dragged them from the road like ragdolls.\\n\u201cAm I stopping you from insulating Britain?\u201d one lorry driver berated them. \u201cNo, I\u2019m fucking not. Go to the millionaire oligarchs, who own the fucking shit, and tell them to put the price down.\u201d\\nIn five weeks of disruptive road protests in and around London, Insulate Britain has polarised the country. Ministers have waxed apoplectic at \u201ceco-warriors\u201d who are \u201cdestroying people\u2019s lives\u201d, and Boris Johnson has called for new powers to \u201cinsulate them snugly in prison\u201d.\\nBut campaigners\u2019 key demand, that the government \u201cgets on with the job of insulating Britain\u2019s homes\u201d by 2030, is on everyone\u2019s lips. Even Keir Starmer vowed at the Labour party\u2019s conference to make home insulation a \u201cnational mission\u201d. It is a huge impact for a group that claims at most only 120 active members.\\nNow, with the climate activist group announcing a 10-day pause to the campaign, ostensibly to give the government time to consider its demands, the question is what it will do next. And with the crucial Cop26 climate summit due to begin in Glasgow at the end of the month, chances are it will be something dramatic.\\nThe night before Thurrock, 18 Insulate Britain members assembled in a rented house in south-east London. They were all in late middle age, inconspicuously dressed and well spoken \u2013 far from the \u201ccrusties\u201d evoked in the prime minister\u2019s denunciations. For one reason or another, they were all in a position to dedicate themselves to the cause full time.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a privilege thing,\u201d said Louise Lancaster, 56, who quit her job as a teacher to join the campaign. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously people in our society that there is no way they can do this, because they have to put food on the table and they can\u2019t take time out of work. We have people of all ages, but they are quite often slightly older people or slightly younger people.\u201d\\nThose the Guardian spoke to had all been involved in Extinction Rebellion, but some felt it had lost its way. \u201cI\u2019ve been on all these XR things; I\u2019d go out every day and get arrested,\u201d Chris Parish, 69, from Tower Hamlets said. \u201cBut it\u2019s sort of somehow at the moment been subsumed by the system \u2026 It\u2019s like a carnival. I don\u2019t want to criticise it, but I feel like something more needs to be done.\u201d\\nWhat sets Insulate Britain activists apart is not necessarily their willingness to go to prison, but their determination to do so. The group had hoped to have 50 climate prisoners jailed by the start of the Cop summit. \u201cIt would look so embarrassing for Boris Johnson to have elderly vicars in jail,\u201d Lancaster said.\\nThe group says 124 people have been arrested 629 times in 13 actions, according to its own estimates. But so far none have been held on remand for longer than a week. Police have said it is \u201cvery difficult\u201d to bring charges against them, while the government has responded with injunctions banning them from protesting on the M25, around the port of Dover and on critical London roads.\\nIn the kitchen, some helped prepare a meal of pasta and sauce, with rice, hummus and chopped peppers. Others gathered around the dining table, where they studied hand-drawn maps and computer printouts.\\n\u201cOne of the key elements in non-violent direct action is the need to disrupt,\u201d said one activist, who preferred not to be named. \u201cWhat we are really trying to do is bring economic pressure to the government through disruption, so an element in the choice of the site is trying to maximise economic disruption.\u201d\\nThey planned to hit a junction close to an area of warehouses and industrial units, including Amazon and Co-op distribution centres and the Daily Mail printworks. From there, lorries would be leaving to join the M25, London\u2019s orbital motorway, to deliver goods all over the capital and south-east England.\\nEfforts were made to avoid critical sites such as hospitals and schools, said another activist, who also asked to remain anonymous. \u201cThen we go to the sites to check them out,\u201d she said. \u201cToday there was another site I thought we could use, but there was a lot of children coming out of school and I didn\u2019t want them to be caught up.\u201d\\nActivists said that as far as they knew \u2013 and they had made inquiries, they said \u2013 no ambulances or genuine medical emergencies had been \u201cseriously delayed\u201d by their protests. \u201cIf we notice or hear the sirens for an ambulance, there are people who are generally moving about, coordinating and watching,\u201d one said. Sketching arrows in pink highlighter on a hand-drawn map, she showed the route an ambulance could take through the blockade they had planned.\\nThe following morning, looking for all intents and purposes like a church rambling group, activists travelled to Purfleet station via a chain of public transport connections.

A spokesperson for the group said this was the first time it had published any footage of the violent reactions its roadblocks had provoked. She said supportive responses to the clip, which has been viewed 1.7m times on Twitter, had galvanised activists.\\nInsulate Britain is midway through a 10-day pause in its campaign of disruptive protests on critical roads in and around London.

Around Basra in southern Iraq this summer, pressure on the grid owing to 50C heat led to constant blackouts, with residents driving around in their cars to stay cool.\\nKuwait broke the record for the hottest day ever in 2016 at 53.6, and its 10-day rolling average this summer was equally sweltering. Flash floods occurred in Jeddah, and more recently Mecca, while across Saudi Arabia average temperatures have increased by 2%, and the maximum temperatures by 2.5%, all just since the 1980s. In Qatar, the country with the highest per capita carbon emissions in the world and the biggest producer of liquid gas, the outdoors is already being air conditioned.\\nIn Tehran, air pollution kills 4,000 people each year, while in the south-west province of Khuzestan citizens blocked roads and burned tyres to protest against droughts caused by a combination of mismanagement, western sanctions and killer heat. In the United Arab Emirates it is estimated that the climate crisis costs \u00a36bn a year in higher health costs. The salinity of the Gulf, caused by proliferating desalination plants, has increased by 20%, with all the likely impact on marine life and biodiversity.\\nAnd it is, of course, going to get much worse, as temperatures, humidity and waters rise. The Middle East is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world. By the end of the century, if the more dire predictions prove true, Mecca may not be habitable, making the summer Haj a pilgrimage of peril, even catastrophe. Large tracts of the Middle East will resemble the desert in Ethiopia\u2019s Afar, a vast expanse with no permanent human settlement pressed against the Red Sea. The gleaming Gulf coastal cities by the end of the century could find themselves inundated as waters rise. It is not quite Apocalypse Now, but Apocalypse Foreseeably Soon.\\nJim Krane, an energy research analyst at Rice University Baker Institute in Houston, said: \u201cIt is a really tough issue because the interests of the ruling elites run contrary to the interests of citizens. The ruling elites are all dependent on oil rents for the survival of their regimes. They need the oil business to stay alive for them to stay in power. Their system is based on continued oil rent, but ultimately, the citizens\u2019 long-term interests are with a liveable climate\u201d.\\nZeina Khalil Hajj, a founder of Greenpeace in the Middle East, says that the region is under a double squeeze. \u201cAs demand for energy changes, a region that has been fundamentally reliant on fossil fuel, oil and carbon for its economic survival cannot continue with this dependence. There will be no market for their oil. But as its climate changes, it has an extra duty to shift for its own survival. Extreme weather is changing the lives of the people at a daily level. There is no choice, but to go green.\u201d\\nThe west\u2019s insatiable demand for fossil fuel has allowed this region to build car-dependent cities, full of shiny air-conditioned skyscrapers and malls. Now it has to find a way to avoid its self-destruction; this has to be, in Thomas Friedman\u2019s phrase, the Middle East\u2019s Promethean moment.\\nIn truth, the region has been told for at least a decade that it needs to make the transition out of oil. The precise point oil demand will peak has been contested, and depends on a myriad of assumptions about regulation, technology and consumer behaviour. But many people say demand will peak in about 2040, and then decline.\\nBut the International Energy Association\u2019s report Net Zero by 2050, by contrast, proposed oil demand fall from 88m barrels a day (mb/d) in 2020, to 72 mb/d in 2030 and to 24 mb/d in 2050, a fall of almost 75% between 2020 and 2050. It argued that the Gulf has all three elements needed to switch to renewables: capital, sun and large tracts of vacant land.\\nUntil recently there were few signs that the petro-states, including Iran, felt the need to get out of fossil fuels at that kind of pace.\\nAsked to comment on the IEA report, including its call for a cessation of new oil investments, the Saudi energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, famously described it as a sequel to La La Land. \u201cIf I had to be concerned with IEA projections,\u201d Abdulaziz said in Abu Dhabi during a public forum at the 24th World Energy Congress in 2019, \u201cI probably [would] be [on] Prozac all the time.\u201d\\nThe Qatari energy minister, Saad al-Kaabi, said cutting off oil and gas production would cause damaging supply crunches, and laughed at \u201cthe euphoria around energy transition\u201d. Opec\u2019s own projections suggest oil demand will rise in absolute terms through to 2045, and oil\u2019s share of world wide energy demand will fall only from 30% to 28%. Hardly a green revolution.\\nAnd looking at the current energy crunch, spiralling price of oil and predicted demand for oil this year, the case for a fast transition is harder to make than a year ago.\\nThe Gulf States are still highly reliant on oil and gas exports, which remain more than 70% of total goods exports in Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Oman, and on oil revenues, which exceed 70% of total government revenues in Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and Bahrain. In Vision 2030, published in 2016, the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, promised to turn the country into a diversified industrial power house. The reality is very different. The World Bank shows Saudi Arabia is still 75% dependent on oil exports for its budget.\\nAramco, the Saudi company with the largest carbon footprint in the world, is not trying to diversify at the rate of Shell or BP. Indeed, it has just announced an investment to increase crude capacity from 12m barrels a day to 13m barrels by 2027.\\nHajj says it may require a rapid psychological shift away from consumerism. \u201cThe Gulf is not even close to that kind of conversation. If you see the lifestyle in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, it is based on endless consumption. My fear is that we are so far away from it both in terms of policy and willingness\u201d.\\nIran is now the seventh-largest carbon emitter per capita, the UAE the second largest and Saudi Arabia the 13th.\\nOf course, the Gulf rulers at events such as Cop26 can fend off some criticism by arguing that the Gulf region is not itself collectively one of the great emitters, either now or historically. The region is responsible for only 4.7 % of worldwide carbon emissions, dwarfed by the pollution from Europe, America and China. The oil that the Middle East exports is logged against the carbon emissions of the users, not the producers.\\nYet the region\u2019s leaders now appear to be responding to pressure to act not only from the west, but their own population. The goose has finally realised the golden egg \u2013 oil \u2013 is turning brown. Frank Wouters, director of the EU-GCC Clean Energy Network, says that although even a year ago preaching about the green deal was not exactly rewarding (\u201cIt felt a bit like going to the butcher shop and telling them you want to become a vegetarian\u201d), attitudes are changing.\\nThe Gulf\u2019s self-proclaimed first mover, the UAE, was the first country in the region to ratify the Paris agreement and is now the least dependent on oil for government revenues. Last week it announced a \u201cnet zero initiative by 2050\u201d to be begun with $163bn (\u00a3118bn) of investments and a new minister for climate change and the environment, Mariam Almheiri. The announcement came after the UAE ordered an 80-day brainstorming session in every government department from June. It was the first petro-state to embrace net zero in domestic consumption.\\nThe plan is still in its infancy, and some of it is ill defined, but the direction is clear. It has promised to be 50% reliant on renewables and nuclear for its electricity by 2050. The Abu Dhabi national oil company has said it will source 100% of its grid power from nuclear and solar. Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum solar park is expected to be the largest lowest-cost single-site solar park in the world, with a planned production capacity of up to 5000MW. The price of solar coming out of the Middle East is also incredibly low.\\nGulf states are deeply competitive, so a flurry of news is emerging. Qatar has appointed a climate minister; Bahrain is targeting net zero by 2050; Kuwait has a new emissions plan.\\nSaudi Arabia, which rarely likes to be outdone by the UAE, had already said it would increase its share of renewables in electricity generation from a trivial 0.3% to 50% by 2030, as well as plant 10bn trees in the coming decades. At the weekend the world\u2019s largest oil producer staged an unprecedented Middle East Green Initiative Summit in Riyadh, an event that attracted broadly approving speeches from Prince Charles and John Kerry. It promised it would reach net zero carbon emissions within its borders by 2060, less ambitious than the request by Prince Charles to reach the target by 2050 with clear baselines. It also said it would reduce carbon emissions by 278m tonnes a year by 2030, more than double its previous target.\\nSenior Saudis say they have been maestros at summits, websites and visions, but true credibility stems from turning PR concepts such as a circular carbon economy into a reality. Many in the west are sceptical. Fossil fuels shipped abroad are not on the Saudi\u2019s carbon ledger, owing to UN accounting rules, and the promised internal reduction in emissions is dependent on a heavy bet that unproven blue hydrogen and carbon capture technology will work. Greenpeace Middle East suggested the summit was a fraud to please the US, as the Saudis\u2019 plan included increasing oil production. Others say at least Saudi has felt the need to join \u2013 rather than stall \u2013 the climate debate.\\nOne reason the Gulf monarchies have been able to be so slow in weaning themselves off the commodity that made them rich is that the wealth has been used to numb public opinion. Citizens have been bought off through a mixture of no taxes, along with water, petrol and energy subsidies. The dynamic is different in Lebanon, Iraq and to a lesser extent Iran. But that is changing, and small green civil society groups are starting to emerge, such as Kesk, Nature Iraq and Greenpeace Middle East.\\nThe issue, according to Israel\u2019s leftist vegan environment minister Tamar Zandberg, could transform some of the frozen inter-state politics of the Middle East for the better. Zandberg, who is working to get her own government to adopt net zero, says countries in the region have been very good at looking at the past. Climate change makes it essential they instead talk about a shared future. \u201cWe share the same problems, the same sun, the same lack of water, and the same collapse of our ecosystem.
