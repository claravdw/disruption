The information center will include posts from trusted scientific sources, rated by fact-checkers.', '“As with all types of claims debunked by our fact-checkers, we reduce the distribution of these posts in News Feed and apply a warning label on top of these posts both on Facebook and Instagram so people understand that the content has been rated false,” the company said.', 'But climate organizations have questioned whether Facebook is doing enough to cut down on untruths about the climate crisis that are spread across the site.

The proposal sets the stage for an intense political battle over the autumn to agree the target, intended to set the EU on track to meet a landmark pledge of net-zero emissions by the middle of the century.', 'But critics say Brussels is guilty of an “accounting trick” that makes the proposed 2030 target look higher than it really is. The row turns on the concept of “removals”, a reference to sinks that absorb more carbon than they emit, such as forests and soils.', 'The leaked draft regulation states that “by 2030 greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced and removals enhanced, so that net greenhouse gas emissions, that is emissions after deduction of removals are reduced economy-wide and domestically, by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.”', 'The previous version of the legal proposal, published in March, made no mention of removals in this context: the commission promised to “explore options for a new 2030 target of 50 to 55% emission reductions compared with 1990 levels”.', 'Greenpeace said the change was “risky” because nature was under massive pressure from global heating and biodiversity loss, highlighted by forest fires in western US, the Amazon and the Arctic.', '“This accounting trick by the commission would make any new target sound higher than it actually is,” said Sebastian Mang, climate and energy policy adviser at Greenpeace. “You can’t win a 100-metre race if you get someone else to run the last 20 metres. That’s called cheating. Restoring nature is essential, but must be additional to efforts to cut emissions in the most polluting sectors.”', 'The EU 2050 net-zero target means greenhouse gas emissions would be offset by carbon sinks. But the current 2030 target – a 40% emissions reduction compared to 1990 levels – does not include offsets.', 'Michael Bloss, a German Green MEP, told the Guardian the inclusion of removals was a deviation from the current system that could weaken the 2030 target. “It is a concern as the current legal framework for the EU’s 2030 target … defines the absolute reduction in greenhouse gas emissions,” he said.', 'The MEP added that deviating from the current approach was a form of “creative accounting” that would “undermine the leadership claim Europe wants to take” in UN climate talks.', 'The commission argues it makes sense to include carbon sinks, in line with the 2050 net-zero target. An EU official said the allegation of creative accounting was “incorrect” because “we also adjust the baseline for 1990 retrospectively” meaning there would be no “free” emissions reductions.', '“The accounting is still valid,” the source said. “I acknowledge there is still a discussion about where the EU carbon sink is and what it absorbs. That is to be clarified in the impact assessment for the LULUCF proposal that we will present next year,” they added, referring to another EU climate law governing land use, land use change and forestry.', 'The row comes after the European parliament’s environment committee voted last week for a 60% emissions reduction target by 2030, without including carbon sinks. The Greens, however, wanted a 65% target, which they argued was “the only way we will be able to keep global temperature rises under 1.5C [above pre-industrial levels] and stave off the worst effects of the climate crisis”.', 'Bloss added: “What we need is leadership on climate with a target in line with the science and not new uncertainties or even a further weakening of the 2030 target.”', 'The European commission said it did not comment on leaked documents.', 'Meanwhile, more than 150 companies have urged EU leaders to adopt tougher emissions targets for 2030. An open letter signed by 152 businesses and investment groups, including Microsoft, Unilever, Ikea and H&M, said the EU should reduce greenhouse gas emissions “by at least 55% by 2030”.', '“From a business and investor perspective, clarity on the net-zero transition pathway and timetables for each sector, as well as policy that enables substantial investments in carbon neutral solutions is essential,” states the text, also signed by Deutsche Bank, EDF and Google. “This in turn would provide us with the confidence needed to invest decisively at the necessary pace and scale.”']",['Jennifer Rankin'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42cff76ebdf9b49444539650b27421d2a67a640d/0_102_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'Greenpeace activists roll down a 30-metre banner at the headquarters of the EU Commission protesting against the ongoing damage to the Amazon.']]",

Being brave, gung ho gals, Catherine and Rosanna were all for it and pledged to join me when they could.', 'Over the next few days we hiked, and I kept reading Naomi’s book. I felt more strongly that if I got the word out, others would join me. It had happened before during the later years of the Vietnam war. I’ve done a lot of camping in my life and had all the right equipment, but I’d never camped in a city. Where will I poop and pee? I wondered. I’m way older now and have to get up during the night more often. We studied maps of DC, trying to pick a spot where I would set up, but I realised I didn’t want a lonely vigil.

In fact, leaps of faith are my only form of exercise these days.', 'There was a long silence, and then she said, “Well, Jane, that’s wonderful and I’m blown away that you’re ready to put yourself out there like that, but you can’t camp overnight in Washington. It’s illegal since Occupy Wall Street camped there. But let’s figure out what is possible.” She offered to set up a conference call with her, Bill McKibben, co-founder of 350.org, Naomi Klein, the environmental lawyer Jay Halfon, and me. Bill suggested a once-a-week protest that involved civil disobedience. Fridays had been claimed by Greta Thunberg and the student climate strikers, but the youth had also called on adults to join them. “Maybe you could do an action on Fridays as well.”', 'I’d been getting ready for this my whole adult life – a weekly action that culminated in nonviolent civil disobedience.

It’s structural change that we need to focus on while continuing our individual commitments to the planet. Maybe the Friday actions would help bring about that policy change.', 'On 27 September, en route to the Los Angeles airport, my little Tulea had a seizure; she had been diagnosed with an enlarged heart.

A new coronavirus was sweeping the world. Politicians had to make their most consequential decisions in decades, and fast. Many of those decisions depended on data detective work that epidemiologists, medical statisticians and economists were scrambling to conduct. Tens of millions of lives were potentially at risk.

And the tests that were being conducted were giving a skewed picture, being focused on medical staff, critically ill patients, and – let’s face it – rich, famous people. It took several months to build a picture of how many mild or asymptomatic cases there are, and hence how deadly the virus really is. As the death toll rose exponentially in March, doubling every two days in the UK, there was no time to wait and see. Leaders put economies into an induced coma – more than 3 million Americans filed jobless claims in a single week in late March, five times the previous record. The following week was even worse: more than 6.5m claims were filed. Were the potential health consequences really catastrophic enough to justify sweeping away so many people’s incomes? It seemed so – but epidemiologists could only make their best guesses with very limited information.', 'It’s hard to imagine a more extraordinary illustration of how much we usually take accurate, systematically gathered numbers for granted. The statistics for a huge range of important issues that predate the coronavirus have been painstakingly assembled over the years by diligent statisticians, and often made available to download, free of charge, anywhere in the world. Yet we are spoiled by such luxury, casually dismissing “lies, damned lies and statistics”. The case of Covid-19 reminds us how desperate the situation can become when the statistics simply aren’t there.', 'When it comes to interpreting the world around us, we need to realise that our feelings can trump our expertise. This explains why we buy things we don’t need, fall for the wrong kind of romantic partner, or vote for politicians who betray our trust. In particular, it explains why we so often buy into statistical claims that even a moment’s thought would tell us cannot be true. Sometimes, we want to be fooled.', 'Psychologist Ziva Kunda found this effect in the lab, when she showed experimental subjects an article laying out the evidence that coffee or other sources of caffeine could increase the risk to women of developing breast cysts. Most people found the article pretty convincing. Women who drank a lot of coffee did not.', 'We often find ways to dismiss evidence that we don’t like. And the opposite is true, too: when evidence seems to support our preconceptions, we are less likely to look too closely for flaws. It is not easy to master our emotions while assessing information that matters to us, not least because our emotions can lead us astray in different directions.', 'We don’t need to become emotionless processors of numerical information – just noticing our emotions and taking them into account may often be enough to improve our judgment. Rather than requiring superhuman control of our emotions, we need simply to develop good habits. Ask yourself: how does this information make me feel? Do I feel vindicated or smug? Anxious, angry or afraid? Am I in denial, scrambling to find a reason to dismiss the claim?', 'In the early days of the coronavirus epidemic, helpful-seeming misinformation spread even faster than the virus itself. One viral post – circulating on Facebook and email newsgroups – all-too-confidently explained how to distinguish between Covid-19 and a cold, reassured people that the virus was destroyed by warm weather, and incorrectly advised that iced water was to be avoided, while warm water kills any virus. The post, sometimes attributed to “my friend’s uncle”, sometimes to “Stanford hospital board” or some blameless and uninvolved paediatrician, was occasionally accurate but generally speculative and misleading. But still people – normally sensible people – shared it again and again and again. Why? Because they wanted to help others. They felt confused, they saw apparently useful advice, and they felt impelled to share. That impulse was only human, and it was well-meaning – but it was not wise.', 'Before I repeat any statistical claim, I first try to take note of how it makes me feel. It’s not a foolproof method against tricking myself, but it’s a habit that does little harm, and is sometimes a great deal of help. Our emotions are powerful. We can’t make them vanish, and nor should we want to. But we can, and should, try to notice when they are clouding our judgment.', 'In 1997, the economists Linda Babcock and George Loewenstein ran an experiment in which participants were given evidence from a real court case about a motorbike accident. They were then randomly assigned to play the role of plaintiff’s attorney (arguing that the injured motorcyclist should receive $100,000 in damages) or defence attorney (arguing that the case should be dismissed or the damages should be low).', 'The experimental subjects were given a financial incentive to argue their side of the case persuasively, and to reach an advantageous settlement with the other side. They were also given a separate financial incentive to accurately guess what the damages the judge in the real case had actually awarded. Their predictions should have been unrelated to their role-playing, but their judgment was strongly influenced by what they hoped would be true.', 'Psychologists call this “motivated reasoning”. Motivated reasoning is thinking through a topic with the aim, conscious or unconscious, of reaching a particular kind of conclusion. In a football game, we see the fouls committed by the other team but overlook the sins of our own side. We are more likely to notice what we want to notice. Experts are not immune to motivated reasoning. Under some circumstances their expertise can even become a disadvantage. The French satirist Molière once wrote: “A learned fool is more foolish than an ignorant one.” Benjamin Franklin commented: “So convenient a thing is it to be a reasonable creature, since it enables us to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to.”', 'Modern social science agrees with Molière and Franklin: people with deeper expertise are better equipped to spot deception, but if they fall into the trap of motivated reasoning, they are able to muster more reasons to believe whatever they really wish to believe.', 'One recent review of the evidence concluded that this tendency to evaluate evidence and test arguments in a way that is biased towards our own preconceptions is not only common, but just as common among intelligent people. Being smart or educated is no defence. In some circumstances, it may even be a weakness.', 'One illustration of this is a study published in 2006 by two political scientists, Charles Taber and Milton Lodge. They wanted to examine the way Americans reasoned about controversial political issues. The two they chose were gun control and affirmative action.', 'Taber and Lodge asked their experimental participants to read a number of arguments on either side, and to evaluate the strength and weakness of each argument. One might hope that being asked to review these pros and cons might give people more of a shared appreciation of opposing viewpoints; instead, the new information pulled people further apart.', 'This was because people mined the information they were given for ways to support their existing beliefs. When invited to search for more information, people would seek out data that backed their preconceived ideas. When invited to assess the strength of an opposing argument, they would spend considerable time thinking up ways to shoot it down.', 'This isn’t the only study to reach this sort of conclusion, but what’s particularly intriguing about Taber and Lodge’s experiment is that expertise made matters worse. More sophisticated participants in the experiment found more material to back up their preconceptions. More surprisingly, they found less material that contradicted them – as though they were using their expertise actively to avoid uncomfortable information. They produced more arguments in favour of their own views, and picked up more flaws in the other side’s arguments. They were vastly better equipped to reach the conclusion they had wanted to reach all along.', 'Of all the emotional responses we might have, the most politically relevant are motivated by partisanship. People with a strong political affiliation want to be on the right side of things. We see a claim, and our response is immediately shaped by whether we believe “that’s what people like me think”.', 'Consider this claim about climate change: “Human activity is causing the Earth’s climate to warm up, posing serious risks to our way of life.” Many of us have an emotional reaction to a claim like that; it’s not like a claim about the distance to Mars. Believing it or denying it is part of our identity; it says something about who we are, who our friends are, and the sort of world we want to live in. If I put a claim about climate change in a news headline, or in a graph designed to be shared on social media, it will attract attention and engagement not because it is true or false, but because of the way people feel about it.', 'If you doubt this, ponder the findings of a Gallup poll conducted in 2015. It found a huge gap between how much Democrats and Republicans in the US worried about climate change. What rational reason could there be for that?', 'Scientific evidence is scientific evidence. Our beliefs around climate change shouldn’t skew left and right. But they do. This gap became wider the more education people had. Among those with no college education, 45% of Democrats and 23% of Republicans worried “a great deal” about climate change. Yet among those with a college education, the figures were 50% of Democrats and 8% of Republicans. A similar pattern holds if you measure scientific literacy: more scientifically literate Republicans and Democrats are further apart than those who know very little about science.', 'If emotion didn’t come into it, surely more education and more information would help people to come to an agreement about what the truth is – or at least, the current best theory? But giving people more information seems actively to polarise them on the question of climate change. This fact alone tells us how important our emotions are. People are straining to reach the conclusion that fits with their other beliefs and values – and the more they know, the more ammunition they have to reach the conclusion they hope to reach.', 'In the case of climate change, there is an objective truth, even if we are unable to discern it with perfect certainty. But as you are one individual among nearly 8 billion on the planet, the environmental consequences of what you happen to think are irrelevant. With a handful of exceptions – say, if you’re the president of China – climate change is going to take its course regardless of what you say or do. From a self-centred point of view, the practical cost of being wrong is close to zero. The social consequences of your beliefs, however, are real and immediate.', 'Imagine that you’re a barley farmer in Montana, and hot, dry summers are ruining your crop with increasing frequency. Climate change matters to you. And yet rural Montana is a conservative place, and the words “climate change” are politically charged. Anyway, what can you personally do about it?', 'Here’s how one farmer, Erik Somerfeld, threads that needle, as described by the journalist Ari LeVaux: “In the field, looking at his withering crop, Somerfeld was unequivocal about the cause of his damaged crop – ‘climate change’. But back at the bar, with his friends, his language changed. He dropped those taboo words in favour of ‘erratic weather’ and ‘drier, hotter summers’ – a not-uncommon conversational tactic in farm country these days.”', 'If Somerfeld lived in Portland, Oregon, or Brighton, East Sussex, he wouldn’t need to be so circumspect at his local tavern – he’d be likely to have friends who took climate change very seriously indeed. But then those friends would quickly ostracise someone else in the social group who went around loudly claiming that climate change is a Chinese hoax.', 'So perhaps it is not so surprising after all to find educated Americans poles apart on the topic of climate change. Hundreds of thousands of years of human evolution have wired us to care deeply about fitting in with those around us. This helps to explain the findings of Taber and Lodge that better-informed people are actually more at risk of motivated reasoning on politically partisan topics: the more persuasively we can make the case for what our friends already believe, the more our friends will respect us.', 'It’s far easier to lead ourselves astray when the practical consequences of being wrong are small or non-existent, while the social consequences of being “wrong” are severe. It’s no coincidence that this describes many controversies that divide along partisan lines.', 'It’s tempting to assume that motivated reasoning is just something that happens to other people. I have political principles; you’re politically biased; he’s a fringe conspiracy theorist. But we would be wiser to acknowledge that we all think with our hearts rather than our heads sometimes.', 'Kris De Meyer, a neuroscientist at King’s College, London, shows his students a message describing an environmental activist’s problem with climate change denialism:', 'To summarise the climate deniers’ activities, I think we can say that:', '(1) Their efforts have been aggressive while ours have been defensive.', '(2) The deniers’ activities are rather orderly – almost as if they had a plan working for them.', 'I think the denialist forces can be characterised as dedicated opportunists. They are quick to act and seem to be totally unprincipled in the type of information they use to attack the scientific community. There is no question, though, that we have been inept in getting our side of the story, good though it may be, across to the news media and the public.', 'The students, all committed believers in climate change, outraged at the smokescreen laid down by the cynical and anti-scientific deniers, nod in recognition. Then De Meyer reveals the source of the text. It’s not a recent email. It’s taken, sometimes word for word, from an infamous internal memo written by a cigarette marketing executive in 1968. The memo is complaining not about “climate deniers” but about “anti-cigarette forces”, but otherwise, few changes were required.', 'You can use the same language, the same arguments, and perhaps even have the same conviction that you’re right, whether you’re arguing (rightly) that climate change is real or (wrongly) that the cigarette-cancer link is not.', '(Here’s an example of this tendency that, for personal reasons, I can’t help but be sensitive about. My left-leaning, environmentally conscious friends are justifiably critical of ad hominem attacks on climate scientists. You know the kind of thing: claims that scientists are inventing data because of their political biases, or because they’re scrambling for funding from big government. In short, smearing the person rather than engaging with the evidence.', 'Yet the same friends are happy to embrace and amplify the same kind of tactics when they are used to attack my fellow economists: that we are inventing data because of our political biases, or scrambling for funding from big business. I tried to point out the parallel to one thoughtful person, and got nowhere. She was completely unable to comprehend what I was talking about. I’d call this a double standard, but that would be unfair – it would suggest that it was deliberate. It’s not. It’s an unconscious bias that’s easy to see in others and very hard to see in ourselves.)', 'Our emotional reaction to a statistical or scientific claim isn’t a side issue. Our emotions can, and often do, shape our beliefs more than any logic. We are capable of persuading ourselves to believe strange things, and to doubt solid evidence, in service of our political partisanship, our desire to keep drinking coffee, our unwillingness to face up to the reality of our HIV diagnosis, or any other cause that invokes an emotional response.', 'But we shouldn’t despair. We can learn to control our emotions – that is part of the process of growing up. The first simple step is to notice those emotions. When you see a statistical claim, pay attention to your own reaction. If you feel outrage, triumph, denial, pause for a moment. Then reflect. You don’t need to be an emotionless robot, but you could and should think as well as feel.', 'Most of us do not actively wish to delude ourselves, even when that might be socially advantageous. We have motives to reach certain conclusions, but facts matter, too. Lots of people would like to be movie stars, billionaires or immune to hangovers, but very few people believe that they actually are. Wishful thinking has limits. The more we get into the habit of counting to three and noticing our knee-jerk reactions, the closer to the truth we are likely to get.', 'For example, one survey, conducted by a team of academics, found that most people were perfectly able to distinguish serious journalism from fake news, and also agreed that it was important to amplify the truth, not lies. Yet the same people would happily share headlines such as “Over 500 ‘Migrant Caravaners’ Arrested With Suicide Vests”, because at the moment at which they clicked “share”, they weren’t stopping to think. They weren’t thinking, “Is this true?”, and they weren’t thinking, “Do I think the truth is important?”', 'Instead, as they skimmed the internet in that state of constant distraction that we all recognise, they were carried away with their emotions and their partisanship. The good news is that simply pausing for a moment to reflect was all it took to filter out a lot of the misinformation. It doesn’t take much; we can all do it. All we need to do is acquire the habit of stopping to think.', 'Inflammatory memes or tub-thumping speeches invite us to leap to the wrong conclusion without thinking. That’s why we need to be calm.

But after Europe cracked down on migration, its crew found themselves facing prosecution', 'As patrol boats with flashing blue lights surrounded the Iuventa, just outside the port of Lampedusa on the evening of 1 August 2017, its crew were more annoyed than alarmed. For three days, the old fishing trawler, crewed by volunteers from the German NGO Jugend Rettet (Youth Rescue), had answered a string of requests from the Italian coastguard that to them made no sense. “This madness hopefully will soon be over,” read a message sent from the ship’s bridge to Jugend Rettet base camp shortly after 10pm.', 'In the summer of 2017, two years on from the peak of Europe’s refugee crisis, smugglers in Libya were still sending hundreds of people a day to sea in unsafe rubber boats, and the Iuventa’s crew wanted to be where the action was. In a patch of sea just off the coast of north Africa, about a dozen NGO ships were searching for boats in distress – a direct challenge, as many of them saw it, to European governments that had scaled back state-run rescue efforts.', 'Yet the Iuventa had been following instructions that drew it further away from the rescue zone and closer to Italian territorial waters. According to the ship’s records, the Italian coastguard first told the crew to rendezvous with an Italian navy ship to collect two men found adrift at sea, and deliver them to another. The second ship never turned up. Then they were told to look for a blue and white fishing boat with 50 people on board, apparently foundering in the sea close to Lampedusa. As night fell on 1 August, after a day spent searching the waves in vain, a message came through: call off your search and proceed into port.', 'It was the third time in a few months that the ship had been ordered into the harbour at Lampedusa. In just over a year, the Iuventa – crewed by a group of young, motivated people “who could not stand to see the situation in the Mediterranean any longer”, as one put it to me – rescued more than 14,000 people. Most of these rescues were coordinated by the Italian coastguard, but the relationship was increasingly strained. The Iuventa’s revolving crew of volunteers were outspoken critics of Europe’s border policies, and the small, agile ship took more risks than some of the larger NGO vessels, sailing as close as possible to Libyan waters in order to be able to rescue people from unsafe boats sooner. As one Italian media outlet put it, the ship was “like a sort of Berliner squat out in the middle of the sea – very well organised, radical and antagonistic”.', 'As the Iuventa entered the harbour of Lampedusa, the crew expected to be questioned briefly by police, as they had been on previous occasions, then allowed to get back to work. They were wrong. Within a few hours, their ship would be seized, marking the beginning of a long and still unresolved criminal investigation that leaves 10 humanitarian volunteers facing up to 20 years in prison.', 'In the small hours of 2 August, while a crowd of journalists assembled on the quayside filmed and took photographs, detectives specialising in organised crime searched the Iuventa. The following morning, before the crew were even fully informed of the case against them, details were splashed across the Italian media. This “German extremist NGO”, as one newspaper later put it, was suspected of aiding illegal immigration – a crime in Italian law – by collaborating with Libyan smugglers. News outlets quoted liberally from a case file that showed the Iuventa had been under surveillance for months: there were even transcripts from a recording device placed on the ship’s bridge. Police photographs, labelled and distributed to news agencies, purported to show several occasions on which the ship’s crew had received migrants directly from boats driven by smugglers themselves.', '“We don’t have anything to hide, and we are looking forward to returning to the search and rescue zone one day, to fight for human rights,” declared a member of the crew, who gave her name as Katrin, in a video statement released to the media. But these were explosive allegations, at a time when migration had become such a toxic issue that Italy’s interior minister declared he “feared for the democratic integrity of the country”. Italy’s populist opposition parties led the charge against rescuers, accusing them of being taxi del mare, a “sea taxi” service for migrants, while the government was pressuring NGOs to limit their operations. In the spring of 2017, two other NGOs had been investigated – but this was the first time a ship had been seized. Within months, under the looming threat of prosecution, NGOs were all but forced out of the Mediterranean.', 'Today, the Iuventa remains impounded, and 10 of its crew members are still waiting to find out if they will face trial. They deny ever working with smugglers, and have assembled documentary evidence that they say proves their innocence. More disturbingly, investigative journalists in Italy and elsewhere have unearthed evidence which appears to show that the surveillance began not with the Italian state, but with a spying plot involving a private security agency and the far-right political leader Matteo Salvini.', 'The case is not yet over, but it has already marked a turning point: in just a few years, Europe has gone from saving lives at sea to attacking the people who do it. And it all began with the moment, in the words of the Italian author and migration specialist Annalisa Camilli, that “humanitarians were transformed from angels at sea into dangerous collaborators with smugglers”.', 'More than three years since he last sailed a rescue mission, Dariush Beigui’s mind still clicks into gear when he sees news of a boat in distress in the Mediterranean. The German skipper, a punk rock fan who pilots barges around the port of Hamburg for a living, mentally prepares to wake up his crewmates, to manoeuvre the Iuventa into position and scan the horizon with binoculars, ready to dispatch the ship’s speedboat. But with the Iuventa sitting idle in the Sicilian port of Trapani, none of this is possible. “The hardest thing for me is to sit here watching social media, knowing that if I was there I could help,” he told me. “Maybe not to rescue everybody, but at least one person.”', 'I met Beigui in Berlin in early 2020, along with two other members of the “Iuventa 10”, Hendrik Simon and Sascha Girke. All three, now in their early 40s, volunteered to work on the Iuventa after Jugend Rettet launched in 2015 via a crowdfunding campaign. Many of the volunteers knew each other from past campaigns in environmentalist, antifascist and squatting movements, and they brought practical skills to the Mediterranean, along with a DIY ethos: Girke works as a paramedic in a town outside Berlin; Simon, an IT technician from Bremen, had driven speedboats for Greenpeace.', 'In the summer of 2016, when the Iuventa first went to sea, the number of people crossing the central Mediterranean from Libya was at record levels. The people-smuggling trade, once tightly controlled by the former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on Europe’s behalf, had boomed as the country collapsed into civil war. Since the overthrow of Gaddafi in 2011, tens of thousands of people a year – displaced by war, looking for work, or just desperate to get out of Libya – paid for passage on overcrowded inflatable dinghies that were pushed out to sea with only a few hours’ worth of fuel. Unless given assistance, once they got into open water, these boats would sink. In 2016, more than 4,500 people drowned or went missing in the Mediterranean.', 'An increasing proportion of the rescues were carried out by private organisations. By 2016, nine separate charities, from global aid agencies such as Save the Children and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) to smaller, newly formed groups, patrolled international waters close to Libya.', 'The Iuventa quickly gained a reputation as one of the more daring rescue outfits. “Saving people from drowning is always a humanitarian act,” Simon told me, “[but] I was going there as a political activist because I don’t agree with European border policies.” While the Iuventa put its speed and agility to use at sea, Jugend Rettet’s volunteers held protest actions on land, calling for “ferries not Frontex” – the provocative suggestion, with reference to the EU’s border agency, that migrants should be allowed to travel freely.', 'Yet 2016 was also the year that anti-refugee politics came to the fore in Europe and the US. Italy, where the majority of people rescued off the coast of Libya disembarked, was finding itself increasingly isolated. Three years earlier, in response to a growing number of shipwrecks on its southern border, Italy had taken the bold step of sending its navy out into international waters to search for boats in distress. The country’s centre-left government gambled that the operation, which it called Mare Nostrum – “our sea” in Latin, after the ancient Roman name for the Mediterranean – would prompt its European neighbours into supporting the rescue effort, and helping look after the people rescued.', 'The hoped-for support never arrived. Mare Nostrum was replaced by a far smaller EU operation, while responsibility for accommodating new arrivals remained with the country in which they disembarked. As Europe’s increasingly panicked governments discussed how to reduce migration across the Mediterranean, Italy’s neighbours began to seal off their land borders, preventing asylum seekers from continuing their journeys. By late 2016, around 200,000 people were stuck in Italy’s slow-moving asylum system, management of which cost well over €3bn a year.', 'Italian coastguard officials began to take a less welcoming attitude to the NGO rescuers. “There was increasingly this delaying and questioning of our missions,” said Girke, who volunteered multiple times as coordinator, either on board the Iuventa or at Jugend Rettet base camp on Malta. One point of contention seemed to be that the Iuventa would often transfer the people it picked up to better-equipped larger ships, so it could quickly return to the rescue zone. According to Girke, officials would often try to insist that the Iuventa took all the people it had rescued back to port – he suspects, to slow down its operations.', 'In October 2016, three employees of a private security agency visited police in Trapani. The three had been working as security guards on board the Vos Hestia, a ship chartered by the UK aid organisation Save the Children, as a condition of the vessel’s insurance. On 10 September, the Vos Hestia had crossed paths with the Iuventa during a rescue: a long, gruelling day of pulling people out of the water, in which six dinghies, each with more than a hundred people onboard, were adrift and sinking. The Iuventa’s deck had become dangerously busy, and the Vos Hestia was one of several ships that arrived to help relieve the pressure.', 'One of the security guards, Pietro Gallo, told police that shortly after the Vos Hestia took some of the Iuventa’s passengers on board, he saw a dinghy heading away from the Iuventa, driven by two “dark-skinned” men. This, he said, “made us believe that the crew of the Iuventa had received migrants from the dinghy … which was returning to the [Libyan] coast with the smugglers onboard.” The security guards assumed this meant that the Iuventa had collected migrants from smugglers by prior arrangement, rather than rescuing people whose lives were in danger.', 'Had the Iuventa’s crew committed a crime? They say they had no contact with smugglers, pointing out that no evidence besides the security guards’ testimony has been offered for the incident, and that several other vessels including an Irish navy ship were present at the scene. Nor, they say, was the alleged incident mentioned in the official Frontex report on that day’s rescue. But after the allegations from security guards, prosecutors in Trapani authorised a surveillance operation, placing an undercover officer on Save the Children’s ship. The officer would pose as a security guard alongside Gallo and his colleagues, watching the Iuventa from afar.', 'In late November, the Iuventa entered port for the winter. By the end of the year, 181,436 people had been rescued from the central Mediterranean – and Italy appeared to welcome the contribution of the NGOs. At the end of the year, Girke told me, he attended a meeting in Rome with the Italian coastguard, to discuss how they could improve cooperation. “They were asking us to come back next year with bigger ships,” he said.', 'In the spring of 2017, six months after Gallo and his colleagues visited the police in Trapani, the prominent opposition politician Salvini made a startling claim on the TV talkshow In mezz’ora (“In half an hour”). In a heated debate with a representative of MSF, Salvini stated that he had seen a dossier by Italy’s secret services about contact between people smugglers and some of the NGOs. “There are weapons and drugs onboard some of those ships,” he added.', '“How do you know?” asked the presenter, clearly taken aback.', '“I listen to the people who work on these boats,” Salvini replied.', 'No more details of the “phantom dossier”, as one media outlet described it, ever emerged. But Salvini had been in contact with the security guards on board the Vos Hestia. According to Gallo, in September 2016, the trio emailed AISE, the Italian secret service, with their suspicions about the Iuventa. When nobody there responded, said Gallo, they tried Salvini.', '“[Salvini] called back a few minutes later,” Gallo told the newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano last year. “He wanted to meet us immediately, but we explained that we were about to embark, so he gave us the number of one of his contacts.” According to Gallo, Salvini asked them to secretly document what they saw at sea, and pass the information on to his office via an intermediary.', 'Salvini has only partially confirmed the account, telling Il Fatto Quotidiano that he “disseminated” some “highly interesting” information he received from one of Gallo’s colleagues. What we do know, however, is that in the early months of 2017, Salvini transformed the fortunes of the party he leads, the Lega Nord, by helping bring the claim that NGO rescuers were collaborating with smugglers from the far-right fringe into the mainstream of political debate.', 'The situation in the Mediterranean had become a rallying point for far-right activists across Europe. In December 2016, the Gefira Foundation, an obscure Dutch thinktank that purports to monitor the “extinction” of Europe’s “indigenous peoples”, published a report in which it claimed that search and rescue was a “scam” in which “NGOs, smugglers, the mafia, in cahoots with the European Union, have shipped thousands of illegals into Europe under the pretext of rescuing people”. Within weeks, similar claims then began to circulate among far-right social media accounts.', 'The narrative entered Italian politics, too. In February 2017, a Sicilian prosecutor called Carmelo Zuccaro announced a taskforce to investigate the NGOs, later claiming that smugglers and rescuers were colluding in order to destabilise the Italian economy. The following month, a hitherto unknown blogger, a 23-year-old media and communications student from Turin called Luca Donadel, posted a video to his Facebook page titled “the truth about migrants”, which argued that NGOs were running a “taxi service” for financial gain. Within days, Donadel’s video went viral, shared by Salvini on his own social media accounts, and discussed on Striscia la notizia, a popular satirical TV show. Italy’s other main opposition party, the Five Star Movement, joined the fray, and by April the accusation that the NGOs were “sea taxis” – a phrase coined by the Five Star Movement’s then leader, Luigi Di Maio, dominated the airwaves.', 'As the moral panic intensified, state surveillance of the Iuventa stepped up a gear. In May, the ship was twice ordered to leave the rescue zone near Libya and dock at Lampedusa. Beigui, Girke and Simon now think that this is when the ship’s bridge was bugged, although at the time they had no idea. “Maybe it was a bit naive,” said Simon, “but we were thinking like: ‘Come on, we are rescuing people from drowning, what’s the worst that could happen?’”', 'Italy’s government, under pressure from both its domestic opposition and other European states to reduce migration, was turning against the rescuers. Marco Minniti, a former political head of the intelligence services, had taken over as interior minister at the end of 2016. Unlike his predecessors, Minniti was convinced that the priority was to prevent migrants from leaving Libya. He struck deals with several of the armed groups that controlled Libya, offering training to what remained of the country’s coastguard – and negotiating with the militias that controlled smuggling in the coastal cities, to put a halt to migration.', 'As summer 2017 approached, however, the numbers leaving Libya reached a new record. At the end of June, Minniti had a flight to Washington DC turned around when he heard the news that 12,000 people, rescued from the Mediterranean in the space of a few days, were making their way to Italian ports. After an emergency summit, in which Italian officials briefed the media that NGOs were to blame for encouraging people smugglers, Minniti unveiled a tough new code of conduct for rescue vessels. It included the demand that boats bring rescued migrants directly to port rather than transferring them to larger ships, a condition that would have severely limited the operations of smaller vessels like the Iuventa. Several NGOs, including Jugend Rettet, refused to sign the document in its original form; MSF said the code would lead to “more drownings”.', 'By mid-August, it seemed as though Minniti’s agreements in Libya were finally taking effect. The number of people crossing the Mediterranean fell drastically. But as lurid details from the Iuventa case file spread throughout the media, the NGOs were now the centre of attention. “The NGOs don’t give a toss about migrants, it’s just the business opportunity of the moment,” said “Lucio M”, one of the security guards who worked with Gallo on board the Vos Hestia', 'A wide section of Italian society, and most of its politicians, had come to see the rescuers as a threat. Donations to the aid organisations plummeted, and in the second half of 2017 several of the major operators, including Save the Children and MSF, suspended or halted their rescue missions. Anti-immigration sentiment continued to rise – and by the autumn, even Pope Francis, a vocal supporter of migrants’ rights and humanitarian rescue, appeared to give ground. In September, he stated that it was understandable for “a country which has done so much, like Italy, to ask itself: can I host everyone? Do I have enough space?”', 'As a general election approached in early 2018, opposition politicians continued to attack the government on migration, with Salvini leading the charge. Support for the Lega soared: as recently as 2014 the party was supported by just 6% of the population; in 2018 it received 17%. The rightwing electoral alliance it formed part of topped the poll, with 37% of the vote. Entering coalition with the Five Star Movement, Salvini was appointed interior minister.', 'One idea – that saving people from drowning only encourages others to make the journey – has come to dominate Europe’s response to migration across the Mediterranean. Depending on your point of view, this is either hard-headed realism – or a terrifying, inhumane calculation. But the debate that surrounds this issue almost always obscures the perspectives of the people who attempt the journey.', 'In October 2016, at around the same time that Gallo and his colleagues were talking to detectives in Trapani, a young man from Gambia called Malik saw what he calls “a miracle out of nowhere”. The 20-year-old was crammed with 130 others into a dinghy launched that morning from Libya, the weather had turned rough and the dinghy was starting to sink. As people around him said their prayers and prepared for death, Malik spotted a ship on the horizon. Taking a white shirt from a fellow passenger, he stood up and waved it furiously.', '“They told us to stay calm, that we’d all be rescued,” said Malik when I spoke to him recently. “They gave us life vests and towed our boat all the way to the ship, and we got out one by one.” Malik, who left his home in Gambia in 2014 after his father stabbed him during a drunken argument, was one of two people rescued by the Iuventa who I tracked down earlier this year. His journey to the Mediterranean had been brutal. He had borrowed money to pay for his passage across the Sahara desert, then worked on building sites in Libya, hoping to save up enough money for a journey to Europe. But he was kidnapped and held for ransom by one smuggling gang, then detained by another in a camp near the coast for seven months until his mother sent him money to buy his way out.', 'Abdulrahman, who left his home in Sierra Leone during an outbreak of Ebola and was just 16 when he was saved from a waterlogged dinghy in August 2016, had a similar story. He told me that by the time he left Libya, he was so desperate that he had spent five days hiding among trees and scavenging for food outside the port of Sabratha, looking for a way to sneak into the camp where smugglers were sending boats out to sea. “In Libya, trust me, there is slavery there – they treat people like animals,” he said.', 'The widespread abuse of migrants in Libya, above all of people from sub-Saharan Africa, goes back at least two decades: in 2005, an Italian parliamentary commission heard that people were being locked up “like dogs” in detention centres built by Gaddafi, partly as a result of requests from European governments to limit migration to their shores. Gaddafi is gone, but there is still a well-documented overlap between smugglers and officials in what remains of the Libyan state.', 'As Maria Serrano, a migration researcher for Amnesty, put it to me: “NGOs don’t only save lives at sea, they monitor what is happening, and what the Iuventa and others were doing was bearing witness to the awful violations in Libya by trying to assist the survivors.”', 'In June 2018, Italian prosecutors officially named 10 Iuventa crew members as suspects. In an attempt to clear their name, the volunteers commissioned an investigation by the London-based researchers Forensic Architecture. Using geolocation techniques, and the Iuventa’s own archive of pictures and video footage, Forensic Architecture discovered what they say are serious discrepancies in the case file. In one instance, from June 2017, Italian authorities say an empty dinghy was being towed by Iuventa crew members back towards Libya. But analysis of video footage shot from another rescue ship, along with wind patterns, suggests that it was being towed in the opposite direction, the crew say in order to be destroyed. In another, from the same day, footage examined by Forensic Architecture suggests that two men seen watching a rescue take place from a distance are “engine fishers” – people who follow migrant boats in order to salvage the parts – rather than smugglers, as the authorities claim.', 'By this time, NGO rescuers had almost completely vanished from the central Mediterranean. Once in his post as interior minister, Salvini engineered a series of standoffs in which he prevented rescue ships from docking in Italy, leaving vessels with hundreds of migrants on board trapped at sea for days. “These jackals put the lives of immigrants at risk,” Salvini tweeted during one such episode. “Will they also go unpunished?” Now back in opposition, after his governing coalition collapsed last year, Salvini is facing a possible criminal trial of his own. This February, the Italian senate voted to strip him of parliamentary immunity and allow magistrates in Sicily to try him for kidnapping, over an incident in which he prevented 131 migrants from disembarking.', 'According to Matteo Villa, a migration researcher at the Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI), a leading Italian thinktank, Salvini’s actions may have been extreme, but he was “expressing the sentiments of all EU governments at the time”. An internal report by the EU border agency Frontex, leaked to the media in December 2016, stated that NGO rescuers acted as an unwitting “pull factor” on migration across the Mediterranean sea.', 'Yet Villa’s own research suggests this is a mistaken premise. A recent study of migration patterns from Libya between 2014 and 2019, co-authored with Eugenio Cusumano and published by the European University Institute, found “no relationship between the presence of NGOs at sea and the number of migrants leaving Libyan shores”. Instead, departures rose or fell with the weather, or due to political conditions in Libya itself. But in the absence of larger-scale rescue operations, the proportion of people who die has increased. Even though the number of crossings has fallen drastically, still 750 people drowned or went missing last year.', 'When I spoke to Malik and Abdulrahman, it was almost four years since they had encountered the Iuventa. Abdulrahman now lives in Germany, where his claim for asylum was granted, and is doing an engineering apprenticeship. “I was very angry to hear that the people who saved our lives are now having problems,” he told me. Malik, meanwhile, is living in a reception centre near Naples, still waiting for a decision on his asylum claim. “I knew what was happening in the Mediterranean and I made a gamble out of it,” he said. Abdulrahman and Malik’s fortunes had diverged – but they were both alive.', 'Last year, Pietro Gallo, the security guard whose actions helped trigger the surveillance of the Iuventa, broke his silence about the affair. “I never witnessed the NGOs collaborating with traffickers,” he told a reporter from the German newspaper Die Zeit. “That was always just a hunch. We put two and two together.” Gallo claimed he hadn’t intended for rescuers to be forced out of the Mediterranean, only that he thought Salvini would use his position “to work out a humanitarian solution on a European level”.', 'In late 2019, a resolution calling for the EU to improve its search-and-rescue operations was narrowly defeated in the European parliament by an alliance of far-right and conservative parties. Ursula von der Leyen, the centre-right president of the European commission – the EU’s executive branch – has promised a “human and humane” approach in the commission’s new migration pact, a document that will set the course of policy over the next few years. But Von der Leyen began her tenure last year by renaming her head of migration “commissioner for protecting the European way of life”, wording that was condemned for its resemblance to far-right propaganda, and quickly changed.', 'At the EU’s land and sea borders, reports describe the violent expulsion of refugees and other vulnerable migrants: this summer, Greece was accused of setting people adrift in the Aegean, while Italy and Malta have both tried to close their ports to rescued migrants, citing the coronavirus pandemic. It’s the migrants who most often get caught at the sharp end, but as governments toughen their border policies, volunteers who step in to help can find themselves treated as criminals. A recent report by Amnesty International found that since 2015, more than 150 people have been investigated or prosecuted in Europe for offering help to migrants.', 'In Italy, since the spring of 2017, 16 separate criminal investigations have been opened into NGO rescue ships. Today, the handful of NGOs that still operate face long battles with the authorities to be allowed into port, and their vessels are still sometimes impounded: on 21 September, a ship belonging to the German NGO Sea-Watch was held in the port of Palermo, for issues including “having too many lifejackets on board”, the fifth time a rescue vessel has been seized.', 'Yet none of the criminal cases have so far come to trial – even though, in the case of the Iuventa, which is now the longest-running active investigation, it has been more than three years since the ship was seized. Prosecutors have yet to decide whether they will bring charges, pending the result of a forensic search of the crew’s computers and phones. In the meantime, the Iuventa 10 are patiently trying to clear their name – and get their ship back.', '“We never thought we were a solution to the problem,” Girke told me when I spoke to him earlier this year. “The question for us was: how can we empower people on the move to resist, to end their own suffering?

The demonstrators are calling on the government to instead invest in expanding rail transport infrastructure.', 'As forestry workers began to fell the first trees on Thursday to make way for the motorway, police destroyed barricades, treehouses and makeshift platforms built by activists, who have been occupying parts of the forest for the last year.', 'On Friday, police said they had made 16 arrests in the adjacent Herrenwald where the clearing began, including 10 activists who had to be pulled down from treetops via hoisting platforms. In a video posted on social media, masked activists conceded that “we have sadly failed to stop the clearing, because there were too few of us”.', 'But protests have since proliferated, with activists temporarily occupying the Hessian state representation’s offices in Berlin on Friday, and about 300 cyclists closing down a section of the south-bound lane of the A49 on Saturday.', 'Organisers said about 5,000 people travelled to the forest on Sunday morning to protest against the motorway plans and to take part in “guided nature walks” through the threatened woodland.

That is how Janet Alty will always remember one of the most successful environment campaigns of modern times: the movement to ban lead in petrol.', 'There were the leaflets she wrote to warn parents at school gates of the dangers, leaflets to persuade voters and politicians, leaflets to drown out the industry voices saying – falsely – there was nothing to worry about.', 'In the late 1970s, the UK was still poisoning the air with the deadly toxin, despite clear scientific evidence that breathing in lead-tainted air from car exhausts had an effect on development and intelligence. Recently returned from several years in the US, Alty was appalled. Lead had been phased out in the US from 1975. Why was the British government still subjecting children to clear harm?', 'Robin Russell-Jones asked the same question. A junior doctor, he quickly grasped the nature of the lead problem, moving his family out of London. His fellow campaigner, Robert Stephens, amassed a trove of thousands of scientific papers, keeping them in his garage when his office burned down – he suspected foul play.', 'Their campaign took years. But in 1983, a damning verdict from the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution prompted the UK government to decree that both petrol stations and manufacturers must offer lead-free alternatives. Leaded petrol was finally removed from the last petrol pumps in the UK in 1999.', 'Today, it seems incredible that lead was ever used as a performance improver in car engines. Clean alternatives were available by the 1970s, but making the transition incurred short-term costs, so the motor industry, led by chemicals companies, clung on, lobbying politicians and ridiculing activists.', 'Faced with multiplying, and interlinked, environmental crises in the 2020s – the climate emergency, the sixth extinction stalking the natural world, the plastic scourge in our oceans, the polluted air of teeming metropolises – it is easy to feel overwhelmed. Lockdown offered a tantalising glimpse of a cleaner world, but also revealed a starker truth: that the global economy is not set up to prioritise wellbeing, climate and nature. What can we do, in the face of these devastating odds?', 'It is easy to forget that environmentalism is arguably the most successful citizens’ mass movement there has been. Working sometimes globally, at other times staying intensely local, activists have transformed the modern world in ways we now take for granted. The ozone hole has shrunk. Whales, if not saved, at least enjoy a moratorium on hunting. Acid rain is no longer the scourge of forests and lakes. Rivers thick with pollution in the 1960s teem with fish. Who remembers that less than 30 years ago, nuclear tests were still taking place in the Pacific? Greenpeace’s Rainbow Warrior ship was blown up by the French government in 1985, with one death and many injuries, in a long-running protest.', 'As well as giving heart to activists now, these victories contain important lessons. “The environmental movement has been very successful,” says Joanna Watson, who has worked at Friends of the Earth for three decades. “We’ve had so many campaigns and wins. Sometimes it’s been hard to claim success, and sometimes it takes a long time. And sometimes things that worked before won’t work now. But there’s a lot we can learn.”', 'Acid rain, first identified in the 1850s, took decades to address. The first murmurings of concern came about after the second world war and there were concerted efforts to solve it in the 1960s. But it is the campaign that Nat Keohane, vice-president at the Environmental Defense Fund and a former lecturer at Yale, points to when he wants to invoke the success of the global environmental movement. “The reason I talk about acid rain is that it’s one of the instances where we solved the problem.”', 'Acid rain occurs when sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides react with moist air to form weak acids, which then fall from clouds, killing plants and aquatic life. The scars can still be seen in parts of the US and northern Europe, where acid has etched limestone building facades, and faces have dissolved from statues. But in most of the world – except China, where the problem persists – the lifeless lakes and leafless trees that acid rain created have long since revived.', '“Environmental groups led a drumbeat of campaigning on acid rain throughout the 1980s,” says Keohane.', 'Public pressure in the worst-offending countries – chiefly the US and the UK, which were responsible for acid rain that fell largely on neighbouring countries such as Canada and Scandinavia – was key. Watson recalls one telling advertising campaign: posters printed on litmus paper that said: “When acid rain is falling, you should see red” – offering a vivid illustration of the problem.', 'Getting businesses onside was a different matter. In the US, that was achieved through a novel mechanism that offered financial incentives from rivals, rather than the public purse. “It was the first successful demonstration of a market-based approach,” says Keohane. US power plant operators were issued with a limited number of allowances for how much sulphur and nitrogen oxides they could emit. They could buy and sell these among themselves, meaning the dirtiest companies had to buy them from those who cleaned up fastest, while the number of allowances available was gradually reduced. This cap-and-trade system operated successfully from 1990, becoming the model for a similar approach to greenhouse gases under the 1997 Kyoto protocol – though that attempt was less successful, because the US rejected it.', '', 'Net-zero carbon\xa0or\xa0carbon neutrality\xa0mean that the emissions of an entity (such as a country, region or company) are balanced by the amount of carbon dioxide it is taking out of the atmosphere, through absorption (eg trees) or removal (ie carbon\xa0capture and storage, see below)', 'Carbon removal\xa0is the process of taking carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases out of the air chemically or mechanically. This can be done at source, by capturing and containing carbon dioxide or other gases physically, or by\xa0“scrubbing”, a chemical process applied to waste gases that flow or are pushed through a filter that react with the gases to change them to less harmful forms. It can also be achieved, usually less efficiently, by scrubbing carbon from ambient air. There are various methods of doing this, most involving passing air over chemical filters, but at its simplest carbon removal can take the form of crushing rocks such as basalt that then absorb carbon naturally from the air, a process known as enhanced weathering. These crushed rocks can be added to soil, which can also improve the fertility of poor soils, but the energy used to crush the rocks must also be taken into account.', 'Carbon capture and storage (CCS)\xa0is a means of carbon removal that requires diverting carbon dioxide emissions from their source, usually a power station or industrial facility, and compressing the gas to a liquid for long-term storage, usually in a depleted oil well or other natural geological storage site. CCS technology has progressed over the past two decades but is still expensive and energy-intensive.', 'Carbon offsetting\xa0is the practice of reaching carbon neutrality through investing in projects that reduce CO2 emissions. There are as many forms of offsetting as there are ways of using energy. Carbon sinks such as forests and peatlands can be protected or expanded to offset carbon emissions from other sources. Tree-planting, for instance, is a common offsetting practice. Carbon offsetting has been sometimes controversial in the past two decades, as it has been subject to scams and frauds, and because some organisations have been accused of using offsetting as a cheap alternative to more difficult choices involved in reducing their emissions. For these reasons, it is important that offsetting measures are clearly set out and subject to independent verification.', '“The benefits were 40 times greater than the costs,” says Keohane. “There was an 86% reduction in pollutants, from 1990 to 2015, and there were huge unappreciated benefits beyond acid rain, on cleaning up particulates [an especially harmful form of air pollution].”', 'What acid rain showed is that businesses can be successfully regulated, without causing economic damage, says Keohane. As with the campaign against lead, companies resisted new rules for years, but when they came, they responded swiftly, showing governments they could afford to be less timid.', 'There are also lessons for today’s campaigners in the close shaves. Climate change threatens to melt the ice caps, raise sea levels, destroy agriculture over swaths of the world, and is already causing humanitarian disasters. Time is short. But a lesson from 40 years ago shows the world can move quickly and decisively if it has to.', 'About 15-35km above the surface of the Earth, the ozone layer acts as a filter against the sun’s radiation, blocking about 97% to 99% of medium-frequency ultraviolet light. That is important, because over-exposure to ultraviolet radiation is harmful to most living things, including plants and animals, and causes skin cancers, eye problems and genetic damage in humans.', 'In 1974 came the first indications that all was not well in the lower stratosphere. Research by Mario Molina, who died last week, and F Sherwood Rowland, both later awarded Nobel prizes, found that chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), commonly used as propellants in aerosols, were likely to be reacting with the ozone and depleting it.', 'The first moves against CFCs were in the US, Canada, Sweden and a few other countries in 1978, but others hung back, as chemical companies dismissed the fears as theoretical. Then, in 1985, the British Antarctic Survey published clear evidence of damage, in the form of a patch of drastically thinned ozone across the south pole. Their measurements showed 40% less ozone than had been detected 20 years earlier. The science was indisputable.', 'The world moved quickly. Governments got together under the aegis of the UN and forged the Montreal Protocol in 1987, which phased out ozone-depleting chemicals globally. “The Montreal protocol is the best environment treaty the world has ever created,” says Durwood Zaelke, the president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development. “It solved the first great threat to the atmosphere, and put the ozone layer on the path to recovery by 2065. There’s very strong empirical evidence that it has done its job.”', 'When the Montreal protocol was signed, the world was rapidly approaching a precipice. The further the ozone depleted, the less likely it was to regenerate naturally. If the damage continued beyond a certain point, recovery and natural repair would have become virtually impossible, even if production of the harmful chemicals ceased. “It would have been beyond repair in about five or 10 years if we had not acted,” says Paul Bledsoe, a strategic adviser at the Progressive Policy Institute thinktank in Washington DC.', 'The Montreal protocol shows, as the response to Covid-19 demonstrated, that the world can move quickly when governments want to.', '“If a government needs to act, and Covid has shown this, my God can a government act,” says John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK. “All of a sudden, no regulation, no amount of money is a problem. When we need to act, we can.”', 'A key factor in the Montreal protocol and its preceding successes was making the economic case for action. When it came to ozone-depleting chemicals, the chemical companies found they could manufacture substitutes – and make more money doing so. Car companies made a similar calculation on lead in petrol, and US power plants had the incentives of cap-and-trade to halt acid rain. Today, a comparable economic shift has already happened in the field of climate action: renewable energy is cheaper in many countries than coal, gas and oil, and costs are likely to fall further.', 'But some companies with fossil fuels to sell will still be left stranded, and corporate vested interests have not gone away. Russell-Jones recalls that Associated Octel, the UK’s main lead producer, “went apoplectic” when he started touring radio studios in the early 1980s, sending an operative to trail him in a car, following him in to demand right of reply on the same programme he had just appeared on. These days, there is no need for such efforts as internet trolls can reach far more people.', '“Fake news is everywhere,” he says. “Disinformation from rightwing thinktanks, on air pollution and climate change, is all over the internet. And the media landscape has shifted to the right.”', 'One of the most striking aspects of successful environmental campaigns of the past is how they straddled the left-right political divide. Key green legislation and decisions, including the Montreal protocol and the 1992 UN framework convention on climate change, the parent treaty to the Paris agreement, were put forward and signed by leaders from across the political spectrum.', 'This may be partly because world leaders in the past were more willing to listen to scientists than today. “[The UK prime minister, Margaret] Thatcher got it, on the ozone layer – she was a chemist, she read all the scientific papers herself,” says Zaelke. “[Ronald] Reagan got it because he’d had skin cancer.”', 'But a changing political discourse in many countries, driven by a rightwing populism that has forsaken reality in favour of stoking imagined grievances, has created a harsher political environment, according to Bledsoe. “The opponents [of climate action] have learned that in a culture where people get their news from politically dominated outlets [and the internet], they can get away with lying about almost anything.” But he says there is one bright spot: “Younger people are rejecting these lies about climate change.”', 'In building a consensus that can transcend political divisions, Keohane believes green campaigners must focus on the outcome rather than the process and bring forward constructive ideas. “People get used to thinking about the fight, not the winning.” he says. “We have to remind ourselves that we have done it and we can do it again.”', 'Reaching out across divisions to foster a broad and inclusive sense of community is essential. Alty may have spent seemingly endless hours printing and handing out leaflets, but “I never felt lonely, not once,” she says, and the many positive responses from people she encountered kept her going. “It was very labour-intensive, it was like rolling a heavy boulder up a very steep hill.

The UN’s environment chief said “nature is sending us a message” that our abuse of the planet had consequences.', 'As critical as it is to tackle the damage caused by Covid-19, the root cause – the invasion of wild places and the exploitation of wild animals – is not being addressed, experts warned in the Guardian, despite the relatively tiny amount it would cost. Without action, even worse pandemics would happen, top scientists warned.', 'The cascade of pandemic impacts is also hitting food supplies in vulnerable places, with the Guardian highlighting fears of the worst food crisis in 50 years and a “famine of biblical proportions”. We also revealed how meat processing plants had become hotspots of Covid-19 infections among workers: “Everyone’s on top of you, sneezing and coughing,” one person told us.', 'While a temporary reduction in air pollution was a rare benefit of the pandemic, long-term exposure to dirty air appears to drive up Covid infections and deaths. The Guardian revealed the latest research, including a striking study providing compelling evidence of a link, as well as the discovery of the virus on pollution particle samples. Poor quality air might also help explain the disproportionate impact of Covid on minority ethnic communities, we revealed.', 'The coronavirus crisis is also an opportunity, however, with trillions of dollars being deployed to fund the recovery.

The conclusion: few want a return to “normal”.', 'That normal would mean the relentless rise of global heating, with the brief cut in emissions during lockdown no more than a blip. Nowhere is that heating more obvious than in the oceans.

However, trade union objections forced a U-turn on the policy after barely a week. \n  The government has now said it would be up to individual workplaces to decide whether or not to introduce meat-free days. \n  Denmark had been attempting to make reductions in the nation’s diet-related footprint to help meet its ambitious new climate targets. Last year it approved a new climate law to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 70% by 2030.', 'As well as the meat-free days, Denmark had been planning to introduce climate-friendly dietary guidelines in 2021 and initiatives to help reduce emissions from the farming sector. \n  The Danish government had not wanted to ban meat consumption, said Anne Paulin, climate spokesperson for the ruling Social Democrats, but to “set an example on greener eating habits”. Paulin said a more “pragmatic solution” of voluntary meat-free days had now been agreed. “We still believe people will eat meat in the future, but we should eat less for climate and health reasons,” she added.\n  Experts had said the meat-free days, even if compulsory, would be unlikely to reduce climate emissions given the size of the livestock sector in the country. Denmark produces vastly more pig meat than the country needs; 90% of all its pork production is exported, mostly to the rest of Europe.', '“Changing diet will probably not reduce Denmark’s emissions greatly. Our agricultural sector supplies a global market and I do not see them producing less because they sell less in Denmark,” said Katherine Richardson, leader of the sustainability science centre at the University of Copenhagen.', 'Paulin said the government had “no specific policy to minimise the Danish livestock capacity”, adding that the country’s producers were very climate-efficient compared with other European countries.\n Greenpeace said the government’s U-turn on meat-free days was “embarrassing” and that it was now also likely to back away from initiating the necessary transition in Danish agriculture. \n “It needs to start talking about the elephant in the room, the fact that Denmark is the biggest meat producer in the world, per capita, with 28% of Danish climate emissions coming from the production of meat and dairy products,” said Helene Hagel, head of climate and environmental policy at Greenpeace Denmark.\n The Danish food industry said the meat-free proposals were “not necessarily beneficial” in reducing climate emissions.', '“Our major concern about mandatory meat-free days from a purely climate perspective is that Danish food products which are among the most climate efficient in the world will be substituted with products flown in from abroad. That will make absolutely no sense from a climate perspective and would render the initiative a token effort,” said Niels Peter Nørring, climate director at the Danish Agriculture and Food Council. \n  UK Green party MP Caroline Lucas said meat-free campaigns were a great way of introducing people to plant-based dishes and raising awareness of the environmental impact of industrialised livestock rearing. “It’s not saying ‘no to meat-eating’, it’s focusing on less and better and – if done in consultation with people – has the potential to change eating habits long term.” Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

He became a fisherman in the Tuscan village of Talamone at 13 and still plies the waters at the age of 60 in his small boat, the Sirena. But in the past decade, his job has become harder, as trawling near the coast has been destroying the marine ecosystem.', 'The impact is devastating. “The nets are weighed down with heavy chains to be dragged on the sea bottom, so they uproot all the posidonia, the seagrass that is key to the Mediterranean ecosystem because sea bream, lobsters and red gurnards lay their eggs there,” he says.', '“They don’t care. Nobody is watching,” he adds. “It’s like if a hunter burned a whole forest to catch a hare.”', 'While Italian law bans trawling within three nautical miles of the coast, it’s so profitable that it’s not uncommon for boats to carry on illegally at night. Some employ lookouts to warn against the coast guard, or use devices to shield their GPS signal.', 'Fanciulli noticed the effects of trawling as early as the 1980s: the damaged ecosystem was affecting his catch and having an impact on his livelihood. So, along with some other local fishermen and activists from Greenpeace, he blocked a commercial port in Tuscany in protest.', 'It was the beginning of a struggle that has made him something of a local celebrity. Fanciulli has destroyed trawling nets with barbed wire. He once stopped a trawler by pretending to be the police. His activism has seen him interviewed on German and Chinese TV, and people in Talamone regularly stop “Paolo il Pescatore” – Paolo the Fisherman – to inquire about his newborn son.', 'It also earned him enemies, he says: threats from local mafia soon made it impossible for him to sell his fish at the market.', 'He turned instead to what he describes as “pascaturismo”, or fishing tourism: he takes visitors out on his boat, giving them a chance to catch fish and learn about the ecological threat of trawling. He also runs a small restaurant at weekends, and sells his catch to the Gruppi di Acquisto Solidale, a collective of Italian families buying ethical products.', 'It wasn’t enough to stop illegal fishing, however. In 2006, a desperate Tuscan government dropped concrete blocks into the sea in an effort to disrupt the trawlers. Fanciulli says they didn’t work, however, as they were too far apart and the nets simply dragged between them.', 'He got permission from Arpa, the agency for environmental protection, to drop an additional 80 blocks at his own expense. Still, however, he wasn’t satisfied, and his thoughts turned to the shipwrecks he’d loved as a boy. “I didn’t just want concrete,” he says. “I was fascinated with beautiful antiquities underwater.”', 'He began to wonder: what if, instead of dropping concrete blocks into the water, he dropped art?', 'He asked a quarry in nearby Carrara if they could donate two marble blocks that he could use to make sculptures. “They donated 100 instead.”', 'Via word of mouth, contributions from tourists and online crowdfunding, Fanciulli persuaded artists including Giorgio Butini, Massimo Lippi, Beverly Pepper and Emily Young to carve sculptures from the marble. Then he took them out to sea and lowered them in.', 'The underwater sculptures create both a physical barrier for nets and a unique underwater museum. The sculptures are placed in a circle, 4m apart, with an obelix at the centre carved by the Italian artist Massimo Catalani. Emily Young provided four sculptures, each weighing 12 tons, she calls “guardians”; nearby lies a mermaid by the young artist Aurora Vantaggiato. Lippi has contributed 17 sculptures representing Siena’s contrade, or medieval districts.', 'The “museum” is open to anyone who can arrange a visit – either through guided scuba tours or by arranging their own dive.', 'It’s located along the Argentario section of the Tuscan coast, which has been plagued by trawling, and this year boats have been caught carrying illegal nets and fishing in protected waters.', 'Biologist Roberto Danovaro, who heads the Anton Dohrn research institute in Naples, likened trawling to “fishing with bombs”. “You catch the fish, but also destroy their habitat,” he says. “With no possibility of growing back because trawling is so intense.”', 'But the museum appears to be having some effect. Whereas 10 years ago the Posidonia was disappearing, Dr Gioia Benedettini, sea manager of Arpat, the local environmental agency, says it is now growing back.', 'The statues also deserve credit for helping to preserve the fishing industry, she says: they “protect the fish resources because the nursery areas of various commercial fish species are located below the coast”.', 'Marine life of all kinds appears to be returning. Algae covers the statues, and lobsters have taken up residence nearby. Talamone is a turtle recovery centre – part of the Tartalife project – and more turtles have been seen, as have dolphins. “In the past it was unusual to see dolphins near the coast,” Faniculli says. “They normally stay offshore, but as industrial fishing destroyed the seabed, they moved close to the statues because, due the repopulation, there is food.”', 'The museum is Fanciulli’s version of the shipwrecks he loved as a boy, and he hopes to build on its success. “We put in the first statues in 2007 but our goal is to reach 100,” he says, sensing an opportunity. “We’d like someone to help our battle in defence of the sea.

Turned out that our family, work and activism backgrounds were heterogeneous, but there was something in common: for each traveller in that fast-moving sedan the music of Midnight Oil had been a formative part of our political activation.', 'I found myself drifting off, thinking of road trips 30 years earlier. There were other great bands and sounds, of course, but the Oils were singular. At times we seemed to listen to Midnight Oil almost on loop, played on cassettes that wore out in beaten-up old cars. The question wasn’t what band, but would we start with Red Sails or Blue Sky? The music was like something elemental, intrinsic to the temper of the time for that generational cohort to which I belonged – emerging in the greedy, scary, last decade of the cold war, and the wasted locust years of the 90s.', 'It was first announced in October, but this week Midnight Oil will be formally awarded the Sydney Peace Foundation’s gold medal for human rights. The prize is deeply deserved for more than four decades of musician-activism and for all that the band has inspired in others. In typical fashion there’s no doubt the Oils will use the platform to advocate as allies of the Uluru Statement of the Heart as they have on their most recent release, The Makarrata Project.', 'The span of issues covered by the Oils was as comprehensive as a manifesto: urban alienation, nuclear disarmament, workers’ rights, Indigenous land justice, the commodification of life, imperialism, refugees, vested interests capturing democracy – and of course the environment and climate change.', 'The tone shifted from song to song, from the didactic to the allegorical or satirical and the furious to the contemplative. But the compass always swung towards a true north of hope through action; of the ability of people to hold power to account and the transcendent beauty of the earth and sea and sky. Deep commitment to social justice and a sense of the spiritual were evoked with intense feeling but without dogma. And it just sounded fantastic: the lead vocals of Peter Garrett, the velocity of Rob Hirst’s drumming, the singing guitars of Martin Rotsey and Jim Moginie; the underlying drive of the bassists, first Peter Gifford, and then the late and great Bones Hillman – taken by cancer earlier this month.', 'For young men in particular, the Oils offered a species of masculinity in deep contrast to the macho blokeyness of traditional Australian gender roles. Testosterone, it seemed, could be put to decent ends and peaceful pursuits. The only thing to be shot was the wave. The passion never became aggression, and power was not for domination. The band didn’t tolerate any aggro at Midnight Oil shows, not from within the crowd – nor by overzealous security.', 'The materiality of the continent was evoked in tracks of surf and desert, cities of concrete and neat-lawned suburbs. And the songs were imbued with deep historical consciousness. The Oils lyrically acknowledged the truth of prior Indigenous ownership from time immemorial and the pain of invasion long before these things became common fare among whitefellas. But other history was there to ensure no forgotten years of foreign wars or short memories of global imperialism.', 'The nation became a grand thing in the Midnight Oil imaginary, deserving of epic songs of gun barrel highways and bones bleaching white – capable of simultaneously realising justice and potential. The insistence that the great south land could be as great as the one it could have been not only problematised Australia’s past and present but also offered an immensely hopeful idea of the national future. And there was nothing elitist about the project because Oils songs are full of people and the immanent features of daily life: the part-time cleaner in a holiday flat; the worker from the blue-sky mine; people who live in water tanks and those who live in red-brick flats.', 'Midnight Oil has a long association with Greenpeace. Back in the mid-80s Garrett sometimes introduced the iconic track Hercules as an “ode to the Rainbow Warrior”. When the Oils re-formed in 2017, they played a private warm-up gig for 250 activists, environmentalists and friends in Greenpeace’s Sydney warehouse before the world tour kicked off (the gig is mentioned for posterity in the sleeve notes to the Armistice Day live album). I remember an odd sense that night, almost a mythic feel to things. In days of climate emergency, with a national government sunk in a morass of capture by fossil-fuel-vested interests, they’d returned. The Oils were back. And three years later here they are, back at number one on the Australian music charts.', 'The songs of Midnight Oil never shy away from loss and grief, both personal and political. That honest bearing of loss is fundamental to an emotional reckoning with these breaking years of extreme climate damage. But there’s no defeatism or abandonment in any Oils track.', 'When you read the Oils song-sheet, the ethic of determination, onwards, whatever the odds, is a golden thread. Not much time, but time to try. They say it’s late, but you know it’s never too late. Sometimes you’re shaken to the core, but you don’t give in.', 'David Ritter is the chief executive of Greenpeace Australia Pacific']",[],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e0862dcc94f5fcaa487a6b6d95a4a075b659973/119_79_1853_1112/master/1853.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'Midnight Oil']]",

He warned that “global warming may reach such a level that rivers will dry” and that “eventually Tibet will become like Afghanistan”, with terrible consequences for at least a billion people dependent on water from the plateau “at the roof of the world”.', 'The 85-year-old Nobel peace laureate is considered by his followers to be the earthly manifestation of an enlightened one who has chosen rebirth in order to help liberate all living beings from suffering through compassion.', 'Lhamo Thondup, as he was named at birth, was discovered as the latest incarnation of the Dalai Lama when he was just two years old. He uses Zoom to communicate with people around the globe these days, unable to travel or invite visitors because of the coronavirus pandemic.', 'He insists, as he announced in 2011, that he is retired from politics and his leadership of the struggles for Tibetan freedom from China, and that ecology is now the thing that is “very, very important” to him.', 'In the week the Cop26 UN climate conference was to have been held in Glasgow, he says has high expectations of world leaders, and wants them to act on the Paris climate agreement.', '“The United Nations should take a more active role in this field,” he says. Asked whether world leaders are failing, he says: “The big nations should pay more attention to ecology. I hope you see those big nations who spent a lot of money for weapons or war turn their resources to the preservation of the climate.”', 'The Dalai Lama says that if he joined a political party now, “I would like to join the Green party. Their idea is very good.”', 'The Dalai Lama has been known to put his foot in it with inadvertent enthusiasm, such as when he said it was possible he could be succeeded by a woman, but that she should be “very, very attractive”. He later made clear that he had meant no offence and said he was deeply sorry that people had been hurt by his words.', 'His suggestion for how to make world leaders see sense on climate change may also raise eyebrows, but again seems to be the product of a lively 85-year-old sense of humour. The Dalai Lama chuckles as he suggests we should lock them all in a room and “pipe carbon dioxide into it until they realise what climate change really means”. He explains that “people who have a certain luxury sort of style of life in a room without proper oxygen” would realise “it is very difficult”.', 'The Dalai Lama says he is in favour of large-scale tree planting to help tackle climate change. He also believes meat consumption worldwide should fall dramatically, but explains that since his own decision to go vegetarian in 1965, health problems have led doctors to advise him to resume eating a little meat.', 'He says his greatest personal contribution to fighting climate change is education and promoting the concept of compassion. The Dalai Lama is most passionate when talking about his idea of oneness among 7 billion people. “We see too much emphasis on my nation, my religion, their religion. That really is causing all these problems due to different religions and different nations are fighting. So now we really need oneness.” He even says he can now live as one with China, which he claims is “the biggest Buddhist population now”.', 'Nearing the end of this life, the Dalai Lama has not publicly explained how his reincarnation should be sought, or whether a 15th Dalai Lama should be found at all. He jokes that in his next life “I may be born on the Moon or Mars. Then I will starve.”', 'In the past he has raised the idea of being the last in the line of Dalai Lamas, perhaps to prevent China naming a politically cooperative successor. For now, he says he wants to leave that decision to others. “As long as I live I should be useful to help other people. Then after that, not my business. These are the concerns of other people.”', 'His advice for the rest of us living through the coronavirus pandemic is similarly practical, crediting an unnamed Indian scholar with the idea that “If there’s a way to overcome [coronavirus], then no need to worry.

Decades later, while on a trip to the Arctic with Greenpeace, the gently comical sight of a flying puffin, which is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN red list, was a respite from the grief and trauma of watching glaciers disappear. “There always seems to be a think bubble above their heads as they’re flying, which is ‘I’m not sure how long I’m going to be able to keep this up!’ because their wings go so fast,” she told the Guardian.', 'The sixth mass extinction in geological history has not only begun but is accelerating, according to some scientists, who warn that it may be a tipping point for the collapse of civilisation.', 'A report in June 2020 found more than 500 species of land animals were found to be on the brink of extinction and likely to be lost within 20 years. In comparison, the same number were lost over the whole of the last century.', 'The land vertebrates on the verge of extinction, with fewer than 1,000 individuals left, include the Sumatran rhino, the Clarión wren, the Española giant tortoise and the harlequin frog.', 'The analysis, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, examined data on 29,400 land vertebrate species compiled by the IUCN red list of threatened species and BirdLife International. The researchers identified 515 species with populations below 1,000 and about half of these had fewer than 250 remaining. Most of these mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians were found in tropical and subtropical regions.', 'Changes to the climate are reversible, even if that takes centuries or millennia, and conservation efforts can work. Since 1993, up to 48 bird and mammal extinctions have been prevented by conservation efforts. But once species become extinct, there is no going back.', 'Thompson hopes the event helps people to realise their deep links with other living things. “That innate connection is what will save us, and to speak of it poetically or amusingly or artistically in any way is merely to remind people of what they already know,” she said. “It’s just adding another voice to the great chorus that is rising from everywhere at the moment, voices saying we can’t go on destroying our landscape, our planet, the great numbers of other organisms or species with whom we share the planet.”', 'As a child, Thompson was a junior member of Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. When she was filming In the Name of the Father in 1991, people started talking about bottled water and how stupid it was. “Two decades later we’re going … ‘this is ridiculous – we’ve got more plastic in the oceans than fish?’ If something could go badly wrong in 30 years, it can also go seriously right in the next 10,” she said.', 'From Toronto, Atwood will be speaking about the endangered Tasmanian devil, a dog-like marsupial whose ferocity reminds her of climate activist Greta Thunberg. “I chose this creature because I have seen it in its habitat, I’ve followed its footprints across a beach in Tasmania, and I have watched it move through several threats and partial recoveries,” she told the Guardian.', 'For Atwood the penny dropped about climate issues in the 50s. Humanity had dodged a number of bullets – ozone depletion, acid rain, DDT pesticides, atomic bombs – and scientists who spotted early signs of global heating were mainly ignored. Now people are listening, she said, as shown by the rise of Extinction Rebellion. “What we have to think about … is do we want to be a species? Are we already a threatened species? Are we investing in our own extinction? That is the question … If no action is taken, we’re going to go over the cliff. It’s just a matter of time.”', 'Having lived through several periods of protest over the years, Atwood says this is the first time the protests have been about the climate, which is forcing politicians to face up to the problem. “There’s no point not having some hope.

He wrote a book called The Hungry Tide whose central character is a scientist interested in these beakless dolphins, which have bulging foreheads and look like they’re smiling.', 'An estimated million species are at risk of extinction and Ghosh hopes the remembrance day will highlight the horror of watching entire populations of creatures vanishing before our eyes. “All this stuff has just become naturalised – we become immune to the horror that’s unfolding around us,” he said. “And I think it’s very important and very necessary to constantly reiterate that this isn’t normal.”', 'At this point, our choices are between terrible and catastrophic because we’ve already crossed too many planetary boundaries, he said. “We are heading towards catastrophic. So yes, we could turn it round to some degree so that we remain within some boundaries, that is still terrible, but are better than catastrophic.

The combination of minimal protection for the Cerrado – a globally important carbon sink and wildlife habitat – with an opaque supply chain and confusing labelling systems, means that shoppers may be inadvertently contributing to its destruction.', 'The broadcaster and campaigner Chris Packham said the revelations showed that consumers needed to be given more information about their food. “Most people would be incredulous when they think they’re buying a piece of chicken in Tesco’s which has been fed on a crop responsible for one of the largest wholesale tropical forest destructions in recent times,” he said.', '“We’ve got to wake up to the fact that what we buy in UK supermarkets, the implications of that purchase can be far and wide and enormously damaging, and this is a prime example of that.”', 'The UK slaughters at least a billion chickens a year, equivalent to 15 birds for every person in the country. Many are fattened up on soya beans imported into the UK by Cargill, which buys from farmers in the Cerrado, a woody tropical savanna that covers an area equal in size to Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain combined.', 'Analysis of shipping data shows that Cargill imported 1.5m tonnes of Brazilian soya to the UK in the six years to August 2020. Biome-level export figures, collated by the supply-chain watchdog Trase, indicate that nearly half of Cargill’s Brazilian exports to the UK are from the Cerrado.', 'Among the most recent shipments were 66,000 tonnes of soya beans that landed in Liverpool docks in August on a Cargill-leased bulk tanker, BBG Dream. This was the focus of a collaborative investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, Greenpeace Unearthed, ITV News, and the Guardian.', 'The ship’s hold had been loaded in Cotegipe port terminal in Salvador, Brazil, with beans that had come from the Cerrado’s Matopiba region, including some from Formosa do Rio Preto, the Cerrado’s most heavily deforested community. As well as Cargill, the suppliers included Bunge (Brazil’s biggest soya exporter) and ADM (another leading US food producer).', 'After crossing the Atlantic, the entire shipment was unloaded into Cargill’s Seaforth soya crush plant in Liverpool, according to maritime and shipping records. The investigation tracked the way that grain crushed there is then trucked to mills in Hereford and Banbury, where it is mixed with wheat and other ingredients to produce livestock feed. From there, it is taken to chicken farms contracted to Avara.', 'Avara is a joint venture between Cargill and Faccenda Foods. It fattens up birds, which are slaughtered, processed and packaged for distribution to Tesco, Asda, Lidl, Nando’s, McDonald’s and other retailers. Avara thrives in relative obscurity. “You might not have heard of us but there’s a good chance you’ve enjoyed our products,” the company’s website says.', 'Brazil’s Cerrado biome is a vast, tropical savannah stretching diagonally up through the middle of Brazil that covers 2 million sq km, around 22% of the country, as well as parts of Bolivia and Paraguay.', 'According to Brazil’s\xa0environment ministry, the biodiversity-rich Cerrado has 11,620 plant, 1,200 fish and 837 fish species and its 200 mammals include jaguars, anteaters, rhea birds and tapirs. But over half of its landscape – grassland scrub and dry forest – has been converted to agriculture as it produces soya for China, Europe and other markets. The region lost 105,000 square kilometres of native cover from 2008-2018, according to Reuters – 50% more than the Amazon, which has more legal protection.', 'According to an\xa0international study published by Science magazine, around 27,000 properties in the Cerrado had carried out deforestation “in all likelihood illegally”, and 48% of properties were non-compliant with the requirements of Brazil’s forest code, such as protecting 20% of their land (compared to 80% in the Amazon). The study found around 20% of soya exports and 17% of beef exports from Brazil’s Amazon and Cerrado biomes to the European Union “may be contaminated with illegal deforestation”.', 'Another study by researchers from Dartmouth College in the US, published in Nature Sustainability magazine, found land clearing had changed the weather in the Cerrado. Temperatures were hotter during the corn growing season and evapotranspiration fell.', 'In a 2019 article published in Perspectives in Ecology and Conservation, scientists warned that “climate changes are likely to cause local extinctions of several mammalian species throughout the Cerrado biome”.', 'Dom PhillipsThis explainer was written in 2020', 'So where, exactly, is this soya originating from? Avara’s supplier, Cargill, buys soya from many suppliers in the Cerrado, at least nine of which have been involved in recent land clearance. Analysis by the consultancy Aidenvironment of the land owned or used by these companies since 2015 found 801 sq km of deforestation – an area equivalent to 16 Manhattans. It also detected 12,397 recorded fires.', 'As recently as last month, drone footage taken in Formosa do Rio Preto showed huge fires burning on Fazenda Parceiro, a farm run by SLC Agrícola, which is a supplier to Cargill. Satellite data shows the fires burned 65 sq km of the farm. More than 210 sq km has been cleared on SLC Agrícola land over the past five years, according to the Aidenvironment analysis. Cargill said it broke no rules, nor their own policies, by sourcing from the farm in question and made clear it does not source from illegally deforested land. SLC Agrícola were approached for comment but declined.', 'Despite this destruction, produce from these areas can be labelled as legal and sustainable in Brazil. This highlights the shortcomings of an international trade system that relies on local standards, which are often influenced by farmers focused on short-term economic profit, rather than long-term global good, which would incorporate the value of water systems, carbon sinks and wildlife habitats.', 'The Brazilian government has steadily relaxed controls on deforestation – and sometimes tacitly encouraged it – over the past decade, most notably by the relaxation of the Forest Code in 2012.', 'This is particularly true in the Cerrado, Brazil’s second biggest biome, which is being sacrificed to boost exports, keep global food prices low and reduce the impact on its neighbour, the Amazon. Farmers can legally cut and burn a higher proportion of trees in this savannah compared with the internationally scrutinised Amazon.', 'Many biologists believe this policy is shortsighted. The trees, shrubs and soil of the Cerrado store the equivalent of 13.7bn tonnes of carbon dioxide – significantly more than China’s annual emissions. It is the origin of so many rivers it is known as “the birthplace of waters” and home to 1,600 species of birds, reptiles and mammals (including jaguars, armadillos and anteaters) and 10,000 types of plant, many not seen anywhere else in the world.', 'Scientists say it will be hard – if not impossible – to save Amazonia without conserving the Cerrado. But the latter has suffered double the deforestation even though it is half the size. Between 50% and 80% of the original biome has been replaced by cattle ranches and soya farms, making this the world’s most rapidly expanding agribusiness frontier and one of the fastest shrinking areas of nature.', 'Whether or not Brazil deems soya from this area legal, many consumers do not want to buy products associated with deforestation.', 'The UK imports 700,000 tonnes of raw soya beans each year, many from the Cerrado, It also buys almost three times this quantity of processed soya feed, the majority from Argentina. The environmental impact varies hugely from country to country. But shoppers have little way of knowing whether their chicken breast or burger contributed to the problem of the Cerrado because labels provide insufficient information about origins, crops from sustainable and deforested sources can be mixed, and many firms rely on offsets.', 'The companies involved say they are working to lower the environmental impact of their offerings, but progress varies.', 'McDonald’s and Nando’s cover the volumes of soya they uses for chicken feed with sustainability “certifications”, which includes purchasing “credits” – similar to carbon offsetting. The credits support farmers producing sustainably but the actual soya in the supply chain is not necessarily from these producers and can come from deforesting farms.', 'McDonald’s said it aimed to eliminate deforestation from its global supply chains by 2030. A spokesman said: “We’re proud of the progress we’ve made, yet recognise there is more to do, and will continue to work hard to progress toward our goals.”', 'Nando’s did not provide a target date to completely phase out deforestation from its supply chain, but it said it was looking at alternatives to soya. “We recognise that there is more work to do which is why we are also investing in research looking at more sustainable feed alternatives and look forward to being able to share the results as soon as possible.”', 'Asda and Lidl said they were working towards buying only “physically certified” sustainable soya by 2025, but this can mean different things. Asda takes it to mean “segregated” deforestation-free soya – meaning the actual product in its supply chain must be sustainable for it to meet its goal – but Lidl clarified it was including a scheme where sustainable grain can be mixed in with product from deforesting farms. Lidl said it is currently the largest buyer of credits to offset its soya footprint.', 'Tesco said that it has set itself an “industry-leading” target for its soya to come from verified deforestation-free “areas” by 2025. “Setting fires to clear land for crops must stop,” a spokesperson said. “We’ve played a leading role in convening industry and government to protect the Cerrado, including committing £10m to protect the region’s biodiversity. We need our suppliers, industry, NGOs and governments to work with us to end deforestation and protect our natural environment.”', 'Avara, Cargill’s joint venture, said it was at the forefront of the UK’s soya purchasers, covering all its soya purchases with certification, and working to achieve much higher transparency in the supply chain. “We welcome the UK government’s proposed legislation aimed at illegal deforestation as this is aligned with these objectives and an important first step.” Avara is part of the Statement of Support for the Cerrado Manifesto and sits on the steering group of this initiative.', 'McDonald’s, Nando’s and the three supermarkets named have publicly expressed their support for a new agreement, similar to the moratorium in the Amazon, to stop deforestation for soya in the Cerrado, but opposition in Brazil has meant nothing has materialised.', 'Cargill – one of the most important players in the supply chain – has publicly said it opposes a Cerrado moratorium. At the time, it announced $30m (£22.6m) in funding efforts to address deforestation but did not specify where this would be spent. The Guardian asked Cargill why it had rejected a moratorium, but the company did not comment on this.', 'It expressed its commitment to a deforestation-free supply chain, however, and to supporting farmers who are working sustainably. It said: “Cargill estimates that 95.68% of our soya volumes in Brazil for the 2018-19 crop year were deforestation- and conversion-free.” The company is continuing to expand its certification programme in Brazil and Paraguay, but put the emphasis on the Brazilian legal system. “Cargill – along with our industry, farmers, local governments and customers – has accountability for transforming the food supply chain, and we are engaging with stakeholders every day to make progress,” it said. “Deforestation in that biome is, in most cases, a criminal act by Brazilian law. It must be treated that way.”', 'The investigation shows, however, that merely treating it as a Brazilian matter is not enough.', 'Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

But while the EU focuses on emissions, the lithium gold rush threatens environmental damage on an industrial scale', 'Even before the new mine became the main topic of village conversation, João Cassote, a 44-year-old livestock farmer, was thinking about making a change. Living off the land in his mountainous part of northern Portugal was a grind. Of his close childhood friends, he was the only one who hadn’t gone overseas in search of work. So, in 2017, when he heard of a British company prospecting for lithium in the region of Trás-os-Montes, Cassote called his bank and asked for a €200,000 loan. He bought a John Deere tractor, an earthmover and a portable water-storage tank.', 'The exploration team of the UK-based mining company Savannah Resources had spent months poring over geological maps and surveys of the hills that ripple out from Cassote’s farm. Initial calculations indicated that they could contain more than 280,000 tonnes of lithium, a silver-white alkali metal – enough for 10 years’ production. Cassote got in touch with Savannah’s local office, and the mining firm duly contracted him to supply water to their test drilling site. The return on his investment was swift. After less than 12 months on the company’s books, Cassote had made what he would usually earn in five or six years on the farm.', 'Savannah is just one of several mining companies with an eye on the rich lithium deposits of central and northern Portugal. The sudden excitement surrounding petróleo branco (“white oil”) derives from an invention rarely seen in these parts: the electric car. Lithium is a key active material in the rechargeable batteries that run electric cars. It is found in rock and clay deposits as a solid mineral, as well as dissolved in brine. It is popular with battery manufacturers because, as the least dense metal, it stores a lot of energy for its weight.', 'Electrifying transport has become a top priority in the move to a lower-carbon future. In Europe, car travel accounts for around 12% of all the continent’s carbon emissions. To keep in line with the Paris agreement, emissions from cars and vans will need to drop by more than a third (37.5%) by 2030. The EU has set an ambitious goal of reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by the same date. To that end, Brussels and individual member states are pouring millions of euros into incentivising car owners to switch to electric. Some countries are going even further, proposing to ban sales of diesel and petrol vehicles in the near future (as early as 2025 in the case of Norway). If all goes to plan, European electric vehicle ownership could jump from around 2m today to 40m by 2030.', 'Lithium is key to this energy transition. Lithium-ion batteries are used to power electric cars, as well as to store grid-scale electricity. (They are also used in smartphones and laptops.) But Europe has a problem. At present, almost every ounce of battery-grade lithium is imported. More than half (55%) of global lithium production last year originated in just one country: Australia. Other principal suppliers, such as Chile (23%), China (10%) and Argentina (8%), are equally far-flung.', 'Lithium deposits have been discovered in Austria, Serbia and Finland, but it is in Portugal that Europe’s largest lithium hopes lie. The Portuguese government is preparing to offer licences for lithium mining to international companies in a bid to exploit its “white oil” reserves. Sourcing lithium in its own back yard not only offers Europe simpler logistics and lower prices, but fewer transport-related emissions. It also promises Europe security of supply – an issue given greater urgency by the coronavirus pandemic’s disruption of global trade.', 'Even before the pandemic, alarm was mounting about sourcing lithium. Dr Thea Riofrancos, a political economist at Providence College in Rhode Island, pointed to growing trade protectionism and the recent US-China trade spat. (And that was before the trade row between China and Australia.) Whatever worries EU policymakers might have had before the pandemic, she said, “now they must be a million times higher”.', 'The urgency in getting a lithium supply has unleashed a mining boom, and the race for “white oil” threatens to cause damage to the natural environment wherever it is found. But because they are helping to drive down emissions, the mining companies have EU environmental policy on their side.', '“There’s a fundamental question behind all this about the model of consumption and production that we now have, which is simply not sustainable,” said Riofrancos. “Everyone having an electric vehicle means an enormous amount of mining, refining and all the polluting activities that come with it.”', 'In the tiny hamlet of Muro in Trás-os-Montes, Cassote has concerns of his own. The prospecting phase ended earlier this year, and his expensive new machinery is standing idle in his farmyard. Savannah is waiting for the final green light from the Portuguese government for its lithium mine. If approved, the company is promising to invest $109m in the project. It will also create a quarry like an open wound in the mountainside. Cassote doesn’t mind. He just wants to be back on his earthmover.', 'Not everyone shares Cassote’s enthusiasm for lithium mining. After three decades living in Amsterdam, Mario Inacio, a 50-year-old professional dancer, recently returned to his home in Portugal with plans to build a yoga retreat deep in the countryside – somewhere bucolic and isolated where guests could wake to the sound of birdsong.', 'Inacio and his partner, Milko Prinsze, had identified the perfect spot, an abandoned farmstead set in 47 acres of grassy wilderness in central Portugal. The main house would require considerable renovation, but the rest was exactly as they had imagined. Driving down the sinuous, bumpy driveway for the first time, Inacio dreamed of the changes they could make – extending the house off to the side, converting the outhouses into private living quarters, carving out a natural pool in the rocks. He pinpointed the spot for the yoga studio: a small rise with expansive views over the grounds and out to the hills beyond.', 'Six years after the couple first set eyes on the place, Quinta Da Lua Nova is now ready to open its doors to paying guests. The global pandemic is creating a shortage of international clients and making it difficult to fill the nine rooms, but a much greater worry hangs over the business in which Inacio has invested his life savings. Moving to one of the large ground-floor windows of his new home, he pointed to the lush expanse of open country outside. “Any of this could be exploited for lithium soon. Possible exploration orders hang over all of it.”', 'In the past few years, small groups of anxious residents have come together across Portugal, concerned about the government’s lithium plans. With few facts in the public domain, these groups started making inquiries to local planning departments and town halls. In Inacio’s case, he said that he was told his requests would be “passed on”. He never heard any more.', 'At the same time, early-stage exploration works, led by the likes of Savannah and the Portugal-based Lusorecursos, were reportedly sighted across the country. An objector unearthed a technical assessment of Portugal’s lithium resources commissioned by the energy ministry in 2016. Eventually, a government spokesperson confirmed that discussions were under way with various mining companies, but said no firm decisions had yet been made.', 'Then, in January 2020, a map began circulating among the various WhatsApp and Facebook groups set up by concerned residents like Inacio. The map, put together by a local software developer specialising in cartography, appeared to confirm their worst fears. A tapestry of geometric shapes spread across the country’s interior, abutting designated nature reserves. A series of local and national protests, including a march in Lisbon last year, sought to raise awareness about the impacts of modern mining on the natural environment, including potential industrial-scale habitat destruction, chemical contamination and noise pollution, as well as high levels of water consumption. They also raised concerns about the impact on tourism – an economic mainstay for the country’s interior, with an annual turnover of €18.4bn in 2019.', 'All these concerns appear in a “national manifesto” recently published by a coalition of civic movements. Despite vociferous local media coverage, they have made little impact so far. In part, this reflects the relative weakness of the national environmental movement. Portugal is one of the few countries in Europe not to have a Greenpeace affiliate, for instance, and according to an EU survey, of all European consumers, the Portuguese are the least likely to pay more for eco-branded products.', 'For Maria Carmo, a 43-year-old university lecturer from the village of Barco, in the central district of Castelo Branco, such lack of engagement reveals the alienation that most urban or coastal-dwelling Portuguese feel towards the country’s rural heartlands. The trend in the past 50 years or so has been one of continued rural depopulation. Hundreds of thousands of people have left Portugal’s poor and already under-populated interior for new lives abroad or in the country’s coastal cities. Few of them return.', 'If a mining licence is granted in their region, Inacio and a small core of diehard supporters are prepared to fight it in the courts. Carmo is less sure. Her campaign group in Castelo Branco has already split, with half its members now open to the possibility of an open-pit lithium mine above her village. It will happen anyway, they say, so why not negotiate some guarantees? Barco used to have a tin mine, the villagers argue, and it wasn’t so bad.', 'But Carmo feels it’s a mistake to compare the two operations. Her own father and grandfather both worked in the Argemela tin mine outside the village before it closed in the early 1960s. Back then, mining was small-scale and subterranean. A new mine, in contrast, could see half the hill disappear, potentially damaging the remains of a bronze-age settlement on its peak. Villagers also fear that chemical runoff will pollute the nearby Zêzere river, which they depend on for their crops.', 'After a three-year struggle, Carmo is exhausted and ready to give in. She feels the government is deaf, and that her fellow citizens aren’t interested. “So much destruction,” she said. “And for what? So eco-minded urbanites in Paris and Berlin can feel good about driving around in zero-emission cars.”', 'Advocates of Portugal’s hoped-for lithium boom argue that local disruption is a small price to pay for tackling the climate crisis. They point out that innovations such as windfarms, solar energy parks and hydroelectric plants, while contributing to lowering CO2 emissions in the long term, all have some impact on local populations. In a note to investors, Savannah observes that its proposed mine (which boasts projected revenues of US$1.55bn over its initial 11-year lifespan) will contribute to enough battery packs to prevent the emission of 100m tonnes of carbon dioxide.', 'Savannah’s chief executive, David Archer, goes even further. Speaking from his London office, he pitched his firm’s multimillion-dollar investment as advancing the overall “quality of the global commons”. The equation he offers is simple: lithium equals batteries, which equals electric cars, which equals an end to transport emissions, which equals a world less vulnerable to today’s climate emergency. He adds the prospect of new jobs in the local area (up to 800 in Trás-os-Montes), higher tax revenues and a €437m boost to Portugal’s economy. From a development perspective, he said, it’s a “no-brainer”.', 'The Portuguese government concurs. In a promotional video targeted at foreign investors, the secretary of state for the environment named his country “one of the world’s leaders in energy transition”. The short film stresses the current government’s “strong commitment” to a policy of eco-innovation.', 'Objectors say that where there is profit to be made, local environmental impacts are almost always overlooked. The same dilemma has set back international climate talks for decades, said Harjeet Singh, global climate lead for the campaign group ActionAid. The global north wants stricter emissions targets; the global south wants economic development now, and reasonably feels that the burden of tackling the climate crisis should fall on the post-industrial societies primarily responsible for causing it. “Green technologies are essential for the transition to renewable energy,” Singh said, “but they are not without negative impacts [and] we need to ensure these don’t always fall on the poorest and most marginalised communities.”', 'In Chile, the battle over the impact of mining has been going on for years. Born and brought up in the copper-producing region of O’Higgins in central Chile, community activist Ramón Balcázar, now 36, became aware of the potential damage of large-scale mining at an early age. Long-running disputes – over land use, water rights and chemical contamination – provided the background to his youth in the 90s. Then, six years ago, he moved to the northern outpost of San Pedro de Atacama. On the lip of the country’s famed Andean salt flats, the town looks out to a coarse, sun-baked carpet of crystalline whites and smudgy grey. There, under this huge, cloudless desert sky, Balcázar finally felt able to breathe freely.', 'He did not know it, but he had walked into another battle zone. San Pedro lies on the westernmost point of a mining area that spreads north across the Atacama desert to Bolivia and east into Argentina. Fifty times drier than California’s Death valley, the area’s parched surface conceals an underworld rich in minerals. Historically, mining companies have exploited its lucrative deposits of copper and, to a lesser extent, iodine and nitrates. By some estimates, it also contains as much as half the world’s lithium reserves. In the early to mid-2010s, when talk of lithium-ion batteries began circulating in every mining town, a raft of new licences were requested, investments made, and extraction facilities expanded. The area became known as the “lithium triangle”.', 'The mining companies insist their operations are sustainable. Balcázar, speaking from Mexico City, where he is studying for a graduate research degree, said they have no evidence for this claim. No one knows what effects lithium extraction on such a large scale will have on the Atacama’s fragile natural ecosystem. Unlike in Portugal, lithium here is found in brine, so the mining operations use no dynamite and no earthmovers, and threaten to leave no unsightly craters. Instead, they consist of a series of large, neatly segregated evaporation pools filled with millions of litres of brine that have been pumped from below the surface and left to evaporate in the sun.', 'The fears of residents like Balcázar are focused on the area’s cavernous, subterranean aquifers, from where the brine is pumped. Here, they maintain, a disaster is unfolding. There is a risk that the reserves of clean water, which are found in a separate layer above the brine deposits, may become contaminated.', 'Balcázar has been working with the Plurinational Observatory of Andean Salt Flats, a network of expert scientists and concerned citizens, to chart changes to the local ecology. The weight of their evidence – shrinking pasturelands, failing crops, disappearing flora and fauna – all point towards a process of desertification which they believe is exacerbated by lithium extraction. The impact of disturbing a “huge, complex hydrological system” is not visible from one day to the next, said Balcázar. “But the two are interlinked, without any doubt.”', 'Plans by lithium mining firm SQM to expand its operations were recently blocked by a Chilean court on environmental grounds, but almost every other effort to get the backing of the authorities has failed. In Chile, Balcázar said, certain territories and natural environments have always been “sacrificeable” in the name of progress.', 'While mining firms scour the world’s deserts and countryside for lithium concentrate, a parallel search is on to find ways of producing battery-grade lithium without sending in the diggers. On an industrial estate surrounded by fields in rural Saxony, Christian Hanisch set out to discover a solution in recycling. “What if, instead of extracting virgin lithium from the ground, we use what we already have?” he said. Half a million tonnes of lithium has been extracted and refined in the past decade, much of which now sits in discarded mobile phones and laptops approaching obsolescence.', 'In his modest first-floor office at Duesenfeld, the company he co-founded while working on his PhD at Braunschweig University of Technology, Hanisch, 37, admitted that the logistics are challenging. The lithium-ion batteries in everyday devices are typically small and fiddly, so to make his venture viable, Hanisch decided to start big, with used electric car batteries (which each contain about 8kg of reusable lithium). He pointed out of the window, where several recently delivered samples were piled up on the tarmac outside the factory next door, each the size of a chunky mattress.', 'Removing the battery’s heavy plastic casing is easy enough; the challenge is how to access the lithium inside the battery cell itself. Currently, two main options exist: either heat the components to about 300C to evaporate the lithium, or apply acids and other reducing agents to leach it. Both approaches are complicated by lithium’s extreme volatility (it is prone to exploding) and its amalgamation with other metals (which are added in for better conductivity).', 'With market analysts predicting a potential 12-fold increase in the value of the global lithium recycling industry over next decade, to more than $18bn by 2030, competition among recycling innovators is hotting up. In Germany alone, Duesenfeld faces competition from at least three other early-stage lithium recyclers. Across the border in Belgium, a former smelting firm turned urban waste recycler, Umicore, is developing its own technology, but releasing no details. Another significant European player is Snam, in France.', 'Hanisch is confident that his procedure has an edge. Rather than smelting (which is highly energy intensive) or leaching (extremely toxic), Duesenfeld’s approach is based on mechanical separation. This method involves physically breaking the battery down into its component parts and then extracting the residual lithium via a combination of magnetisation and distillation.', 'In the company’s factory, amid a cacophony of whirring and clanking, a submarine-like cylindrical contraption (“that’s the crusher”, shouted Hanisch through the ear protectors clamped to my head) occupies the back wall. Filling the space between is a jungle of pipes, funnels and conveyor belts punctuated by worktops. Quite where the production line begins or ends is unclear. Hanisch regarded his invention with a blissful expression. “It’s noisy,” he conceded, “But it’s the greenest way of recycling lithium there is.”', 'Hanisch was brought up in a farming family in rural Lower Saxony, a background that inspired his environmental ambitions. Earlier this year he launched a consultancy venture, No Canary, advising on low-carbon methods for producing not just a battery, but an entire electric vehicle, from the materials stage through to final disposal. “Greta [Thunberg] was right”, he told listeners to his inaugural webinar. “We aren’t moving nearly fast enough on decarbonisation.”', 'Shifting away from petrol and diesel is not the only concern. Manufacturing any car, electric or otherwise, causes carbon emissions, be it from the coal used to smelt the steel for its body work or the diesel oil burned when shipping its electronic components across oceans. The extra materials and energy involved in manufacturing a lithium-ion battery mean that, at present, the carbon emissions associated with producing an electric car are higher than those for a vehicle running on petrol or diesel – by as much as 38%, according to some calculations. Until the electricity in national grids is entirely renewable, recharging the battery will involve a degree of dependence on coal or gas-fired power stations.', 'Lithium accounts for a small part of the battery’s cost, which means there is less incentive for manufacturers to find an alternative. As it is, recycling lithium costs more than digging it out of the ground. For Hanisch, one of the chief costs comes at the end of the process: converting the recovered lithium from its recycled state (lithium sulphate) into a battery-ready form (lithium carbonate). Without the resources to build his own chemical plant, Duesenfeld sends his end product – a grainy composite of precious metals known as “black mass” – to a hydrometallurgical facility for final processing.', 'For existing recycling plants, lithium is not where the money lies, said Linda Gaines, an expert in battery recycling systems at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. As she said: “The main purpose is to recover the cobalt, as well as nickel and copper. The lithium doesn’t add much.”', 'As with wind turbines and solar panels, the price of recycled lithium will very likely come down as battery manufacturers scale up. Supposing this proves true, there’s a huge supply-demand imbalance to get over. Before the pandemic, total sales of electric vehicles were projected to more than quadruple in the next five years, to more than 11m units. Demand for lithium will rise accordingly, with one industry estimate suggesting annual consumption could easily reach 700,000 tonnes by the middle of this decade. So, even if Duesenfeld and its competitors were able to recycle every last ounce of lithium produced in the last decade, come 2025, it would only be enough to power new electric vehicle batteries for nine months.', 'As it turns out, the recession caused by the pandemic may have granted campaigners a reprieve, halting the immediate need to open new lithium mines. With the world facing a prolonged crisis, new cars – even eco-friendly ones – are not at the top of most people’s priorities. As manufacture has slowed down, a glut of lithium on global markets has dampened the white oil boom, if only temporarily.', 'But investors remain bullish about lithium’s long-term prospects. With a change of regime in the White House, there is hope for renewed support for measures to tackle the climate crisis. In the fortnight after the US election, the stock price of Chile-based lithium mine company Albermarle rose by more than 20%. In the UK, Boris Johnson’s announcement about bringing forward a ban on new diesel and petrol cars to 2030 gave the market a boost.', 'The European commission still wants a lithium industry to call its own. In September, the Slovak diplomat and a commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič publicly endorsed Portugal’s plans as “necessary” for the automotive sector. What’s more, the European Investment Bank would be on hand to help, he promised. His comment chimed with the launch of a new EU strategy on raw materials, which, among other goals, seeks to increase Europe’s lithium supply 18-fold by 2030, while reducing Europe’s dependence on third-party countries.', 'This is discouraging for the opponents of lithium mines in Portugal, but Šefčovič offered them a crumb of comfort. The decision to mine has to be taken in dialogue “with local communities”, he asserted, adding that “we need to assure these communities that these projects are not only of the greatest importance, but will also benefit the region and the country”.', 'The modern corporate responsibility movement is built on such logic. First, it does not promise to eliminate all negative industrial impacts. Instead, it pledges to “manage” them, and then to balance out any damage with compensatory “benefits”, to use Šefčovič’s phrase. In the case of Savannah’s mine in northern Portugal, the company concedes there will be local environmental impact, but argues that it will be outweighed by the upsides (inward investment, jobs, community projects).', 'Godofredo Pereira, a Portuguese environmental architect based at the Royal College of Art in London, is sceptical. His first-hand observations of the exploitation of Chile’s salt flats suggest that offers of dialogue can be superficial. Even in Atacama, where international accords give indigenous groups the right to “free, prior, informed consent”, detractors such as Balcázar struggle to be heard. Instead, the view of pro-mining community groups is taken as universal. If necessary, the obligation to gain consent can be weakened simply by defining lithium as a mineral of “strategic” or “critical” national value – which is easy enough, given lithium’s contribution to slowing global heating and cleaner air.', 'Nor, very often, do the promised trade-offs turn out to be quite what they initially seem, according to Pereira. The voluntary nature of corporate responsibility means mining firms can backtrack if it suits them. Even when local groups succeed in negotiating a fixed royalty (3.5% of sales, in the case of one major extractor in Atacama), communities frequently split in the subsequent fight for the spoils.', 'Digging up Portugal’s mountains in the name of green technology may still be avoidable. An alternative, less controversial technology could break on to the scene. Green hydrogen, for instance, could help offset up to 10% of Europe’s emissions. A more immediate solution would be to rethink how we get around. As Thea Riofrancos at Providence College pointed out, if everyone were to adopt “rational forms of transport” – such as trains, trams, e-buses, cycling and car-sharing – then demand for passenger vehicles of all kinds would shrink overnight.', 'For Portugal’s anti-mining groups, however, the clock is ticking. Godofredo argued that citizens must demand a dialogue, in order to “get a conversation going about what model of development we want”. If people were better informed, he reasoned, it’s just possible that public opinion could swing to their side, and the country’s lithium mining plans could get shelved. In this regard, recent demands by Portugal’s Green party for a national impact evaluation of mining policy is promising.', 'Portugal’s protesters can see that blocking green growth won’t get them far. These interior regions need investment. Hence the banner hanging from the playground fence in João Cassote’s neighbouring village, which reads “Sim à Vida” (Yes to life) beside “Não à Mina” (No to the Mine). “Life” for opponents of the mine, including Mario Inacio and Maria Carmo, is eco-tourism, regenerative farming, local supply chains, and other tenets of low-carbon living. For Cassote, it means a decent wage for a decent day’s work. For a green future, it’s going to be vital to accommodate both visions.', 'This article was amended on 30 December 2020.

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/31/calls-from-the-deep-do-we-need-to-save-the-whales-all-over-again,"['Fifty years ago, a hit album proved whales “sing” – and led to one of the great environmental success stories. But soon it could all be for nothing', 'In June 1975, a small group of activists set off from the coast of California in an 85ft boat. They were headed for the Dalniy Vostok factory ship, which was at sea conducting business as usual: harpooning sperm whales.', 'The activists were members of Greenpeace, an organisation that had only recently been founded, in Vancouver in 1971, and they were setting out to meet the Russian whaling ship under the banner of what would become one of the most famous slogans of the environmental movement, Save the Whales.', 'They thought they knew what to expect. Inspired by the Canadian ecologist and writer Farley Mowat, who had explained that commercial whaling was taking some species close to extinction, Greenpeace had decided to make saving whales a key part of its mission – specifically to photograph the reality of commercial whaling at sea, which few people had ever witnessed.', 'But what they saw when the Dalniy Vostok came into view was a shock nonetheless.', '“There was blood all over the water, there were dead whales in the water, and there was a large pipe that came out from the hull of the factory ship that was running constantly with blood,” says Rex Weyler, co-founder of Greenpeace.', '“We could see the giant slabs of whale being ripped off the bone. There was the stench of dead whales and blood, and there were sharks in the water. It was a horror show.”', 'Amid the carnage, Wexler and activists including Paul Watson, who went on to found the campaign group Sea Shepherd, attempted to slow the whale hunt by placing themselves between the live animals and the harpooners, and took photos.', 'But they also tried something unexpected of their own. Using an onboard sound system, they began to blast an eerie noise: whale song, taken from the 1970 album, Songs of the Humpback Whale.', 'Produced by marine biologist Dr Roger Payne from audio of male humpbacks singing off the coast of Bermuda, Songs of the Humpback Whale had been a surprise hit with the public, and remains the only multiplatinum-selling album of animal sounds. It also announced a scientific breakthrough: Payne and his team had found that whales don’t just call but actually sing to each other, in slowly repeating patterns.', 'The success of the album had been one of the reasons Greenpeace chose whaling as an early focus in the first place. By the early 1970s, public understanding had advanced to the point that whales became animals that “people internationally could all relate to”, says Weyler. “Whales are intelligent. They have families. And they even, we learned at that time, make music and vocalise. The whale was the perfect species in danger that could stand for all of wild nature.”', 'As the activists turned on the loudspeakers to blast it at the Dalniy Vostok, they also hoped whale song could be a language that could cross boundaries.', '“We came right up beside the giant ship. The crew lined the rails of three decks, towering above us,” recalls Weyler of the moment when they played the music. “It was quite dramatic. They waved and shouted and hooted. They seemed, to tell you the truth, quite friendly and interested in us.', '“And they were fascinated by the whale sound. Very few of the crew on the boat were actually whalers and harpooners. There were people working in the kitchens, boathands, people who were cutting up and processing the whales dragged on board.”', 'The effect was profound. Although the harpooners did not stop whaling that day, Greenpeace had scored a success. The anti-whaling movement would go on to transform world opinion, paving the way for the International Whaling Commission’s (IWC) 1982 decision to ban commercial whaling starting in 1986 – of which Russia, along with Japan, was one of the biggest proponents. The Dalniy Vostok would eventually cease whaling and became a fishing trawler. (In 2015, it sank off the coast of Russia, killing most of the crew.)', 'Whale populations began to rise, and have done so – with some exceptions – ever since. As of May 2020, humpback whale populations had returned to 93% of their pre-whaling size.', 'But in 2020, 50 years on from the release of the album, whales are once again in the global headlines for all the wrong reasons. A new series of threats to whales have appeared. Commercial whaling has started to return, with Norway and Japan among the countries that have abandoned the IWC ban. And whaling is the least of it. Collisions with ships, bycatch from fishing, habitat loss due to the climate emergency and a global plastic pollution crisis are hitting whales from all directions on a scale unknown in the 1970s.', 'Most pernicious of all, however, is the noise.', '“Shipping has increased by 300% in the past two decades and noise is a massive issue,” says Helen McLachlan, fisheries programme manager for the Worldwide Fund for Nature. “Sound in the water is really important for the toothed whales like sperm whales, which use sound to identify prey and to navigate. If you upset those functions then you are undermining that animal’s ability to survive.”', 'The deadly threat posed to whale song by shipping noise was underlined during the pandemic, when whales got a brief respite from the din. In lockdown-quietened waters, researchers were able to record whales singing with increased frequency, and at lower volumes. But with new vaccines emerging and the global economy adjusting to the pandemic restrictions, the “lockdown effect” looks set to be a blip. Fifty years since an album of whale songs brought to public attention one of the great wonders of the ocean, do we need to save the whales all over again?', '“When I discovered that humpbacks were singing, one of my biggest worries was, ‘well, nobody knows what a humpback whale is’,” says Payne, now 85, speaking from his home in Vermont. “The attitude that people had to whales then is very hard to conjure up in our age. It was sort of, ‘uh-huh’. People knew whales were very big, and that was about it.”', 'He first heard whales singing in the late 1960s, on tapes made by a US navy engineer, Frank Watlington. Watlington had been listening out for explosions off the coast of Bermuda, but was surprised to find the noises obscured by the sound of whales calling to each other. Using military hydrophones, he recorded the whale vocalisations at rare length.', 'A whale enthusiast himself, Watlington recognised the recordings’ potential significance, and passed them to two visiting marine biologists: Payne and his then wife, Katy.', 'We still don’t know all the reasons that baleen whales sing, but it is thought to be how male humpbacks advertise their location and credentials to potential mates. Katy Payne, a researcher in acoustic biology at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, used the recordings to prove that male humpbacks sing the same songs together in groups, and gradually compose new ones, changing their songs each year. Females are thought to be attracted to males singing the most “current” songs.', 'If it was a breakthrough to realise that the whales could sing, perhaps as remarkable was discovering how emotionally involving the songs of these vast marine mammals are to human ears.', '“Something about their sounds knocked me out, inspired a sense of wonder, just a ‘wow’ reaction,” recalls Roger Payne of hearing the recordings for the first time, and realising they could help draw public attention to whales. “It felt obvious to me that this is the way that we can capture people’s imagination.”', 'Payne produced the album from Watlington’s audio and released it commercially as Songs of the Humpback Whale. The album was a hit. National Geographic magazine gave it a further boost by distributing 10.5m promotional copies. Payne says he has seen crowds of 200 people burst into tears on hearing it. “The definition of a song is simply a repeated rhythmic pattern,” he says, but whale song transmits “a message that gets to other levels of your brain than the songs of most animals.', '“Some of the laws of musical composition of humpbacks’ songs are the same as in human music,” he notes. “Whales, for example, use sonata form: the establishment of a theme and then a variation, then a return. Well, how the hell do you explain that? My suspicion is that music probably vastly predates our species.”', 'What’s more, Katy Payne and her colleague Linda Guinee would go on to prove that humpback songs also use the equivalent of “rhyme”: consistent end-note sounds to the most complex sections, thought to be a mnemonic device to help the whales memorise the longest songs.', 'Songs of the Humpback Whale heralded a cultural shift, as awareness of whales’ intriguingly human-like qualities became widespread. The “great whales” – including humpbacks and blue whales – became awe-inspiring wildlife icons, a status that is now self-evident.', 'They were also in unparalleled danger. Commercial whaling had existed since the 1800s, but by the mid-1960s it was happening on a mass scale around the world. It was largely through the efforts of Greenpeace that the public began to realise the threats posed to whales, after the activists returned from their shocking encounter with the Dalniy Vostok.', '“It was a really traumatising experience for all of us on the Greenpeace ship,” says Weyler, speaking from his home on Cortes Island, British Columbia. “We had never seen anything like that.”', 'Still, he credits that trip and the resulting photographs for beginning to change public opinion.', '“We were aware that just explaining that the whales were being hunted would not be enough to get the attention of global policymakers and media. By confronting the whalers and bringing the pictures of the horror of the slaughter, that’s what shocked the world – and brought ecology into the modern era.”', 'In 1974, a 14-year-old girl named Maris Sidenstecker was one of those shocked. The teenager, from Los Angeles, had come across an article in an inflight magazine explaining the new existential threat to blue whales. “I just could not get it out of my mind,” says Sidenstecker, now a marine biologist.', 'Inspired, she designed and printed a T-shirt with her drawing of a blue whale and the words, “Save the whales”.', 'People began to ask her where they could buy one and soon, through a small ad in Rolling Stone magazine, Sidenstecker was shipping T-shirts nationwide. “That’s when we really started selling a lot more,” she says, “boxes and boxes of them.” At the age of 16, Sidenstecker founded a charity, Save The Whales, which she still runs today. It was official: saving whales was mainstream, and the anti-whaling campaign went worldwide.', '“Later, we confronted the whalers in the mid-Pacific around Hawaii and then, even later Greenpeace, Sea Shepherd and other organisations confronted whaling fleets in the South Pacific and South Atlantic,” recalls Weyler. “It became a global movement.”', 'By the 1980s, as the IWC ban came into effect and populations began slowly to recover, crowding on to the deck of a boat to catch a glimpse of a whale’s back became a life-affirming way to spend leisure time. “Whale-watching was something I pushed right from the start,” says Payne, “because if you see a whale up close you’re not going to forget it.” The 1986 film Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home captured the zeitgeist with its story of saving humpback whales in San Francisco Bay. Save the Whales had become – along with the effort to reduce the hole in the ozone layer – perhaps the greatest environmental success story of the 20th century.', 'Incidentally, Sidenstecker never claimed to have invented the phrase “save the whales”. Greenpeace chose it independently for its campaign, and in a 2015 interview with NPR, Katy Payne remembered Watlington telling them, “Go and save the whales”. At one point Sidenstecker attempted to register the name for her charity. “We did try to trademark the name about 20 years ago,” she says from her home in whale-rich Monterey Bay, California. “We were told to forget it. It’s a phrase in the public domain now that everyone uses.”', 'Just as the world thought whales were saved, however, new threats began to emerge. In 1993, just seven years after the IWC whaling ban, Norway broke from the agreement and resumed commercial whaling; it is still the world’s biggest killer of whales. Japan abandoned the agreement in 2018. Iceland, too, is also still whaling, though there are signs that the practice might be coming to an end as whale-watching tourism makes better economic sense.', 'Still, commercial whaling pales in comparison to the death toll in what is known as “bycatch”. Whales are frequently entangled in fishing gear, such as lines joining equipment on the seabed to surface buoys, or killed while fishers are hunting other species. Worldwide, bycatch kills as many as 300,000 whales, dolphins and porpoises every year, making it by far the biggest killer of cetaceans. According to the WWF, bycatch led to the recent extinction of the Yangtze river dolphin in China, and is a critical threat to endangered North Atlantic right whales and Arabian Sea humpback whales, among many other cetacean species.', 'Another threat is from commercial shipping, particularly collisions. “Vessels are getting bigger and travelling more quickly, which makes them a key threat to whales,” says McLachlan. Whales struck by ships often die, and a recent study  suggested that speed limits don’t always help: even slow-moving boats are likely to kill endangered right whales in a collision.', 'But the most poignant new threat of all, given the profound impact of Songs of the Humpback Whale, must be the disruption of their song caused by the noise from commercial shipping, which has had a direct effect on whale populations. “It’s about communication, including for breeding and between mothers and calves,” says McLachlan of whale song. “You know yourself that if you’re in a crowded pub. You have to shout to be heard, and it’s exhausting after a while.”', 'Some scientists also speculate that commercial shipping noise may be altering the content of the whale songs. Michelle Fournet of Cornell University hypothesises that whale song may be richer and more complex when human-generated noise abates, as it did during the pandemic, when reduced shipping activity briefly allowed humpbacks to benefit from the clearer singing conditions. That effect is not likely to last, however.', 'Some solutions are being sought, such as responsive shipping routes plotted to avoid areas where whales are likely to be breeding, feeding or migrating. In Canada’s Bay of Fundy, “shipping lanes were moved for right whales, and they returned to areas they had vacated”, says McLachlan. “There is even whale-avoidance software that vessels can operate.”', 'In October 2020, blue whale song was also found to change during migratory journeys, with a Stanford University study showing that whales’ switch from night-time to daytime singing as they start to migrate – potentially another way to better predict whales’ migration routes, and thus help reduce collisions. Similarly, with bycatch, technological innovation could help lower casualties from fishing equipment with, for example, remote collection of lobster traps rather than lines attached to a buoy on the surface.', 'Many of the threats cannot be solved with technology, however. Critical habitat loss and the plastic pollution crisis are threats for which taking action after the fact is often too little, or too late, or simply impossible. For example, once toxic PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) had entered the food chain, banning them did not change that fact. They are still found in orcas off Scotland.', '“It is key for overall ocean health that we have a healthy, dynamic population of these top predators,” says McLachlan. She adds that, because whales store tonnes of carbon dioxide in their bodies, they are also key to mitigating the climate crisis. If whales are threatened, it’s bad news for all of us.', 'Roger Payne’s obsession with what he calls “whale speak” continues to inform his research. As well as discovering that some whales sing, another breakthrough was calculating just how far some great whales can hear. In deep ocean (and, he adds, in a pre-human-noise-pollution world), “I was shocked to calculate that blue whales and fin whales could hear each other as far as 13,000 miles away.”', 'But it’s the languid musicality of whale song itself that connected with so many people. Otherworldly in the truest sense, it predates humans by tens of millions of years. There is something else that plays on Payne’s mind, something he has never been able to prove, and probably never will.', '“My suspicion is that the difference between whale communication and human communication may be that they are transmitting emotions directly,” he says. “We can’t do that. We need words.”']",[],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8540fd82b15a767e6fb86ac71d91e895b0de5d03/63_101_1071_643/master/1071.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'Part of the album cover of Songs of the Humpback Whale, which remains the only multiplatinum-selling album of animal sounds.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93714a502e9afabd38f537ebe7226ff5319dcb84/0_0_800_524/master/800.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Dead whales being dragged along behind factory ship Dalniy Vostok.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5abf2fade7aa5d117305135a987bb837cc7cb9ca/0_65_733_498/master/733.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'The Greenpeace crew playing music to the crew of the Soviet ships.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5b6864c1936a4764cce3fc4df94fbb1a587c3a3/0_0_799_525/master/799.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Russian Whaling Fleet in North Pacific'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1c2faa51ec2ab3e1eedce2ce82261fc3ae3678d/0_0_2000_1333/master/2000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'A picture taken by anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd shows the bloodied deck of a Japanese ship, the Nisshin Maru, near Antarctica.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/533a7825d21ac78fed1db89b04103d50137345ce/0_0_5669_3780/master/5669.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'A humpback whale with calf.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2442b4e894a9da52f4397ebd49e9408547a75ae/0_0_4561_3045/master/4561.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Roger Payne pets whale, Peninsula Valdez, Argentina'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19046783bf641b30c56d03df25b78646936ec54c/0_0_3504_2336/master/3504.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'A 46-foot juvenile fin whale that was struck by a cargo ship and carried into the Long Beach harbor in Long Beach, Calif.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e76737353206dd7762025ea7e46e372928871dd/0_94_5394_3236/master/5394.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'A humpback whale mother with her calf off the coast of Tonga.

After five years failing to reduce emissions in line with the Paris climate accord, we must now face the consequences. While bold and fair efforts to cut emissions and naturally drawdown carbon are essential, researchers in many areas consider societal collapse a credible scenario this century. Different views exist on the location, extent, timing, permanence and cause of disruptions, but the way modern societies exploit people and nature is a common concern.', 'Only if policymakers begin to discuss this threat of societal collapse might we begin to reduce its likelihood, speed, severity, harm to the most vulnerable – and to nature.', 'Some armed services already see collapse as an important scenario. Surveys show many people now anticipate societal collapse. Sadly, that is the experience of many communities in the global south.

Mourão claimed the annual increase of 9.5% was less than half the anticipated figure of about 20%.', '“We’re not here to commemorate any of this, because it’s nothing to commemorate. But it means that the efforts being launched [against Amazon deforestation] are starting to yield fruit,” Mourão claimed.', 'Environmentalists, who blame Bolsonaro’s deliberate weakening of enforcement efforts for the rise, scoffed at that reading. “This number is an outrage – it doesn’t tell us anything positive about the Bolsonaro administration at all. On the contrary, it shows that despite the [Covid-19] quarantine, environmental crime has increased,” Rittl said.', 'Mourão’s comment about the smaller-than-expected rise was “like saying that we were expecting 300,000 Covid deaths and we ‘only’ had 200,000,” Rittl added.', 'Cristiane Mazzetti, a Greenpeace spokesperson for the Amazon, said: “This is an even worse number than 2019 and a direct reflection of the Bolsonaro administration’s anti-environmental policies which have weakened the monitoring agencies and used misguided strategies to fight deforestation, such as deploying the armed forces rather than environmental protection agents.”', '“These numbers show us that we are continuing to move in the wrong direction than the one needed to deal with the climate emergency and the biodiversity crisis.”', 'The Observatório do Clima group said soaring destruction came as no surprise to those “following the dismantling of environmental policy that has been underway in Brazil since January 2019”.', '“The numbers simply show that Jair Bolsonaro’s plan has worked. They are the result of a successful project to annihilate the ability of the Brazilian state and its monitoring agencies to care for our forests and fight crime in the Amazon,” it said in a statement.', 'Mourão said the figures, which were produced with information from the Prodes satellite system, showed most of the devastation was occurring in four regions: Pará state, the north of Mato Grosso state, the south of Amazonas state and Rondônia.', 'Pará, a longtime deforestation hotspot, was by far the worst-affected state accounting for almost 47% of the total deforestation.', '“Thanks to Inpe’s work we now have a perfect sense of where we need to focus our actions in order to prevent illegal activities occurring,” Mourão told reporters, praising its “brilliant scientists” for their efforts.', 'But despite a growing “green” government propaganda campaign – which recently saw Mourão take foreign ambassadors on a tour of the Amazon region – environmentalists and foreign investors are skeptical about its efforts to protect the world’s biggest rainforest.', 'During that three-day excursion ambassadors were not taken to any of the deforestation hotspots which Mourão detailed on Monday – and activists dismissed the visit as a “sham”.', 'In May thousands of Brazilian troops were sent to the Amazon supposedly to fight environmental crime, although some believe they are merely making things worse.', 'Rittl said one ray of light was the recent defeat of Bolsonaro’s key international ally, Donald Trump. “Without the backing of Trump in the US, the international pressure [on Bolsonaro over the environment] will increase and it will increase a lot,” he predicted.', 'Bolsonaro is one of only a tiny group of world leaders who has yet to recognise Joe Biden’s victory and on Sunday claimed, without proof, that unnamed “sources” had convinced him the US election had been plagued with fraud.']",['Tom Phillips'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54bd6d91068963be1e91b47f85efa7935a56eb2d/0_26_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'More than 11,000 sq km of rainforest was destroyed in Brazil between between August 2019 and July 202o, official figures show.

It gives an insight into the workings of the organisation that produces the Guardian, the Observer, and the Guardian’s editions in the US and Australia, over the last year.', 'This year was the most challenging and extraordinary year for news that I can remember, and I’m sure many of you feel the same way.', 'As you’ll read in this report, our journalists worked tirelessly throughout 2020, from the very start of the year with the Australian bushfires, through the struggle for Hong Kong, the Harvey Weinstein verdict to the death of George Floyd, and the dramatic and divisive US presidential election.', 'But of course, the Covid-19 pandemic was the dominant global story of the year, transforming so much, from our editorial priorities to how we work. Our coverage sought to foreground the science and the latest data, to hold the government and the scientific establishment to account and expose incompetence, and to bring empathy and humanity to the stories of the victims.', 'We realised early on that the pandemic had the capacity to change everything about how we live, so Guardian and Observer journalists devoted formidable effort and resources to investigating the social and economic effects of this crisis. We also understood the important role that endeavour, community and charity would play in confronting the emergency, and so sought out hope wherever it could be found.', 'We expanded our reporting on the climate and environmental crisis, following the movements trying to bring about change, digging deep into the loss of wildlife and investigating the mounting problems of air pollution and microplastics. We also drew the connection between the Covid crisis and the environment, trying to get politicians to understand how the pandemic is the result of our annihilation of nature, year after year.', 'Our investigations team produced a succession of game-changing revelations about the UK government’s handling of the pandemic, such as the scandalous disregard for life in care homes, and the repeated mishandling of vital protection equipment for healthcare workers.', 'In the UK, our sensational revelation, in partnership with the Daily Mirror, that the prime minister’s right-hand man, Dominic Cummings, had travelled from London to Durham during lockdown, and then taken a 50-mile trip to Barnard Castle to “test his eyesight”, resulted in a public outcry. Our reporting, like a lot of the best stories, originated with Guardian readers who told us what they had seen.', 'Our investigations were not limited to the UK. We also revealed further allegations of sexual abuse committed by Donald Trump, and unearthed the disturbing background of his supreme court justice pick, Amy Coney Barrett. We published the Luanda Leaks, showing how Africa’s richest woman, Isabel dos Santos, made her fortune through exploiting her own country, and revealed Jeff Bezos had his phone hacked by the Saudi crown prince – a truly astonishing exposé.', 'These kinds of revelations are at the heart of what we do. Without reader support, we would have fewer resources for the time-consuming, painstaking reporting that often takes weeks or months to get to the front page. If you are a Guardian supporter, thank you for helping us to bring these stories to light.', 'Guardian journalists in the US, UK and around the world have reported with clarity, authority and calm on the Black Lives Matter movement, the debate on monuments to slavery, and the broader social and political questions they raise.', 'In the US, our election coverage included rigorous analysis of the myriad ways millions of Americans are denied voting rights, extensive reporting on the primary and presidential campaigns, and round-the-clock analysis of the election itself. We spoke to voters in often-overlooked communities to understand who and what was motivating them to vote.', 'In Australia, our reporters worked over the festive period to provide unrivalled live coverage of the unprecedented bushfires that ravaged the east coast. The team followed this up with The Frontline, an in-depth multimedia investigation into the many ways the climate emergency is already affecting Australia.', 'Our numbers: +66% in podcast listens, including for Today in Focus, Football Weekly and Full Story **', 'Our multimedia journalism continues to go from strength to strength. Today in Focus, presented by Anushka Asthana, took home the best current affairs podcast prize at this year’s British Podcast Awards. And we had an incredible 12 months in video (including our standout series on the US election, Anywhere but Washington, and Anywhere but Westminster, covering stories of altruism and community during lockdown) – reaching 3.5 million subscribers across our YouTube network.', 'While these are challenging times for media organisations for a number of reasons, financial support for the Guardian from digital readers in every corner of the world has grown as readers seek out expert journalism and analysis they can trust.', 'The Guardian and the Observer have a history of powerful, high-impact journalism that is read by millions of people worldwide. We now receive support from readers in more than 180 countries, helping us to safeguard the Guardian’s independent journalism.', 'The pandemic and its effects have made life much harder for Guardian readers and supporters around the world. This year, even more than in the past, we are extremely grateful for the financial support readers give to help safeguard our independent journalism.', 'Thank you.', 'I joined the Guardian in March 2020, a few weeks before the first lockdown in the UK. At that point I could never have imagined just how much our business would need to change and adapt in what has been an extraordinary year.', 'My priorities as chief executive throughout the pandemic have been to ensure we continue to serve our readers, digitally and in print, while prioritising the safety of our employees and minimising the economic impact of the pandemic on our business. Strong Guardian journalism relies on a solid business and a team of dedicated commercial colleagues across many different departments. Working life has been very different in 2020, and I am extremely grateful for the commitment and flexibility our employees have shown this year.', 'Our numbers: 2.1 billion unique browsers to our digital platforms, +67% on the year before **', 'The growing appetite for Guardian journalism was reflected in continued growth in readership – we had a record 1.5bn unique browsers and 16.4bn page views to our digital platforms during 2019-20, both up more than 20% on the previous 12 months.', 'Whilst we experienced record digital readership, coronavirus has accelerated difficult changes across the media sector – we have responded by restructuring some areas of our business as part of a strategy to support the Guardian’s long-term commercial growth. Sadly these changes have included job losses for a number of colleagues, to whom we will say goodbye over the next few months. This process has been difficult, and we have aimed to support all those affected as much as possible. We thank those leaving the organisation greatly for their contribution to the Guardian.', 'Despite these pressures, our unique reader relationship model has proved successful. As our editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, writes, the Guardian has provided independent, fact-based journalism to unprecedented numbers of readers and we have seen an increase in readers’ support over the past year.', 'Since the start of 2020, we have gained 268,000 new digital subscriptions and recurring contributions, an increase of 43%. As a result, digital reader revenues have continued to grow – with recurring contributions and digital subscriptions (boosted by the popularity of our flagship Editions app) two critical sources of income to support our business and our journalism. Print subscriptions to the Guardian, the Observer and our international news magazine Guardian Weekly (with 70% of its subscribers living outside the UK) have also grown to record levels. And in the past 12 months we have received more than 530,000 single contributions from readers who believe in the Guardian’s purpose, and want to support us. Including print subscribers and single contributions, people have supported the Guardian financially more than 1.5m times in the last 12 months.', 'Our numbers: 75,000 attendees to our Guardian Live online programme **', 'We adapted very quickly to the new normal. Guardian Live made a successful pivot to digital, with over 75,000 attendees to our online events, and Guardian Jobs supported the NHS, offering free job listings.', 'And, while the advertising market remains challenging, teams have continued to win new business and high-value repeat bookings – a testament to the strength of our relationships and reputation for brilliant execution.', 'Our international outlook and presence continues to deliver for us commercially as well as strengthening Guardian journalism, with significant growth in the US and Australia where we have well-established presences. And, in the year of Brexit, we have had record numbers reading and supporting the Guardian financially from continental Europe. We will continue to invest in the Guardian’s increasingly global business.', 'We live in a time of great economic uncertainty. There are many challenges ahead for the global news media sector, but we remain confident that the Guardian’s core strengths – high-quality, trusted journalism, a meaningful purpose and trusted brand, a highly talented set of employees, and a commitment to being reader-centric and reader-funded – provide a solid foundation for the organisation to achieve long-term success.', 'Thank you for supporting us. In a deeply troubling year it is inspiring that so many readers agree that progressive journalism is needed more than ever.', 'Readers in 180 countries fund our journalism because they believe in our mission, our independence, and our reporting – and that’s inspiring to all of us who work at the Guardian.', 'From our supporters: Only this week I was recommending the Guardian subscription to a friend because it is such good value for the money. Having read today’s newsletter, I have just altered my contribution and will endeavour to increase it further in due course. In this ever more dangerous world and the sinister manoeuvring of our own government, independent reportage with integrity, which is what you provide, is essential and I thank you for it. Liz Hanson, a reader in Melrose, Scotland', 'Our unique ownership model means we are not controlled by a billionaire owner, or a group of shareholders demanding financial returns – any profits made, and all financial contributions from readers, are reinvested directly into our journalism.', 'Many supporters believe, like we do, that everyone deserves access to quality journalism, so choose to help us remain open and free of a paywall. Our supporters tell us that they deeply value the approach we have chosen – where everyone can access Guardian journalism, regardless of where they live, what they can afford, or how they like to consume the news.', 'Alongside our successful contributions model, in 2020 we have a renewed focus on offering digital subscriptions to our premium apps, in order to build a financially sustainable organisation.', 'As part of our ongoing mission to deliver purposeful, quality journalism, we have evolved our digital subscription products in line with the changing demands of readers in a world of constant breaking news, best digital practices and journalistic innovation. In 2020, we introduced a Weekend Edition for Australian readers, as well as a special Earth Edition to sit alongside our UK Daily Edition – available as part of the Guardian’s digital subscription. We also launched Guardian Puzzles – a dedicated app for crosswords and puzzles from the Guardian and the Observer.', 'From our supporters: I so appreciate the excellent and authentic reporting that the Guardian does – never more than now. I depend on your reporters and photographers to cover US stories with a deep cultural understanding of not only the news, but also the underlying issues that provide a necessary context to truly make sense of where we find ourselves today. Thank you for all that you all do! Susan E Werbe, a reader in Newton, Massachusetts, US', 'Remarkably, despite the health and economic depredations of Covid-19, record numbers of readers chose to financially support us in 2020. The ongoing developments around the global coronavirus pandemic, the Black Lives Matter movement as well as the Guardian’s climate pledge and its US election coverage have all been significant drivers of reader support.', 'Our numbers: 900,000 digital recurring acts of support, +43% since November 2019 **', 'The Guardian has gained 268,000 new digital subscriptions and recurring contributions over the last year, an increase of 43%. Total digital recurring support now stands at over 900,000, up from 632,000 in November 2019. An 11% year-on-year increase in subscriptions to print products helped offset the hit from the global pandemic to newsstand sales. We now have a record 119,000 print subscriptions across the Guardian, the Observer and Guardian Weekly. In the 12 months to end of October 2020, the Guardian also received over 530,000 single contributions from readers across the world. Including print subscribers and single contributions, people have supported the Guardian financially more than 1.5m times in the last 12 months.', 'In the past few months, we have started to encourage readers to sign in when they visit the Guardian digitally, so we can remember their preferences, improve their experience of the site, and tailor the messages and advertising they see.', 'Strengthening our relationship with our readers, combined with award-winning journalism that the world needs right now, along with our huge reach globally is how we’ll attract more people to support the Guardian financially by the end of our 200th anniversary.', '2020 has been a year of monumental disruption, tragedy, activism and change. Throughout these disorienting times, we have sought to go beyond simply reporting the news to provide clarity, hold the powerful to account, and bring empathy and humanity to stories that may otherwise go untold.', 'More than ever, our evidence-based journalism and rigorous analysis has sought to be comprehensive, authoritative and calm – allowing Guardian readers to navigate an at times overwhelming volume of information and noise.', 'Coronavirus is one of the biggest and most complex stories of our time, touching on all facets of life – politics, science, the economy, people’s lives and relationships. Throughout, our reporting on the pandemic has been expert and courageous – not only in holding those in power to account for their handling of the crisis, but in bringing warmth and humanity to a bleak period and focusing on the tragic stories of the hundreds of thousands of lives lost around the world.', 'Our numbers: 63% growth in subscribers to Guardian YouTube channels **', 'In the early days of the crisis, our 100 Days series looked closely at the growing international impact of the pandemic and our insightful video explainers and Q&As clearly guided our readers to the facts during an increasingly complicated time. We pivoted our Science Weekly podcast to focus on listeners’ questions about the virus – doubling the podcast’s audience in just a few months. And, as the situation worsened, our Lost to the Virus series and Lost on the Frontline, a Guardian US and Kaiser Health News initiative, highlighted the immense human cost with care and sensitivity. Lost on the Frontline has become the exclusive US data source for Amnesty International’s initiative to track deaths of global healthcare workers from Covid-19. The series also influenced the Frontline Heroes Act, a proposed legislation in the US Congress to provide support for the families of fallen healthcare workers and was referenced by Senator Ron Wyden during a hearing about the national PPE shortage.', 'We have never lost sight of the importance in holding the powerful to account for their role in managing the crisis. Within the Guardian’s investigations team we established a coronavirus investigations wing, publishing a string of exclusives. We uncovered who attends the secret scientific Sage advisory group – and revealed Boris Johnson’s then chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, attended meetings. We revealed the private firm running the UK PPE stockpile, Movianto, was sold in the middle of the pandemic and in a joint exclusive with ITV revealed chaotic conditions at Movianto’s warehouse, which resulted in delays in deploying vital supplies to UK healthcare workers. Our in-depth piece looking at missed opportunities pre-lockdown, the inside story of herd immunity and behind-the-scenes tussles between scientists and politicians was a comprehensive picture of the UK’s missteps. More recently, our journalists unpicked the allegations of “chumocracy” at the heart of the pandemic response, with a series of revelatory stories. In opinion, we discussed the government’s secret Covid contracts.', 'Most notable was our sensational exclusive (with the Daily Mirror) on Cummings’ lockdown trip, which provoked national outrage and created the biggest crisis in trust for the UK government in recent years. The scoop forced Cummings to explain his actions in a Downing Street garden press conference and led the prime minister to make the extraordinary claim that his senior adviser had done nothing wrong and that people needed to ‘move on’ despite millions of people having abided by the rules.', 'As both Johnson and Donald Trump succumbed to the virus, we closely covered the news of the president’s Covid diagnosis, hospitalisation, bizarre joyride, and his contagious inner circle. And we looked at how Johnson’s diagnosis, denials and admissions took the nation on an emotional rollercoaster.', 'We challenged Trump’s claims that hydroxychloroquine was a “miracle cure” drug and revealed how the leader of a group peddling bleach as a coronavirus cure wrote to the president the week before he promoted disinfectant as a possible treatment. We improved and continue to update our coronavirus trackers and UK regional breakdowns, providing a valuable service to our readers over many months. And, following a reader callout, our science team answered questions about the pandemic covering everything from vaping to vaccines.', 'We focused on its effect on young people with a new project – the Covid Generation – telling their stories, from missed education to the toll on mental health, through powerful words, portraits and their own lockdown drawings. We also provided hope by sharing practical and positive stories in series such as Guardian Australia’s The Good Place, the young entrepreneurs defying lockdown, and Anywhere but Westminster’s lockdown specials.', 'Our correspondents around the globe contributed to our coronavirus coverage and our understanding of how different countries tackled the pandemic, from Iran – a country in the grip of one of the worst outbreaks – to how Venezuela used the crisis as a cover to crack down on dissent. From the plight of tourists trapped in a Tenerife hotel, to the eerily empty streets of Milan and the desperation of Covid sufferers in Beijing.', 'We looked at the scandal of the Ruby Princess in Australia and the British holidaymakers stuck on cruise ships unable to dock. We followed the quarantine of Melbourne and the easing of restrictions, including a fantastic First Dog cartoon and a look at how Melbourne residents embraced their first day of freedom.', 'Our coverage of the pandemic was also recognised as some of the most trusted among the major news brands. Oxford University’s Reuters Institute for Journalism cited the Guardian as doing the best job of all the papers among UK media outlets, and ranked us as the second most visited UK news site for coronavirus updates, second only to the BBC. A separate Survation study also named the Guardian as the most trusted UK paper on the topic.', 'Outside of the pandemic, the other major global story of 2020 has been the Black Lives Matter movement. Our coverage since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on 25 May has been urgent, thought-provoking and clear in what has been a deeply personal and emotionally charged moment for so many. With journalists located around the world, we have been able to provide a unique and intimate perspective on the worldwide protest movement for justice.', 'In the US, we reported, often under difficult conditions, on the protests for justice, incidents of police brutality and counter-demonstrations by racist militias. We investigated how communities of colour are enduring three crises at once: endemic police violence, Covid-19, and an economic crisis threatening jobs and livelihoods. Our coverage explored the history of brutal police violence and systemic racism in the US, and the institutional reforms needed to make a meaningful difference. Our journalists reported on these events, and the broader social and political questions they beg, with clarity, authority and purpose. We raised the voices of protesters, armed our readers with the facts, and provided wide-ranging perspectives on the government response. We profiled the black-led groups leading the calls for justice, the families directly affected by police brutality and asked what it really means to ”defund the police”. We exposed how structural poverty and enduring racism in the deep South has a direct impact on the deaths of black Americans from Covid-19, and our exclusive piece on the impacts of global heating further revealed how black and brown neighbourhoods would be unequally affected. Our interview with Bubba Wallace, Nascar’s only black driver, revealed rapidly changing attitudes to race in the sport.', 'In Australia, we continue to focus on Indigenous Australians and the injustices they experience. We broke stories on outrages involving the mining company Rio Tinto, reporting on the firm’s decision to blow up a sacred Aboriginal site and the flawed legislation that allowed it. Our reporting ultimately led to the resignation of Rio Tinto’s CEO and senior executives as well as a parliamentary inquiry recommending a moratorium on any destruction of potential heritage sites until laws are passed in the new year. Our multiple award-winning Deaths Inside series, which has examined every Indigenous death in custody since 2008, continued to uncover stories of injustice this year. Images of protesters, who marched in cities and towns around Australia in support of Black Lives Matter, cited our Deaths Inside project and our investigations into the death of David Dungay Jnr to highlight systemic racism in Australia.', 'In light of the toppling of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol, we reported from communities across the UK. Our Young, British and Black series highlighted 50 voices of this generation and we launched a powerful Black Lives series that looked at the extraordinary stories of the people at the forefront of social change and civil rights. And, to celebrate Black History Month, we produced an interactive timeline documenting two millennia of world-shaping individuals and momentous events that define black history and gave away glossy wallcharts with the newspaper.', 'Our opinion writers also covered the shocking global implications and big new ideas emerging from the crisis in The World Turned Upside Down series, and highlighted the renewed urgency of anti-racist movements in America and the UK in columns by Patricia Williams on George Floyd’s killing, and Afua Hirsch on racism built in Britain.', 'Although coronavirus has dominated the news in the UK, we’ve continued to report rigorously on other stories that are affecting people’s lives.', 'On 31 January, we marked Brexit eve, capturing the mood of the nation, from Westminster to West Yorkshire. We wrote about the pain thousands of our readers felt and published our “Missing You Already” supplement, which included a moving series of letters to the UK from key cultural figures, generating an appreciative response from our readers.', 'Away from Brexit, our reporting has captured the complexities of the coronavirus pandemic, a multitude of government U-turns, tumultuous party politics and reflected a determination to capture the hidden effects of an unprecedented year.', 'With input from thousands of pupils, teachers and parents via our communities team, we led the way in our reporting on the GCSE and A-levels fiasco – from our exclusive forecast that 40% of A-level results would be downgraded to revealing that the chair of Ofqual threatened to quit unless the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, publicly backed him.', 'In business, we went back undercover at Sports Direct and discovered that question marks remain over the chain’s treatment of staff. We also covered the dramatic events as two of Britain’s biggest retailers collapsed – the demise of Philip Green’s empire and, the following day, of Debenhams. Off the back of Guardian reporting that consistently called for organisations such as Tesco to review their stance on rate rebates, big supermarket chains changed their positions and repaid hundreds of millions to the treasury.', 'Our coverage of the EHRC’s damning report into antisemitism in the Labour party was detailed and revelatory, including our scoop revealing the key insights the day before the report was released. And – in the same week – we published a letter signed by more than 800 legal figures, accusing the government of dangerous rhetoric and calling for an immediate apology.', 'As footballer Marcus Rashford’s campaign to end child food poverty captured the public’s imagination, we spoke to the families dependent on free school meals. And it was inspiring for us to read that Rashford was driven to campaign for free school meals after reading an article in the Guardian.', 'And, with the ongoing inquiry into the Grenfell fire – which restarted in September 2020, 28 months since it began – we continued to highlight this hugely important story, covering the fallouts from the inquiry and speaking with the survivors still seeking justice.', 'Our investigative reporting has continued to expose and uncover injustices across the UK. In March, a critical court judgment into Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum found he had orchestrated the abduction of his two daughters. This was the culmination of a 20-year inquiry that began with a Guardian exclusive. We doggedly followed the long and bitter court battle, which revealed UK police had been deterred from investigating the kidnap.', 'We secured leaked Foreign Office documents, which uncovered that it was No 10 – not the Home Office – driving controversial plans to process asylum seekers in other countries.', 'We have also maintained our focus on previous Guardian exclusives. Since the Guardian exposed the scandal of the wrongful deportation of Commonwealth citizens from the Caribbean in 2018, the Windrush debate continued with our reporting on the number of people entitled to compensation who may still be unknown. The EHRC Windrush report was a damning indictment of the hostile environment policy and the seventh critical report arising from our reporting.', 'We reported on a public inquiry into undercover policing, which launched in November – six years after it was first announced. The inquiry was a result of a Guardian investigation revealing how police covertly monitored the campaign for justice over the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence. It followed years of disclosures uncovered by the Guardian and by the activists who had been the victims of spying.', 'In the US, the Guardian has continued to deliver deep and impactful journalism during a year in which the country’s social, economic and political fabric was dramatically challenged. We repeatedly broke news on the Trump administration’s constant departure from norms, starting with the anger and divisiveness of his state of the union address, shortly followed by Nancy Pelosi’s electrifying response.', 'A key strand of our election coverage was our year-long Fight to Vote series – which launched in 2019. It assessed the many ways Americans are denied the fundamental right to vote, and included an ambitious ballot-tracking exercise. Our piece on Trump’s admission that he was undermining the US Postal Service to make it harder to vote by mail was cited in a lawsuit against the USPS. The project continues to deliver essential reporting on Trump’s attempts to defy the election outcome.', 'In February, we detailed how the president survived impeachment and reflected on a decade in which America swung from the hope of the Obama era to the nihilism and misogyny of Trump. We chronicled the Democratic primaries and reported on Kamala Harris’s memorable challenge to Joe Biden’s race record.', 'Our numbers: +100 million page views to the Guardian’s US election live results tracker **', 'We followed the twists and turns as the Republican party rushed to fill the supreme court seat left open after the death of Ruth Bader Ginsberg. An exclusive Guardian investigation revealed that Amy Coney Barrett – Trump’s now-confirmed supreme court justice – was involved with a secretive Christian group, a story cited by the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, in his attack on the media. Our reporting on Coney Barrett’s anti-abortion stance was referenced by Senator Richard Blumenthal, who credited the Guardian for making key information public while questioning Barrett during the hearings.', 'Our election explainers – including the inventive Build Your Own Election and how the electoral college helps the Republicans, enabled readers to visualise paths to victory for both candidates. Our live election results tracker was a monumental success and, along with our round the clock live blog, was a cornerstone of our coverage. Almost a year in planning, the tracker broke all traffic records, becoming the Guardian’s most viewed page ever, culminating in more than 100m page views in election week. It formed part of a record-breaking week for the Guardian overall, with more than 190m page views and 52.9m unique browsers worldwide within 24 hours.', 'Our Today in Focus special US election episode took listeners through the momentous night moving from New York to Florida, Arizona to Pennsylvania and trying to make sense of what happened. After the election result was eventually called, we profiled the president-elect, looking at how Biden styled himself as the antithesis of Trumpism and at the election of Kamala Harris, the first woman of colour to be voted vice-president.', 'Outside of politics, our journalists followed the sexual assault and rape trial of the disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein. As a guilty verdict was handed down, we broke the news before other major news organisations, and documented his rise and fall, the key moments of the trial, the six women at the heart of the trial and how it divided the #MeToo movement.', 'In December, we also joined a global consortium to continue the work of murdered Mexican journalists. In collaboration with 24 international media outlets across 18 countries, and coordinated by Forbidden Stories, the Cartel Project investigates the global networks of Mexican drug cartels and their political connections around the world.', 'Our reporting has also focused on society, culture and lifestyle. Our State of Men series took a hard look at what it means to be male in 2020. In a similar vein, we launched Childfree, a series in which women spoke openly about their decisions to not have children. And our pandemic epiphanies series centred on positive stories on what writers and readers discovered about themselves during the pandemic. Our series Trans Freedom Fighters shone a light on the trans and non-binary leaders on the frontlines of 2020 organising and activism in the US.', 'Our brilliant reporting of the massive Australian bushfires continued into 2020, as the devastating fires continued to burn across vast areas of the country. In the most devastating bushfire season ever, our small team closely followed events as conditions worsened, from Mallacoota beach to Bairnsdale, where conditions on the ground proved most devastating. Our analysis of the fires and the failure of the prime minister to act, or even acknowledge the connection to the climate crisis, shocked the world. Our innovative visual explainer showed how the 2020 fires are very different from those in previous years with an exclusive story revealing how the Australian government approved a Chinese company to run a water mining operation in drought-stricken Queensland.', 'Our political reporting in Australia has exposed significant flaws, consistently holding the government to account.', 'Our dogged coverage of the robodebt scandal culminated in November 2020 with a $1.2b payout to 400,000 victims. We revealed how the coalition government believed it had no duty of care for welfare recipients, and also exposed the questionable $400k grant given to an aged care home operator when others missed out.', 'The New South Wales corruption tribunal was gripping, and exposed how the state premier, Gladys Berejiklian, had been in a secret relationship with a disgraced former MP, with excellent commentary on the fallout and unanswered questions.', 'We continued our scrutiny of the government’s role in the climate emergency. In our Green Recovery series in May, we highlighted how there were many ways stimulus spending might have also hastened the transition to a low-carbon economy, but the government didn’t take up those options and the year ends with Australia’s climate policy debate still stuck in an endless loop of political rhetoric, but under increasingly critical scrutiny from the rest of the world.', 'Facebook has apologised for defamatory posts about an Australian politician – it was not even prepared to delete the posts until Guardian Australia reported on the case in August.', 'We also explored how Australia is starting to recognise coalmining might not be viable long term, including an exclusive on the private investigator working for the controversial Adani mine who secretly spied on and photographed an activist’s family. We also exclusively revealed a photograph of an Australian soldier drinking beer from a prosthetic leg thought to belong to a Taliban fighter killed by special forces in Afghanistan.', 'And finally, The Wait series gave a voice to people and places that may otherwise go unheard, telling the story of the forgotten refugees stranded in Indonesia as a result of Australia’s border crackdowns.', 'Guardian Australia has led the reporting on many of these local stories and will continue to pursue them, because facts and accountability matter, for good public policy and to shore up citizens’ trust in the political system.', 'At the start of the year, our groundbreaking scoop revealed that Jeff Bezos had his phone hacked by the Saudi crown prince. This was a truly astonishing exposé that Politico called ”the Guardian’s mega-scoop – a genuine marmalade-dropper”. The story had an immediate and far-reaching impact, and was followed up all over the world.', 'The New Zealand election was another huge moment; from the details of Jacinda Ardern’s win and possible coalition to our reporting on the broader political picture on why the country does not respond to populism in ways other countries do.', 'We ran a series of deeply moving pieces to mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, including a beautiful dispatch from the memorial ceremony. We also spoke with survivors who returned to the camp for the anniversary in a series of heart-wrenching interviews, including on Today in Focus.', 'Our This is Europe series featured many memorable stories — from our exclusive on the EU’s support for vulnerable EU nationals to remain in the UK, and research on rising support for Eurosceptic parties, to a collection of European critics’ responses to UK culture. We launched Europeans – a series of seven new films from across Europe and revealed how Europe’s demographic map is being reshaped from Germany to Spain.', 'We focused on the profound changes taking place in Hong Kong in our Fight for Hong Kong series. Our Today in Focus podcast featured the pro-democracy activist Nathan Law, and a fantastic video followed a Hong Kong journalist working for a pro-democracy newspaper in the shadow of China’s controversial national security law.', 'Our exclusive report on how Jordan became the country with the highest smoking rates in the world focused on claims of big tobacco interference and undue political influence – resulting in swift government interventions by banning indoor smoking across the country.', 'August’s explosion in Beirut was one of the world’s largest non-nuclear blasts. We covered the explosion with on-the-ground coverage, witness accounts and explainers. We later told the stories of the people caught up in the blast in an extraordinary interactive using footage survivors captured on their smartphones.', 'As protests continued in Belarus over the re-election of Alexander Lukashenko, a Guardian documentary followed three independent Belarusian film-makers as they turned their cameras on themselves and their communities. The photo of a protester holding up a sign inspired by a striking Guardian Weekly cover serves as a reminder that our journalism provides hope to many in the face of injustices.', 'And, as the Nigerian government was accused of clamping down on one of the most striking protest movements for decades, we looked at the protests against police violence and the anti-robbery squad (Sars) that have swept the country.', 'In what was a particularly disrupted year for sport, our journalism has remained as important and impactful as ever.', 'In November, our coverage of Diego Maradona’s death was quick, thoughtful, visually strong and properly international. The package of pieces curated by Sachin Nakrani included a fine appreciation by Jonathan Wilson and a superb piece by Marcela Mora y Araujo on Maradona’s meaning to Argentina.', 'Our exclusive investigation, which began in April, into allegations of sexual abuse of girls and young women by the president of the Haiti FA, Yves Jean-Bart, led in November to him being banned for life by Fifa, showcasing the impact of Guardian journalism.', 'Earlier in the year, we reported on the funding struggles of sports clubs and associations, revealing how UK Athletics fought to renew its TV deal with the BBC, and exposing plans to slash funding by 50% for second-tier English rugby union clubs.', 'We were at the forefront of reporting on Manchester City’s two-year ban from the Champions League, followed with exclusives on the club’s funding and a possible further investigation. And we broke two major athletics stories – on claims of neglect in British athletics and the tussle over Nike’s Vaporfly running shoes.', 'During the lockdown, our Football Weekly podcast grew its audience, despite no football taking place, and produced thoughtful specials on the “gamblification” of the sport, and on racism in football and mental health.', 'The impact of Black Lives Matter reverberated throughout the sporting world too. We ran pieces on the lack of BAME representation in sport leadership, while our Sportblog provided some powerful opinion pieces, including Michael Holding and Ebony Rainford-Brent’s broadcast on cricket and Black Lives Matter.', 'Over the summer, our series on the greatest tennis players of the last 50 years delivered an excellent response, with thousands of replies to our callout. In September, the US Open was notable for Novak Djokovic’s disqualification and the rise of Naomi Osaka.', 'Coverage of the collapse of the Newcastle United takeover was revelatory and nuanced, as was our report on the shocking allegations of abuse in British gymnastics. Our feature on how Jürgen Klopp transformed Liverpool provided great insights, as did our exclusive interview with Liverpool’s title-winning captain, Jordan Henderson.', 'In October, our exclusive investigation revealed how much the FA chairman, Greg Clarke, and the Premier League knew, but did not admit, about secret Operation Big Picture talks. We also explored how the plans did not go far enough for women’s football. One of our Sportblog pieces was hailed by Gary Lineker as “the most sensible and balanced comment piece I’ve read on this by far”. In November, Clarke resigned after a disastrous select committee appearance, while our guide to the US golf Masters provided much-needed cheer. We were also the first to report on a revelatory film about Liverpool and Klopp and featured a vivid interview with the boxer Bilal Fawaz.', 'During the past year we’ve continued to report on every aspect of the environment – publishing a piece of environmental journalism roughly every three hours. In October, we renewed our commitment to readers, pledging to keep reporting on the climate emergency, raising the alarm and investigating the crisis and possible solutions. As part of this commitment we launched our environmental dashboard, which tracks a selection of the planet’s vital signs, from carbon dioxide levels to Arctic sea ice, providing a visual representation of the growing climate crisis.', 'Our Last Chance series looked at what the world is doing to fight global heating and manage a green recovery and our exclusive analysis revealed that Covid recovery plans are threatening climate hopes.', 'US congressmen Peter A Defazio and Matt Gaetz cited the importance of the Guardian piece “The secretive government agency planting ‘cyanide bombs’ across the US” – part of our This Land is Your Land series – in a letter they sent to Congress.', 'As evidence of increased global heating accumulates, we investigated its devastating impact of this around the world. As bushfires burned across vast areas of Australia, our team worked tirelessly to produce outstanding coverage that has had a real impact both in Australia and abroad.', 'As major weather events become more commonplace – from severe wildfires in California to Hurricane Laura – we launched 100 Days to Save the Earth, which took an in-depth look at the ways in which Trump’s presidency has made America dirtier and the planet warmer following his withdrawal from the US from the Paris agreement. As part of a year-long series on America’s water crisis, with partner Consumer Reports, our landmark investigation revealed how millions of ordinary Americans are facing unaffordable bills for running water. A piece by our US editor asked whether it was too much to ask for Americans to have access to clean water in 2020.', 'Our numbers: +20% growth in increase in average monthly unique browsers to environmental reporting **', 'Following the Guardian’s Polluters series, which revealed the firms behind a third of all carbon emissions, in January 2020 we announced that the Guardian would not accept advertising from fossil fuel extractive companies. This announcement sent a signal to encourage other companies to follow our lead, increasing the pressure on oil companies, miners and other extractive industries to change course. Our exclusive on the vast profits made by big oil since 1990 served as a timely reminder of their role in the escalating climate emergency. And, in the lead-up to Davos, Greta Thunberg and other climate strikers wrote for us urging world leaders to abandon the fossil fuel economy.', 'Despite it being a tricky year for in-person interviews, we’ve still featured some fantastic names – Tom Hanks on surviving coronavirus, Black Lives Matter founder Alicia Garza on stepping away from the movement she helped create, the warm and irrepressible Miriam Margolyes and Samuel L Jackson on roots, race and revolution, Helena Bonham Carter on divorce, Pierce Brosnan on life after Bond and a hilarious Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.

Our upbeat Black Lives series has been an inspiring insight into people at the forefront of social change and civil rights.', 'Our interview with Andre Leon Talley, former creative director of US Vogue, dug deep into the ruthlessness at the heart of the fashion industry. As part of Weekend’s graduate special – class of 2020 – Victoria Beckham answered questions from fashion students on personal style, the Spice Girls and fashion after corona.', 'We continued to give a voice and a platform to women alleging sexual assault. In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein verdict, Rose McGowan spoke to us about how her fight for justice cost her motherhood and a career, but sparked a movement and brought a prolific offender to justice.', 'Weekend featured an exclusive interview with Amy Dorris – a former model who alleges Trump forced his tongue down her throat and groped her at 1997 US Open. Model Linda Evangelista spoke exclusively to the Guardian in support of four women who for the first time shared their stories of sexual assault or rape by her ex-husband, former Elite Models boss Gérald Marie. The story followed our compelling investigation into Trump’s involvement with the Elite Look of the Year contest.', 'In our world exclusive with Elena Ferrante, the author answered questions from translators and booksellers, covering everything from coronavirus to therapy and we featured an exclusive extract from the late Clive James’ final book on the meaning of poetry in his life.', 'As the long-awaited book in her Thomas Cromwell trilogy was published, we spoke exclusively to Hilary Mantel and published the very first extract of The Mirror & the Light. Four years after leaving office, we spoke with Barack Obama about Trump, Biden and what the future holds for America, and also featured an extract of his new book.', 'We published a moving long read on the fate of people deported from the UK to countries where they have no family or support as well as a beautiful piece on the closure of a high street butcher’s shop after four generations in one family. We looked into the battle to overthrow the Tampax empire, reviewed the evidence – or lack of it – in the unsolved mystery of the Gatwick drone and examined how the previously little-known Zoom is now being used by everyone from princes to piano teachers.', 'We looked into the race to produce human breast milk in a lab, asking how liberating this might be for new mothers, and featured a moving account of the reality of a second lockdown with terminal cancer.', 'Our piece about the quilters of Alabama was a fascinating look at how their masterpieces can be viewed as tokens of solace and defiance in tragic times.

In our staycation special, comedians shared their worst trips and, after Blind date went temporarily virtual, we were thrilled to see it back in the wild.', 'Philanthropic funding supports impactful, mission-driven reporting projects at the Guardian. Our projects are often timely, but none more so this year than the Fight to Vote series, which was supported by foundations including Craig Newmark Philanthropies and the Park Foundation. This series launched a year before the US presidential election and was a critical anchor of our election coverage. With philanthropic support for a dedicated editorial team, reporting from the series established the role of Republican suppression tactics and the campaign to undermine election integrity long before the election. The Guardian was first to cover the shift to mail-in voting, the role of USPS, and Trump’s false claims of widespread voter fraud, and broke many stories, including one on dark money behind voting restrictions and the Trump campaign’s first failed attempts to prove voter fraud.', 'Similarly, the Age of Extinction series supported by the BAND Foundation and the Wyss Foundation – which reports on the global biodiversity catastrophe – has ensured that our interconnectedness with nature and its critical role in our own existence has remained a front-and-centre consideration among policymakers across the world dealing with the Covid outbreak, including the UN and the UK government.', 'Support from an array of funders including Humanity United, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Packard Foundation, Open Philanthropy Project and the 11th Hour Fund continues to make possible in-depth and vital storytelling on a range of environmental issues, such as the global impact of intensive farming practices, the dramatic changes taking place in our oceans, and the ongoing damages to our public lands. Award-winning reporting on global inequality, poverty, and human rights will continue in the years ahead, with expanded support for the series on labour exploitation and modern slavery and the continuation of the global development site. We have seen immense impact across our projects, all of which are contributing to delivering change at a policy level as well as creating a lasting impact for the individuals affected by the issues.', 'An incredible special report in the Observer on the Femicide Census, about the number of women killed by men every year was a truly shocking story, opening up the discussion on violence towards women. It came not long after readers expressed concern about the Guardian publishing an obituary of the convicted rapist and murderer Peter Sutcliffe – a sensitive topic covered by our readers’ editor in a thoughtful column, in addition to reporting of his victims and their stories.', 'In the run up to the US election, the Observer continued to dissect the role of Facebook and the potential issues the platform could cause for Biden, including two powerful interviews with the whistleblower Yaël Eisenstat and early investor Roger McNamee. A deep dive into Facebook also looked at the pivotal role the platform would play in the US elections.', 'In July, the Observer revealed how pressure from Donald Trump led to the British government banning the Chinese technology giant Huawei from its 5G telecoms network. And, the Observer also led on the story that the same controversial algorithm that sparked the UK’s A-level results fiasco was to set 97% of GCSE results.', 'A year on from the death of Jack Merritt in the London Bridge attack, his family, friends and ex-offenders spoke to Observer New Review about Jack’s work transforming prisoners’ lives.', 'After seven weeks in intensive care, the author Michael Rosen spoke exclusively to the Observer about his experience of having coronavirus, and Glenda Jackson discussed how she considers herself an anti-social socialist in a revealing interview in the Observer Magazine.', 'The Black Lives Matter movement was a prominent inspiration for Observer journalism. We invited leading black British poets including Linton Kwesi Johnson, Grace Nichols and Raymond Antrobus to share thoughts on protest, change and the trailblazers who inspired them in the New Review. In a frank interview with the Observer magazine, Naomi Campbell lambasted the fashion industry for only becoming vocal about racism since the rise of Black Lives Matter. The star of the film Clemency, Alfre Woodard spoke to Observer New Review about the US prison system, her enslaved great-grandfather and her hopes for Black Lives Matter.', 'In a noisy media landscape, Guardian US stands out by providing a global perspective on American events and issues. Our reporters are rooted in communities across the country – with bureaux on the East Coast, including New York and Washington DC, the West Coast and in the South – and our vision is to continue to expand our coverage across the US.', '2020 has been a momentous year. From the Trump administration’s mishandling of the pandemic, to the atrocious killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others that led to the powerful resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement, and a dramatic US election – our journalism has been authoritative and courageous. In this year of extraordinary upheaval, we’ve shared wide-ranging perspectives, elevated underrepresented voices, challenged controversial decisions on the climate crisis, and held the powerful to account.', 'Reporting a presidential election in the midst of a pandemic presented new and interesting challenges for our news desk. A virtual newsroom replaced a crowded office. Major decisions were made via instant messaging instead of across desk dividers. Reporters were equipped with PPE to ensure they could do their jobs safely. What did not change was our commitment to be in as many places as possible, and speak to as many people as we could.', 'From our supporters: Thank you so much for both covering terrible news incidents, and reporting about them in a way that speaks for peace and justice. I’m not black. I am Cuban-American and I trust the Guardian to report the news with a good heart, being honest and balanced.

Our non-stop journalism drove record breaking traffic: on Wednesday 4 November, the day after the election, the Guardian recorded its highest-ever digital traffic, reaching more than 190m page views and 53m unique browsers worldwide in 24 hours, exceeding all previous traffic records by a huge margin. The Guardian’s live results tracker alone received more than 100m page views in election week and we also reached a larger number of Guardian readers in the US than ever before – 165m page views from 70m unique browsers in the month of November.', 'Just as the Black Lives Matter movement in the US, and the global reckoning it spurred, defined much of our coverage this year, it also inspired us to look inward and assess how we could improve our own diversity, equity and inclusion, to ensure we better reflect the communities we serve and allow for a more diverse range of perspectives. In addition to the Guardian’s global commitments to anti-racism, in the US we made explicit commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion that involved changing our newsroom practices and systems to make them more equitable, and building a more equal culture.', 'The degrading treatment of journalists by law enforcement, encouraged by political cheerleaders, is another deeply troubling aspect of these events. And our journalists have been reporting up close, at personal risk, to make sure millions of readers around the world can see for themselves what’s taking place. Throughout the year, Donald Trump continued to peddle disinformation, not just about the integrity of the news media, as he had done for the previous four years, but this time about coronavirus. Most notable was the misinformation he spread around the level of danger it posed and potential cures. As his daily coronavirus briefings became a platform for lies, campaigning and denials, Guardian political reporters were there, interrogating his claims and arming readers the facts, prioritising public safety in a way the administration was not.', 'From our supporters: I would like to congratulate the Guardian on the depth and breadth of the coverage over last week in relation to the election … thanks for the excellent journalism you continue to provide which is why I have no hesitation in continuing to subscribe to the paper. Louis Boyle, a reader in County Down, Northern Ireland **', 'We continue to reject climate denial rhetoric, doubling down on our commitments to the environment both in our reporting and as an organisation. In America, we joined forces with hundreds of newsrooms to promote climate solutions as part of Covering Climate Now. We also invited first-time voters to take over the Guardian homepage as part of climate week. Beyond our partnership with CCN, we collaborated with other like-minded partners to go deeper and further on stories that matter to Americans. We teamed up with Kaiser Health News to launch Lost on the Frontline – an interactive documenting every healthcare worker lost to Covid – and we launched America’s Water Crisis with Consumer Reports to investigate the challenges many in the US face getting access to safe, clean, affordable water.', 'Our base of recurring supporters also hit a milestone this year, surpassing 150,000 in August. This extraordinary growth is something we value deeply and which allows us to continue the essential reporting we do. This support was matched by an outpouring of generosity during our end-of-year campaign last year. Each year, we set an ambitious target to raise money for our journalism. In our 2019-20 end-of-year appeal, we raised $1.5m from more than 30,000 readers in every state across America.', 'This year, our new partnership with Apple News also introduced millions more Americans to Guardian journalism. The US business has continued to grow steadily, contributing positively to the Guardian as a whole.', 'Guardian US will continue to cover the stories that matter in America, with ever more readers and supporters who believe in our unique perspective, our business model and our editorial purpose.

Appreciation for Guardian Australia’s coverage was reflected in strong audience growth and record financial support.', 'Shortly after, the outbreak of Covid-19 propelled audience growth to record levels. The number of unique browsers increased by 104% in March alone to 11.6 million, making Guardian Australia the country’s fourth most popular news site. By August, several months into the pandemic, audience numbers remained high at 7.4 million, a year-on-year increase of 72%, cementing Guardian Australia’s position as the country’s leading progressive news brand.', 'From our supporters: To me, Guardian Australia is one of the last bastions of independent journalism in this country. It is essential to any democracy that we have a free and independent press. They hold those in power to account, interrogate issues and inform the masses. The Guardian does those things for me. Charmaine, a reader in Victoria, Australia', 'Throughout the turbulent and challenging events of 2020, Guardian Australia’s stretched newsroom still managed to produce a series of distinctive, in-depth journalistic projects. The Frontline series took readers inside Australia’s lived experience of climate change, from new bushfire zones to disappearing underwater forests, while The Green Recovery series explored the environmental opportunities in Australia’s post-pandemic recovery. The Full Story podcast is continuing to grow strongly and was recognised at the 2020 Australian Podcast Awards, winning silver in the best current affairs podcast category, and bronze in the best documentary podcast category.', 'In partnership with the University of NSW, Guardian Australia introduced Temporary, a narrative podcast series that tells the stories of refugees stuck in legal limbo in Australia.

For their coverage of Rio Tinto’s destruction of Juukan Gorge cave, a sacred Indigenous site in Western Australia, Lorena Allam and Calla Wahlquist won the Walkley award for coverage of Indigenous affairs.', 'Guardian Australia’s latest series, Dreams interrupted, investigates how the pandemic is shaping a generation of young Australians who now find themselves in a recession that will have an outsized impact on the trajectory of their lives. The series, funded by the Barlow Foundation, will also explore how it is that so many Indigenous children are in jail, and how the disruptions of 2020 can give rise to an environmentally friendly recovery.', 'In Australia, the challenges to journalism from many quarters are unrelenting – perpetual job losses, the reduction in the number of regional news outlets and cuts to the public broadcaster. In the face of these conditions, Guardian Australia made a concerted effort to grow its community to 150,000 supporters. The fundraiser was the first premised on supporting Guardian Australia itself, rather than distinct editorial projects, and was highly successful. The target was surpassed ahead of schedule, and several innovative features were launched, including an interactive map to display messages from supporters across the country.', 'Our numbers: 150,000 community of supporters across Australia **', 'Amid the softening Covid-19 advertising market, Guardian Australia was bolstered by philanthropic support from VivCourt, the Judith Neilson Institute and the Limb Family Foundation. Meanwhile, a grant from the Balnaves Foundation helped fund a dedicated arts reporter for three years, and a grant confirmed from the Barlow Impact Group will fund three upcoming projects on youth inequality.

Our values – of honesty, integrity, courage, fairness, and a sense of duty to the reader and the community – are likewise reflected in our people, culture and organisational impact.', 'Coronavirus brought a year of extraordinary change to working practices for Guardian employees around the world. We responded quickly to the pandemic, shifting the majority of our workforce to remote working – with only very small groups of essential staff producing the website and newspaper from our offices in London. We have been forced to rethink our ways of working, adapt to the virtual world and overcome the challenges of keeping our teams connected with one another.', 'Coronavirus has also accelerated many of the long-term trends affecting the news industry and, like many other titles, several areas of our business have faced financial pressures. In July 2020, we announced that we would need to restructure a number of areas, which sadly included job losses, meaning a number of valued colleagues left the organisation this year.', 'Inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, many organisations, including the Guardian, have had to recognise that there is still much work for us to do. People from different backgrounds have different perspectives on what makes “news” and we recognise our employees need to reflect the audiences we serve. We have made some advances in diversifying the Guardian in recent years, but we need to accelerate our efforts so we are better equipped to produce more meaningful and more impactful journalism.', 'Working collaboratively with our People of Colour groups based in the UK and US, we announced a company-wide commitment to anti-racism and plans to improve representation of black, Asian and minority ethnic people throughout the organisation. This work culminated in a comprehensive race action plan that looks closely at how we operate across all levels of the company; from hiring to remuneration, training to career progression. We commissioned Marcus Ryder, an expert on media diversity, to review our target of at least 20% black, Asian, minority ethnic (BAME) representation across the organisation, and to make recommendations for department-specific goals.', 'Our efforts in this space have also involved reflecting on the Guardian’s history. In July, the Scott Trust commissioned research on the Guardian’s founding moments to identify any connections – direct or indirect – with the slave trade. The work will be carried out independently by the University of Nottingham’s Institute for the Study of Slavery, and will investigate any links between the Guardian’s founder, John Edward Taylor, his associates, their investments and/or business activities with historical transatlantic slavery.', 'These commitments build on work we have already done. In December 2019, we released our first UK ethnicity pay gap report – one of only a small number of media organisations to do so. The ethnicity pay report is an extension of the yearly reporting we already do on our gender pay gap reporting and identifies key areas of focus.', 'We have continued the important work of our employee-led diversity and inclusion forum to secure a consistent and strategic approach to drive real change across the business. This year, we signed up to the Business in the Community Race at Work charter, implementing the five calls to action.

In May, we held a week of events and workshops to mark Mental Health Awareness Week in the UK, and have since launched new workshops on mental health for line managers and employees across the organisation. We continue to provide free employee assistance programmes in the UK, US and Australia, and on-demand resources to promote strong mental health.', 'We show our commitment to tackle the climate crisis in three key ways – through sustained world-leading environmental journalism; through measuring our own carbon emissions and by working with our employees to make significant changes and lead by example.

Greta Thunberg, Naomi Klein, Greenpeace, Extinction Rebellion and Global Witness publicly supported our landmark decision and readers were delighted when we told them the news.', 'In October 2020, we announced new climate commitments and launched further editorial and business initiatives, including a climate data dashboard. Our climate plan has been informed by a full audit of greenhouse gas emissions from Guardian Media Group’s direct and indirect emissions, with newspaper production and our print supply chain the biggest contributors to the Guardian’s carbon footprint. We renewed our environmental commitments in a letter to readers, with an ambitious business goal of eliminating at least two-thirds of our total emissions by 2030. In 2020, our employee sustainability forum supported the development of our Climate Pledge 2020 and our promise to prioritise the escalating climate crisis in our journalism and our business decisions.', 'Our commitment to the environment has also been widely recognised. In 2020, the Guardian was awarded the first sustainability strategy of the year award at the Newspaper & Magazine Awards, in October we were named winner in the business transformation category at the Reuters Responsible Business Awards, and in November we won the prestigious BBVA Foundation Biophilia Award for Environmental Communication for the Guardian’s environmental reporting, which the foundation said had had a “transformative impact” in the global community.', 'Through the Scott Trust, our independent charity the Guardian Foundation supports media under threat, promotes diversity in the media and empowers children and young people to engage with the news.

The results are inspiring – after taking part in the programme, twice as many pupils were able to tell whether a news story was real or fake (from 32.7% to 67.2%) and pupils were more than twice as likely to feel able to tell if a news source was trustworthy (33.3% to 82.8%).', 'In response to school closures as a result of coronavirus, NewsWise created a family zone with activities, links, tips and advice to help families learn more about the news together, a series of teacher training webinars and the Happy News Project to help primary pupils transition back to school with a focus on wellbeing, with uplifting stories, teamwork, speaking and news writing.

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/06/the-songs-that-saved-the-whales,"['Fifty years ago an album of whale calls became an unlikely global hit and kickstarted the ban on hunting. On the anniversary our writer talks to the US scientist who started it all', 'Roger Payne has played the sounds made by humpback whales to thousands of people – “more than thousands,” he corrects himself – in the past 50 years. He has played sections in schools, in churches, on TV talk shows, at the UN; he’s played them to singers, musicians, politicians and other scientists. The response is always the same. For the first 30 seconds, there is mumbling, sometimes awkward giggling as the audience gets used to the deep, rumbling groans and high-pitched squeaks (this is when the TV shows usually cut it off).', 'But leave it longer – at least five minutes, ideally half an hour – and Payne finds a strange thing happens. “In that time, the audience would go totally silent,” says the 85-year-old, on a video call from rural Vermont. “You were unaware there was anybody in the room and then, when I killed it, there would be this… inhalation. You would hear people basically coming out of a kind of trance. That was the clue that, ‘This is changing the lives of these people.’ And that’s how I think we’ve got it to really make a difference.”', 'In 1970, Payne led a team that released a five-track, 34-minute album called Songs of the Humpback Whale. To everyone’s surprise – Payne was a bioacoustics expert, not a musician – it became a hit: it sold more than 125,000 copies, making it the most popular nature recording of all time. Pete Seeger and Judy Collins, superstars at the time, wrote songs inspired by the record.', 'When Nasa launched their Golden Record aboard the Voyager spacecraft in 1977, one of Payne’s songs was included on the 12-inch gold-plated disc, along with music from Bach, Mozart and Louis Armstrong. Then, in 1979, an extract from the album was sent to all National Geographic’s 10.5 million subscribers. This made it the largest single pressing in recording history – a record it holds to this day.', 'On the 50th anniversary of Songs of the Humpback Whale, it can be hard to fathom how much has changed in our appreciation of the species. In the 1960s, tens of thousands of whales were slaughtered every year, mainly for soap, oil and pet food. Humpback whales, which numbered around 100,000 in 1900, had been hunted mercilessly and fewer than 7,000 remained. “They were headed towards extinction, no discussion,” says Payne.', 'Payne’s own experience backed up this depressing picture. The first cetacean he ever saw was a dolphin that had washed ashore and died on the coast near Boston, when he was teaching at Tufts University. It was late at night and raining when he found the body. “Some bozo had chopped off its flukes and somebody else had stuffed a cigar butt in its blowhole,” he recalls. “I thought to myself, ‘Is this the only interaction that can occur between people and the wild world?’ I sat there, soaked to the bone, and decided it would be wonderful to do something about this. I had no chance of that at that moment, but a chance slowly appeared.”', 'That “chance” was an encounter in 1967 with a man named Frank Watlington, an engineer for the US Navy, based in Bermuda . Since the 1950s, Watlington had been monitoring a large collection of hydrophones (microphones designed to record underwater sounds) 30 miles off the coast of the island, mainly with the hope of eavesdropping on Soviet submarines. “I never knew what his work was,” says Payne. “It was something secret: state-supported skulduggery in the ocean.”', 'There’s no record of how effective Watlington’s official assignment was but the hydrophones proved to be the perfect tool for listening to humpback whales. We know now that, although many whales use sound to communicate, humpbacks are the only ones that “sing”: it might, on first hearing, sound like one drawn-out moan, but Payne, his first wife Katy and an associate, Scott McVay, proved that there is an intentional rhyme, repetition and structure in the noises.', 'Female humpbacks do some quiet singing, but the loudest, most brazen crooning comes from males during the six-month breeding season. “My guess is that it is an advertising song, an invitation to females: ‘Hey, I’m a handsome dude ready to mate. Where are you baby?’” says Payne. “And the other function is that the sounds they are making would mean a threat: ‘Stay back buster or I’ll bust your ass!’”', 'Either way, Payne realised from the moment that Watlington played him the tapes he had recorded that they had something special. He also knew, as he listened with tears in his eyes, that he potentially had the secret to stopping the massacre of these creatures. “It was dead obvious to me from sound number two or three that this was the most extraordinary thing ever heard in nature,” says Payne. “All I was interested in was trying to get the world to think: ‘Hey, folks, we’re killing off the largest animals that have ever lived in the history of the planet. This is nuts!’ Then here comes this fabulously beautiful thing. Suppose oak trees sang stunningly beautiful songs and you were concerned because oak forests were being levelled.”', 'Songs of the Humpback Whale consisted of three of Watlington’s tracks, and two made by the Paynes. Payne sent out copies to the Beatles, Joan Baez, Bob Dylan: he heard that Dylan would sometimes stop his gigs and play a section of the recording. He met the Welsh singer Mary Hopkin, an early signing to the Beatles’ Apple label, best known for the No 1 single, Those Were The Days. After some initial confusion where she thought it was “the songs of Wales”, Hopkin listened rapt. “She said, ‘That’s the most beautiful sound I’ve ever heard. I wish I could sound that way.’ And of course she had a most beautiful voice.”', 'Payne’s album did inspire a movement, much as he hoped. Support came with the foundation of Greenpeace in 1972, and in particular its Project Ahab in the mid-70s, in which activists parked their boats in front of the whalers’ harpoons. David Attenborough and Jacques Cousteau made popular documentaries focused on the creatures.', 'In 1986, the International Whaling Commission banned commercial whaling for all species, although Iceland, Norway and Japan still issue permits for scientific and commercial whaling. Whale song entered popular culture, becoming the main plot point of the 1986 film Star Trek: the Voyage Home and a gag in The Simpsons, where a college professor tries to woo Marge. And the numbers of whales has rebounded. Humpback whales have come back to pre-whaling populations, perhaps as many as 100,000. (Not all cetaceans have been so lucky: blue and North Atlantic right whales remain endangered.) “My whole thought was if we can build whales into human culture, then we can save them,” says Payne. “And I think that’s happened. Good God, I’m certainly not the one who did all the building. There are thousands, literally thousands of other people who did vast and wonderful things.”', 'A half century on, Payne continues to write and lecture, and he has become involved in a pioneering group that is attempting to use machine learning to decipher what whales are actually saying – and maybe even, eventually, to communicate with them. It’s an outlandish concept but there are some high-powered individuals involved, including Britt Selvitelle, one of the founding team at Twitter, and Aza Raskin, who devised the now ubiquitous “infinite scroll” on webpages.', 'Payne calls the endeavour a “wonderfully crazy thing”, but adds: “I think we have a hell of a good chance of it. Where you get stuff done is where you start mixing fields and discover these people are very close to knowing something I wish to hell I’d known 25 years ago.”', 'Covid-19 has hampered any plans for a proper celebration of Songs of the Humpback Whale’s 50th birthday. But Payne believes that the record, not so fashionable these days, still resonates. “I listen to it frequently and it always hits me hard,” he says. “What is the main conclusion that whales build in your mind? My feeling is humility. Giant hurricanes build humility and so do tornadoes, but there’s nothing that does it better that I’ve ever encountered than a whale. And humility is something we need more experiences of. It’s just: God almighty, what a fabulous world exists around us and how utterly we’re destroying it.”']",['Tim Lewis'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d7da2fd2eba5b69750e2c1fd5a485e9098ec187/0_174_3864_2318/master/3864.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'Humpback whale numbers have recovered to about 100,000 since the hunting ban.

He told the Australian Financial Review that, while Vales Point had been a loss-making business for years, he and Sunset Power International’s co-owner, coal baron Brian Flannery, were experienced hands who would trade “in a smarter and more effective way” and run the plant for at least seven years “if coal-fired power generation continues to be required in NSW”.', 'Five years on, coal power remains comfortably the biggest contributor to the power grid – for at least the next few years – and Vales Point has become a money-printing machine for its owners.', 'Documents released this week showed the scale of their success: a profit after tax last financial year of $134.7m and a dividend of $62m. The year before it was a $96.8m profit and $30m dividend.', 'Not a bad result for an outlay equivalent, as the AFR put it, to the price of a nice suburban home.', 'Of course, the sales price was never a true reflection of the value of the plant. Just two years after the sale, in September 2017, the company revalued Vales Point at $731m, up from $70m a year earlier.', 'In a demonstration of how volatile these paper valuations can be, Sunset Power International says that has now fallen to $221.7m due to a drop in demand for the plant’s electricity, which it blames on the Covid-19 shutdown and a surge in the availability of cheap solar and wind power.', 'St Baker and Flannery’s management may have played a part in the plant’s profitability over the past five years, but timing certainly helped. They bought it just before wholesale power prices spiked due to rising gas prices (linked to the creation of an LNG export market) and the closure of Victoria’s Hazelwood coal plant.', 'The company was handed the plant at a nominal rate despite the state retaining liability for any environmental damage or contamination during the decades in which it was owned by taxpayers. Sunset Power International is responsible for any contamination after 2015 and decommissioning costs, and agreed to put up a $12m guarantee to cover them.', 'There have long been discussions about St Baker buying Flannery’s 50% share of the business, but according to comments made to The Australian this week, that is on hold. They no longer see 2022 as the likely end of the plant’s life – St Baker has previously reportedly suggested it could stay open until 2049 – and continue to push for government support.', 'Most businesses would take government handout if it were available. St Baker has persisted and had success in winning backing even when roadblocks were thrown up.', 'As Guardian Australia reported, Sunset Power International spent considerable effort lobbying the federal government to pay for work to improve Vales Point. It tried and, after a lengthy review by officials, failed to win $14m funding through what was then the Coalition’s main climate policy – the $2.5bn emissions reduction fund – for an upgrade that would have cut emissions from the plant by just 1.3%.', 'While that review was ongoing, the plant was shortlisted for the government’s promised energy underwriting program. The Vales Point upgrade was the only coal project on the list.', 'It eventually fell out of contention for the underwriting program when the government decided it should be administered by the green bank, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which is not in the business of supporting coal projects (though the Coalition is attempting to change the law to make it clear the corporation can support gas, another fossil fuel).', 'With the underwriting route closed, the government went the direct funding route, including a grant of up to $8.7m for the Vales Point upgrade in the October budget.', 'Guardian Australia asked Angus Taylor, the federal energy and emissions reduction minister, why taxpayers were paying for an upgrade of a profitable coal plant, and why Vales Point was receiving a grant where other coal-plant owners were not.', 'A spokesperson for Taylor said Vales Point was a major supplier of electricity and the grant would make it “more reliable, more efficient and deliver much needed dispatchable power in NSW”. They said additional reliable capacity would be important after the Liddell power station shut in 2023.', 'This second point – that more coal power is needed to ensure supply and keep prices down after Liddell shuts – is contested. Among other examples, an analysis by consultants RepuTex, commissioned by Greenpeace, found the cheapest way to replace Liddell would be NSW’s now-legislated plan to build 12 gigawatts of renewable energy and 2GW of long-duration storage.', 'Guardian Australia also asked the Berejiklian government a series of questions about its sale of Vales Point and the conditions put in place at the time. It declined to say whether it still believed selling Vales Point for $1m was the right decision.', 'On the $8.7m grant, a NSW government spokesperson said only that it welcomed “any investment by the federal government in our state”.', 'As well as lobbying for support, St Baker has been publicly critical of policies he believes are against his interests. He joined other established electricity leaders in raising concern about the NSW renewables plan and the pressure it would place on his business.', 'He was quoted in the Daily Telegraph as saying he might sue the government over its impact on his coal plant, though it was not clear on what grounds. He later told the Sydney Morning Herald that he had been misquoted, did not plan legal action, and was speaking to the state government about his concerns.', 'St Baker has close ties with the Coalition parties going back decades. As journalist Bob Burton reported in Renew Economy, he was a candidate for the National party in the Brisbane seat of Dickson at the 1993 federal election, but later expressed relief that he was not successful.', 'His private energy company, ERM Power, donated at least $197,640 to political parties over the decade to 2018 before it was sold to Shell last year – most of it to the Liberal National party in Queensland, but about $80,000 to the Labor party in Queensland and NSW.', 'ERM Power worked closely with Campbell Newman’s Queensland LNP government, with the premier opening the company’s Brisbane office and hosting an LNP fundraiser in its boardroom. The St Baker family trust was the equal second largest donor to the LNP in the 2017 state election year, chipping in $50,000.', 'St Baker said he and his wife had decided to back the LNP in the campaign not out of personal or business interest, but because the party could not match the support Labor received from unions and other businesses were reluctant to donate out of fear they would be accused of lobbying.', 'He told the Gladstone Observer: “In all my business life, I have never lobbied for a benefit, and have built businesses on fundamental policy principles which don’t involve government handouts.”', 'St Baker did not respond to requests for an interview with Guardian Australia before publication.', '']",['Adam Morton'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/149da964aca96e4ba31b206358909ae91484d15d/0_18_2000_1201/master/2000.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'Trevor St Baker'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9149417e660845c90b986bc02e2468f7a6d1d11/0_2_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'The Vales Point power station']]",

The manufacture of BEV batteries requires expensive and rare metals, while the secure disposal of used and broken batteries is a problem.

Yet, if the political will is there, the 1996 session of the Conference on Disarmament, now getting down to brass tacks in Geneva, should still be the forum for finally achieving a comprehensive test ban treaty. The signs are certainly more promising than ever before: France and the US, followed by Britain, have declared themselves ready to accept what the scientists call “zero-yield” testing, foregoing the Nevada desert and Pacific atolls for the computer simulation techniques they need to maintain their arsenals.

The timing of one of its two tests last year – just days after pledging “utmost restraint” during negotiations on the indefinite extension of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty – was deliberate nose-thumbing.', 'Outside the club some countries are bridling at the anxiety of the nuclear powers to pursue the test ban without making concessions on disarmament. India has linked progress on a global treaty to negotiations this year on eliminating all nuclear weapons within a specified time. Yet as a “threshold state” (along with Pakistan and Israel) that wishes to maintain its capability to manufacture weapons, its position may be more about bargains than principles.', 'The US and Britain insist there should be no linkage between the treaty and future moves on nuclear disarmament. “Holding one important goal hostage for another is a sure way to fail at both,” conference delegates were told last week by John Holum, director of the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. Incremental progress in such a high-risk area is a sensible way to proceed. But since no one pretends that a test ban treaty will in itself eliminate nuclear weapons, some signal should be given of readiness to move further. Australia is trying to bridge gaps in Geneva while its own Canberra commission of international nuclear experts is sending out the simple but compelling message: disarmament cannot wait for ever.', 'By Martin Walker in Washington\n  18 June 1996', 'France has formally joined Britain in the inner circle of the United States-led nuclear club, signing an agreement to share test and other research data. The deal is intended to ensure the survival of the three countries’ warheads long after a comprehensive test-ban treaty (CTB) comes into force.', 'For France, it represents another crucial step away from the Gaullist tradition of an independent nuclear deterrent, towards the British pattern of retaining nuclear status through almost complete dependence upon the US.', 'The agreement – like President Jacques Chirac’s decision to rejoin Nato’s inner councils and military consultancy committees – is of symbolic importance for France, which for 30 years tried to steer an independent nuclear and strategic course.

India is also heavily dependent on coal, and despite increasing its renewable energy generation has shown little sign of reducing its use of the fossil fuel.', 'China’s greenhouse gas emissions last year climbed higher than their 2019 levels, preliminary data shows, in a blow to hopes that the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic would set the world on a greener path.', 'Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA) and one of the world’s foremost energy economists, said: “Our data indicates a strong rebound in China’s emissions in the second half of 2020. From April onward, monthly emissions in China surpassed the levels of 2019. If this strong trend is confirmed through December, Chinese emissions for the whole of 2020 may well catch up with the 2019 level, despite the sharp decline in the first quarter of 2020.”', 'China approved more new coal-fired power generation in the first half of last year than in the whole of the previous two years, according to Global Energy Monitor and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. China is the world’s biggest emitter, and if its efforts to recover from the economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic are focused on propping up its existing economy, rather than fostering green growth, global emissions will be strongly affected.', '“This is not good news at all,” Birol told the Guardian. “Many countries believe [coal] is still a cheap and domestic source of energy generation, and more importantly, in many countries coal is still the largest employment source.”', 'He pointed to India, where coal is a huge employer. There are more than half a million miners in the country, and more employed indirectly, in energy generation and on the railways, for which coal is the biggest source of freight.', 'China, India and others must grapple urgently with their coal use, said Birol. “The challenge will be how we can find ways to an early retirement of coal plants – this is absolutely critical,” he said.', 'If the same pattern of continuing investment in coal and other fossil fuels is followed in other key emerging economies, such as in Indonesia, where coal use is also heavy, then the chances of a global green recovery will be much reduced, according to Birol.', 'The swift acceleration of carbon dioxide output after the coronavirus lockdowns was a warning that the global recovery from the pandemic would cement higher greenhouse gas emissions for the future if urgent action was not taken, he said. Governments should choose to push for green energy in seeking growth to lift their economies out of recession, he added, because “wind and solar are the cheapest sources of energy generation”.', 'Birol warned last summer that the world had six months to change direction and refocus on a green recovery from the pandemic. But although much of what has happened since was of concern, he said there had been positive signs.

Stopping that surge from undermining the climate fight was up to politicians, he added. “Governments have to find financial instruments to support the good and make life difficult for the bad.”', 'Many countries are now grappling with a second wave of Covid-19 infections, and while vaccines are being rolled out, new variants are also threatening across the world.

The new president will host a global climate summit on 22 April, at which the US plans for emissions cuts within the next decade – known as a nationally determined contribution or NDC under the Paris agreement – are likely to be a focus, along with the his ambition to focus US stimulus spending on kickstarting a low-carbon economy.', 'Birol said: “I expect in 2021 the US, Japan and South Korea, as well as some emerging countries such as India, will put clean energy technologies at the heart of their economic recovery.

Now, as environmentally friendly investing grows at an exponential rate, Fancy has come to a stark conclusion: “This is definitely not going to work.”', 'As the former chief investment officer for sustainable investing at BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, Fancy was charged with embedding environmental, social and governance (ESG) corporate policies across the investment giant’s portfolio.', 'Fancy was a leader in a movement that has given many people, including investors, activists and academics, hope that after years of backing polluters, Wall Street was finally stepping up to confront the climate crisis.', '“I have looked inside the machine and I can tell you business does not have this,” Tariq told the Guardian. “Not because these are bad people but because they run for-profit machines that will operate exactly as you would expect them to do,” said Fancy.', 'Fancy, 42, worked for BlackRock between 2018 and 2019 and was the investor’s chief investment officer for sustainable investing at a time when BlackRock was preparing to announce a major shift in strategy.', '“The evidence on climate risk is compelling investors to reassess core assumptions about modern finance,” the BlackRock chairman, Larry Fink, wrote in his highly influential annual letter to CEOs in 2020, shortly after Fancy’s departure. “In the near future – and sooner than most anticipate – there will be a significant reallocation of capital.”', 'In future, Fink said, BlackRock would transition away from investments in companies that “present a high sustainability-related risk”.', 'BlackRock manages about $7tn in assets and, with one of Wall Street’s biggest voices sounding the alarm about the need to deal with the climate crisis, the news was viewed as a pivotal moment for the financial community.', 'But for Fancy, who now runs the digital learning non-profit Rumie in Toronto, Canada, BlackRock’s move, and the ones it has inspired, contain a fundamental flaw: the climate crisis can never be solved by today’s free markets.', '“It’s not because they are evil, it’s because the system is built to extract profits,” he said.', 'Investors have a fiduciary duty to maximise returns to their clients and as long as there is money to be made in activities that contribute to global warming, no amount of rhetoric about the need for sustainable investing will change that, he believes.', '“In many cases it’s cheaper and easier to market yourself as green rather than do the long tail work of actually improving your sustainability profile. That’s expensive and if there is no penalty from the government, in the form of a carbon tax or anything else, then this market failure is going to persist,” said Fancy, a former investment banker who now leads an initiative to bring affordable digital education to underserved communities worldwide.', 'The amount of money that poured into sustainable investment through vehicles like exchange traded funds (ETFs) hit record levels last year. It’s a trend Fancy believes could continue for years and still have zero impact on climate change because “there is no connection between the two things”.', 'Moving money to green investments doesn’t mean polluters will no longer find backers. The argument is similar to that of divestment, another strategy Fancy says doesn’t work. “If you sell your stock in a company that has a high emissions footprint, it doesn’t matter. The company still exists, the only difference is that you don’t own them. The company is going to keep on going the way they were and there are 20 hedge funds who will buy that stock overnight. The market is the market.', '“I don’t think the public realizes we are not talking about stopping climate change,” he said. “We are literally talking about selling assets so we don’t get caught up in the damage when it hits.”', 'Business knows this, Fancy said, and it also knows the solution – it just doesn’t like it. He compared the business communities reaction to the coronavirus pandemic to its views on climate change. “Science shows us that Covid-19 is a systemic problem for which we all need to bend down a curve, the infections curve.”', 'As the crisis escalated business leaders were immediately supportive of government-led initiatives to restrict travel, close venues and shutter the economy. “The Business Roundtable [the US’s most powerful business lobby] said we should make mask-wearing mandatory. They were right about all those things,” he said.', 'The world needed government to use its extraordinary powers “because if you left it to the free market everything would have been open in the US and we would have lost millions of people, it wouldn’t have been half a million”.', 'Climate change too is a problem science says is systemic and one where we have to bend down the curve. “The difference is the incubation period. It’s not a few weeks, it’s a few decades. For that they are still saying we should rely on the free market. That’s where I have a problem.”', 'A survey of 250 senior executives supports Fancy’s point. About 64% of the executives surveyed in a recent poll commissioned by British lender Standard Chartered said they “believe the economics of operating as a net-zero [carbon emissions] organization do not stack up for their company”. And 79% of senior executives said short-term CEO tenure made it harder for companies to transition to net zero.', 'Under the current system the costs, says Fancy, are simply too high and the benefits of conducting business as usual are too great. A 2019 Morgan Stanley study found that getting to net zero by 2050 will cost $50tn.', '“The reality is that their incentives are very short-term,” he said. “My concern is that when it comes to climate change, it’s actually expensive. It’s like saying when it comes for Covid-19 that’s a crisis and an opportunity. Well yeah, it’s an opportunity for Zoom, it’s not an opportunity for society.”', 'There is a solution, said Fancy, and it’s the one that business leaders embraced in the coronavirus crisis: government intervention. But – given the long time line for climate change – it’s one that business leaders don’t like.', 'What would work is a change in government policy that made it more expensive to pollute, such as a carbon tax, because that would change the corporate world and Wall Street’s incentives.', '“If you put a tax on carbon, every single portfolio manager would adjust their portfolio,” he said.', 'BlackRock disputes Fancy’s analysis. In a statement the company said: “Sustainable investing can deliver strong investment returns while also helping to address urgent social and environmental concerns.”', 'The company added that it believes greenwashing “is a risk to investors and detrimental to the asset management industry’s credibility, which is why we strongly support regulatory initiatives to set consistent standards and increase transparency for sustainable portfolios”.', 'But for Fancy the overarching point is that real change has to be led by government, not Wall Street.', '“If I was on a panel and someone asked me what’s the best way to tackle climate change?

Following a landmark legal case in the US made famous by the Mark Ruffalo film Dark Waters, a huge epidemiological study was carried out that linked PFAS to high cholesterol, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, testicular cancer, kidney cancer and pregnancy-induced hypertension.', 'Separate studies have made connections between PFAS and miscarriage, reduced birth weight, endocrine disruption, reduced sperm quality, delayed puberty, early menopause and reduced immune response to tetanus vaccination. Scientists have also found that the substances can be passed from mother to baby via the placenta and breast milk.', 'On top of multiple class actions in the US, cases are being brought around the world. In Australia, two towns adjacent to airbases using PFAS in firefighting foam have been warned not to drink their tap water, and in Italy industry is thought to have exposed 350,000 people to the toxic contaminant. It is estimated that almost everyone in the world now has PFAS in their blood.', 'In England, the Environment Agency says PFAS is “ubiquitous in the environment”, particularly in its waters, making it unlikely that drinking water sources have escaped contamination. But unlike countries such as the US, where a nationwide testing scheme is under way, the UK government has so far only made plans to make plans to understand the levels of drinking water pollution.', 'The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) says it takes “the risks posed by PFAS chemicals very seriously, which is why we’re working at pace with regulators to better assess their presence in our natural environment and their sources.” It says it is “developing its approach to managing risk from PFAS” but it is not testing drinking water.', 'Water companies do not routinely test for PFAS either. Instead, they are expected to “consider” just two restricted PFAS – PFOS and PFOA – in their risk assessments. According to Defra, there “have been no notifications of an event associated with elevated levels of PFOS or PFOA since 2005”. In Scotland, only PFOA is risk-assessed.', 'Dr Ian Ross, the global PFAS practice lead at the consultancy Tetra Tech, says the huge number of potential PFAS sources – from airfields and industry to landfills and car washes – make risk assessment very difficult.', '“Water companies may need to perform a detailed assessment of many catchments considering a multitude of PFAS sources before determining that water from each catchment is unlikely to supply PFAS-impacted water,” Ross said. “This is more concerning now a new, lower, 10 nanogram/litre limit from the drinking water inspectorate has been introduced, which triggers consultation with health professionals.”', 'The industry group WaterUK said: “Companies in risk areas have monitoring in place to support the removal of PFAS, and other potentially harmful substances, to ensure drinking water is clean and safe.”', 'Even so, the drinking water inspectorate has only set the 10ng/l limit for PFOS and PFOA, and there are no limits on the wider group of chemicals. In contrast, Denmark has a limit of 100ng/l for the total of 12 PFAS, with lower levels proposed for PFOS of 3ng/l; Sweden has set a 90ng/l for the sum of 11 PFAS; and Bavaria has regulated 13 individual PFAS to a range of limits between 0.1 micrograms (µg)/l and 10µg/l.', 'The EU recently revised its drinking water directive, reducing the acceptable level to 100ng/l for 20 types of PFAS and 500 ng/l for all PFAS substances. The directive entered into force in January and member states have two years to adopt it.', 'It is not clear whether the UK will follow suit.

We urgently need a full assessment of PFAS contamination in drinking water in the UK. Continuous exposure to PFAS may lead to long-term adverse health effects, and drinking water is recognised as one of the main sources of our exposure to PFAS.”', 'An outright ban on all non-essential uses of PFAS is under discussion among EU countries, but there are no signs that the UK intends to take the same tack. “Every year of delay in regulating these chemicals means an increasing level of exposure due to their extreme persistence and capacity to accumulate in the water and the wider environment,” said Schneider.', 'Responding to the use restrictions put in place on PFOS and PFOA, the industry has created replacement chemicals known as GenX, but researchers suggest these could be just as harmful to humans and the environment, and could be even harder to detect.']",['Rachel Salvidge'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e59fb999a632fa9e9ed3b9a04b52215afb233872/0_38_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'Tap water']]",

Paraquat warning labels carry the symbol of death – a skull and crossbones.', 'Paraquat exposure is also believed by some scientists to cause Parkinson’s disease, and Syngenta is facing litigation on that issue – though it denies responsibility.', 'Still, many countries allow wide use of paraquat, and the toll from paraquat poisonings is estimated at well into the thousands. The low cost and high toxicity makes paraquat a popular poison for people trying to kill themselves. Syngenta says it is just one of 377 companies worldwide that have registered paraquat for sale.', 'But now, internal corporate documents, obtained by a US law firm and provided to the Guardian, detail how the need for a safer formulation of Syngenta’s popular Gramoxone paraquat-based product has been the subject of in-depth company discussions for decades. Years of analysis and debate over the issue are laid out in the records, as are arguments about the accuracy of data presented to regulators, and strategies to avoid regulatory bans.', 'The documents, which date back to 1968, show that Syngenta and its predecessor corporate entities rejected or resisted many different options for changes to the formulations of Gramoxone, due, at least in part, to a desire to protect profits. Financial concerns were cited repeatedly in the discussions about formulation changes as company officials pushed to keep Gramoxone on the market despite mounting concerns about fatalities.', 'The documents also show that a longtime Syngenta scientist, who left the company in April 2008 after 28 years, argued with company officials multiple times over his belief that lives could have been saved with tweaks to product formulations that he said Syngenta considered too costly to make.', 'That scientist, Jon Heylings, formerly the head of research and investigative toxicology at Syngenta, accuses his former employer and Syngenta’s predecessor companies of relying on data generated in the 1970s that, according to Heylings, misrepresented the amount of an additive that could potentially make Gramoxone less deadly.', 'Heylings told the company more of the additive was needed than was stated. But his concerns were rejected and a product he developed that he believed was safer was shelved. After first raising the issue within the company in 1990, Heylings – who now works as a contractor for Public Health England on paraquat matters – recently renewed his push for Syngenta to acknowledge his concerns.', '“I am sure we all agree that falsified data should not be used on matters of human safety with Syngenta’s products,” Heylings wrote in a June 2019 email to Syngenta’s global regulatory manager.', 'The documents show Syngenta’s product safety team determined internally that Heylings’ allegations were not substantiated and sent him a lengthy rebuttal to his assertions.', '“While we respect your opinion, we believe we have thoroughly investigated and addressed your concerns,” the global regulatory manager responded to Heylings.', 'Syngenta told the Guardian that Heylings’ allegations were meritless, and said the company was “absolutely committed” to ensuring its products are used safely. “Heylings is now turning to the media because his views have not been accepted by Syngenta or the regulatory bodies he approached and are not supported by modern medical science as well,” the firm said.', 'Heylings is now working with the environmental organization Greenpeace to publicize his accusations and alert regulators. He sent his allegations to the EPA and to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO).', 'At the heart of the matter is a chemical compound that induces vomiting when ingested. After introducing Gramoxone in 1962, a Syngenta predecessor called Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) began exploring the idea of adding an emetic, as the compound is called, to its paraquat product to trigger rapid vomiting in people who ingested it. If the vomiting happened fast enough, the theory went, it possibly could rid people’s bodies of the poison before it could kill them.', 'The idea was not initially embraced, as seen in comments from 1970 correspondence that “a very large quantity of emetic” would be needed in the formulation, which would make it “undesirable from commercial and other points of view …” and even if added it was unlikely to “succeed in preventing fatalities”.', 'Faced with evidence of accidental poisonings and also intentional ingestion by people trying to kill themselves, the company continued to explore the idea, however, investigating what quantities of emetic would be required to induce vomiting fast enough to prevent death.', 'In a 1972 company document marked “highly confidential”, objectives were laid out for a paraquat “reduction of hazards” project. The document states the team agreed to “investigate all possible means of reducing accident hazards by formulation”, but also stated: “The team recognized that there were alternative approaches to the problem of saving lives and maintaining ‘Gramoxone’ on the market and that the introduction of safer formulations might not be the means adopted.”', 'By 1973, the issue was becoming urgent, according to the minutes of a meeting discussing what progress had been made on development of a safer formulation. The head of the UK Poisons Centre told company officials that it was becoming increasingly difficult for him to “champion” Gramoxone as he had done for years due to the evidence of related poisonings and deaths, and called for “something to be done in a hurry”.', 'Still, the company resisted adding an emetic, with one official stating that the drawback to adding an emetic to Gramoxone was “mainly one of cost and compatibility,” according to a 1974 company document.', 'The records show that in addition to the idea of adding an emetic, the company explored many additions to its formulations to deter people, particularly children, from ingesting paraquat, including the addition of a coloring agent to differentiate the pesticide from the appearance of tea or a soft drink, a stench to make the product smell bad, solid formulations and stronger warning language on labels.', 'The company’s pursuit of a safer formulation became even more urgent in the mid-1970s as regulators increasingly took note of the deadly nature of the chemical and a US distribution partner feared the United States would force the product from the market there.', 'After studying the emetic on monkeys, dogs and other animals, as well as a small human trial, the company eventually settled on a dose of 5mg per 10ml of Gramoxone, and research supporting that dose was submitted to regulators.', 'The emetic was added to paraquat formulations in various countries starting in 1977, including in Western Samoa (now Samoa), where company officials reported a “regrettably high incidence of suicides with paraquat”.', 'But after more than a decade of the addition of the emetic and other changes aimed at deterring ingestion, the company was still facing problems with high numbers of paraquat poisonings, according to an October 1990 internal memo. Measures that might lower deaths, such as diluting liquid formulations at least five times, would “destroy Group profit from paraquat”, the memo states.', 'It was in 1990 that Heylings began championing a higher level of emetic. He told company officials the data underlying the dose decision from the 1970s was deeply flawed and that the research actually reflected that it would take three times the amount of emetic to render the weedkilling products less deadly.', 'Yet, according to company correspondence in 1997, newer research showed that too high of a level of emetic could cause vomiting that was so violent that it could damage the gastrointestinal tract and push vomit into the lungs.', 'Syngenta said that the EPA and FAO have disagreed with Heylings’ conclusions and that adding more emetic could actually create more harm.', '“We reject any suggestion that in developing this product Syngenta and its predecessors had any motive other than to find the most appropriate level of emetic in paraquat to best address the risk from accidental and deliberate ingestion,” the company said in a statement. “Syngenta has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in developing and commercializing safer paraquat formulations over many decades.”', 'And despite the risk to users, Syngenta’s paraquat product is an “essential weed-control and resistance-management tool for farmers”, the company said, adding it uses a blue dye and a stenching agent to make it safer.', 'The FAO said it looked into Heylings’ allegations and is finalizing a report on paraquat now, with its conclusions to be published soon. The EPA also confirmed its awareness of Heylings’ allegations, but said the agency does not require any amount of emetic in paraquat products and believes the measures that truly save lives are the warning labels and restrictions on use.', 'Concerns about accidental poisonings are only the tip of an iceberg of issues that have emerged about the dangers of paraquat and Syngenta’s efforts to deal with those dangers.', 'The lawyer who obtained the internal documents, Missouri-based litigator Steve Tillery, has been quietly amassing evidence that he says shows Syngenta not only skimped on the emetic in its formulations, but knew – and covered up – evidence that the product also causes Parkinson’s disease in long-term users such as farmers.', 'Syngenta denies any such evidence of a connection between their product and Parkinson’s, which is an incurable progressive nervous system disorder that limits a person’s ability to control movement, causing tremors, loss of balance and eventually often leaving victims bedridden or forced to use a wheelchair. It also denies any attempt at a cover-up.', 'Several scientific studies have linked paraquat to Parkinson’s, including a large study of US farmers jointly overseen by multiple government agencies. But the EPA recently completed what it called a “thorough review” of the scientific information on paraquat and Parkinson’s disease and concluded that the weight of evidence was “insufficient” to link paraquat to Parkinson’s disease.', 'The company’s handling of the emetic situation is illustrative of its handling of concerns about Parkinson’s disease, according to Tillery, who said he hopes to be able to introduce evidence of the emetic issue in the Parkinson’s litigation.', 'The first case to go to trial over the allegations against Syngenta over paraquat and Parkinson’s is scheduled for 12 April in Illinois. The trial is very likely to be delayed due to precautions related to the Covid-19 virus, however, according to a court spokesperson.', 'That Illinois case – Hoffman V Syngenta – is one of several pending against Syngenta alleging the company’s paraquat products cause Parkinson’s disease. Syngenta was acquired by China National Chemical Corporation (ChemChina) in 2015, giving an added international twist to the litigation.', 'Lawyers around the US are now seeking people who may have been exposed to paraquat and now suffer from Parkinson’s disease.', 'Heylings has been deposed by the US law firm, and said he would like to help in the US court case against Syngenta.', '“This is important. This is human health,” he said in an interview arranged by Greenpeace. “Maybe the legal system in the US will get to the bottom of this.”', 'In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Climate protection is not nice to have; climate protection is our basic right and that’s official now. This is a huge win for the climate movement, it changes a lot.”', 'The court said it was unconstitutional for emission reduction targets to have been postponed for so many years and stated that the law was not detailed enough about how reductions would happen.', 'The case was brought by young environmental activists, backed by Fridays for Future along with Greenpeace, Germany’s Friends of the Earth (BUND) and other NGOs. Among them was Sophie Backsen, 22, an agricultural science student from the North Frisian island of Pellworm, on Germany’s North Sea coast, together with her younger brothers, Hannes, Paul and Jakob. Her parents, who run an organic farm on the island that Backsen hopes one day to manage, had taken a similar case to Berlin’s administrative court two years ago, together with Greenpeace, but it had ruled against them.', 'The Backsens were joined by two other families from the East Frisian island of Langeoog and another complainant from Brandenburg, all of whom are involved in either farming, sustainable tourism or both. In their complaint, they told the court they had all experienced first-hand the effects of the climate crisis, including flooding and heatwaves. The group also secured the support of Neubauer, Germany’s Fridays for Future’s main representative who is seen as the country’s leading climate activist.', 'The judges ruled that young people’s “fundamental rights to a human future” were threatened and that the law in its current state jeopardised their freedom because the goals set were too focused on dates too far in the future. It said that it was only possible to reduce the rise in average global temperatures to between 1.5C and 2C – as set out in the 2015 Paris agreement – with “more urgent and shorter term measures”.', '“The challenged rules violate the freedoms of the complainants, some of whom are still very young,” the judges said in a statement.

They discuss their journey so far', 'Joe and Mario Duplantier grew up in a calm idyll – perhaps surprisingly for two of metal’s most forthright rabble-rousers. Born to a sketch-artist father and yoga teacher mother, the brothers were raised in Ondres, a remote commune on France’s western coast. Their house was so rural that, when a journalist visited, he compared it to a “hermitage”. Music was always playing, from folk to Mike Oldfield; it only stopped when poets and painters stayed the night and the children overheard the grownups discussing international philosophies.', 'The pair often passed the time on the beach. Joe collected wood and stones – only to come home to find his hands black with crude oil. Mario, meanwhile, had plastic bags flying in his face when he was out surfing. The serenity of the fairytale upbringing cracked. “We were confronted by nature hurting all the time, and nature hurting hurts you,” says Joe, the elder brother.', 'The Duplantiers vocalise that hurt in Gojira, an extreme metal quartet loved not only for their musicianship – rampaging and intricate – but also their environmentalist outcries. “The greatest miracle is burning to the ground,” Joe shouts on Amazonia. A single from the new album, Fortitude, it is a grooving monster that laments the destruction of the rainforest. (All proceeds from the track go to a charity for tribes who have suffered through deforestation.)', 'Joe says that – amid the bleak imagery – Gojira want Fortitude “to express something that would empower people and inspire them”. He dubs it a call for “civil disobedience”, designed to invigorate listeners into action. The anthem Into the Storm could soundtrack a revolution with its countercultural lyricism (“You’re awake now! Put your fist in the air!”) and Mario’s marching drums, while Born for One Thing begs us to look up from our phones to a wounded world. “Who are we to say if humanity is worth continuing?” the vocalist asks. “I think having hope for the future is a default setting that we have. We choose to be in that energy that wants to succeed – if everyone says: ‘We’re not gonna make it,’ we’re not gonna make it!”', 'Despite their youth surrounded by creativity, Joe and Mario were not brought up to be metal’s next sociopolitical visionaries. Hard rock was the only thing their parents never played on the radio. It wasn’t until the brothers’ cousin “forced” Joe to listen to Metallica that it clicked. Mario, then 12, also got hooked: “It was just the vibration, the tone, the drumming – it was mystical.”', 'Joe adds: “I think metal attracts sensitive people. I was born sensitive, bullied in school – I hated humans. The themes are very emotive, and there’s a traumatised aspect that attracted me.”', 'Its rage energised the pair to emulate their heroes, with Joe picking up the guitar and becoming a singer. “For me, it was never a thing to preach or have a message,” he says. “It’s music that comes from the guts. I’m yelling into a microphone. The yelling made the important words come out. I’m not gonna yell about the last pizza I had.” Mario – a fiery and extroverted youngster – fell for the drums. “All my friends at school played rugby, but I didn’t like it; drumming was my rugby. It was my way of expressing myself with my body,” he says.', 'Gojira formed in 1996, when the two put out an ad looking for musicians inspired by the band Death. Through that came the second guitarist, Christian Andreu; later came the bassist, Jean-Michel Labadie. The four called themselves Godzilla – there is nothing more metal than a fire-spewing kaiju – before switching to the Japanese translation.', 'They self-released their debut, Terra Incognita, in 2001. Moulded by the conversations the Duplantiers listened in on as kids, its title alludes to Hindu mythology, specifically the unknown place where Brahma hid godhood from humanity after their abuse of its power. The 2003 follow-up, The Link, was similarly metaphysical, pondering resurrection, meditation and enlightenment through suffering.', '“The music was more spiritual at first,” says Mario. “There were a lot of metaphors and [philosophical] images. When we released From Mars to Sirius in 2005, we stayed poetic, but a song like Global Warming was something truly important to our environmental message.”', 'With its sci-fi narrative about humanity depleting the Earth and searching for another home, From Mars to Sirius was Gojira’s first climate-crisis-oriented outing, as well as their international breakthrough. Its bold take on death metal balanced breakdown-laden juggernauts such as Backbone (which remains one of the heaviest things ever composed) with spaced-out epics, built on tapped guitar playing and serene vocal passages.', '“We were ready to conquer the world!” Joe exclaims. “We had so much energy and we weren’t scared, tired or bored. After 10 years of grinding and working hard, we were on fire – so ready and hungry to meet new audiences.”', 'That piss and vinegar flowed through The Way of All Flesh and L’Enfant Sauvage, both of which refined Gojira’s abrasive sound. The band frequently tour the US and Europe and their live shows are meticulously perfected by watching videos of themselves back every night – “something every musician should do”, Mario says.', 'That unyielding lifestyle shaped the sixth album, Magma, in 2015. “When you’re a musician, touring is 90% of your life,” the drummer says. “For weeks, you screamed every night and your body is struggling to go back to normal. It’s the best job in the world and the most painful. That has a huge impact on the way you write. You won’t be able to play crazy, violent, fast for ever.”', 'The songs were hugely simplified, each built around one or two riffs. Classic verse-chorus-verse-chorus structures became more prevalent and the delicate potential of Joe’s voice was emphasised further, crafting a meditative mood. That tone was consolidated after the Duplantiers’ mother, Patricia Rosa, died that July. “Not all of Magma came from our mum passing, but it affected us, of course, deeply,” says Joe. “It was such a huge deal in our hearts and minds, spiritually. It happened exactly as we were writing songs, so how to avoid that? It’s impossible. It’s all over the album.”', '“Our mum always said: ‘Death is part of life. You have to accept that,’” Mario says. “Talking about death was not a problem. When we were kids, she always thought it could be an interesting discussion. You’re born and you’ll die; that’s the circle of life. So, as a child, I really didn’t understand why everyone would cry and wear black clothes when someone died.”', 'As a result, Magma isn’t a dirge, but an inquisition into what is beyond death. The opening rocker, The Shooting Star, gives Patricia directions to the afterlife through the constellations: “Between the bear and the scorpion, you’re getting close.” The title track mentions reincarnation and climax; Low Lands begs for her knowledge of what is beyond the grave.', 'The insightful post-metal earned Gojira two Grammy nominations and they supported their idols Metallica on the accompanying tour. However, as proud as Gojira are of the album that brought such success, Fortitude is an intentional reversal. It maintains Magma’s alluring simplicity, but swaps to a motivational headspace. “Magma was intimate, an inside thing, whereas Fortitude is an outside thing: a more outgoing, punchy and political thing,” says Joe.', 'It’s also an ode to the Duplantiers’ artistic childhoods, exploring more than just the trauma of the climate crisis. Born for One Thing references Thai and Tibetan philosophy; the uplifting refrain of The Chant is as folk as it is metal; and The Trails is prowling prog-pop – something that could have been played on the radio back home. “We had a great time with our parents listening to the Beatles and Pink Floyd,” says Mario. “I always wanted to add a few elements of that.”', 'Representing metal at its eclectic, morally astute best, Fortitude deserves to turn Gojira into megastars, yet the band eye their future with excitement and cynicism. “I want us to be relevant for a long time, but at the same time I really don’t,” Joe says. “We’re talking about big issues here. They need to be solved.”', 'Fortitude is out now on Roadrunner Records.']",['Matt Mills'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/853ce1aab0ebf9d22d16b57f63c7bbd7135e2387/0_0_4378_2918/master/4378.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'Gojira, l-r: Mario Duplantier, Joe Duplantier, Christian Andreu, Jean-Michel Labadie.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/399626c73c86bcac0dd2cfddd59292e4e9ff675c/0_0_3000_2116/master/3000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Joe Duplantier (right) and Jean-Michel Labadie performing with Gojira in 2019'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4693ad94680cffa12427d4c53580b0405429137d/136_206_5419_3635/master/5419.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Gojira … ‘You won’t be able to play crazy, violent, fast for ever.’']]",

We have to transform our economy. There are huge benefits, but it’s a huge challenge. The biggest threat is the social one. If we don’t fix this, our children will be waging wars over water and food. There is no doubt in my mind.”', 'Tackling climate change will be many times cheaper than the disruption that global heating will cause, as well as bringing benefits to health, and the costs have fallen dramatically in recent years. However, the shift away from fossil fuels will mean the end of some traditional jobs such as coalmining, and the costs of change will fall unequally on different sectors of society unless politicians step in.', '“Where I see a huge risk is that you get an alliance between those who don’t want change because they see their interest affected, whether it’s in fossil fuels or in traditional economic circles,” Timmermans told the Guardian in an interview. “Those interests combine with the fear of negative social consequences. Then you could get a counter-momentum where people say, ‘Hang on, not too fast, people cannot stomach this.’”', 'He added: “Those of us who understand we need to move fast should make the social issue the pivotal issue in all of this. I really call upon all of those in the climate movement to join me in focusing on the social issue more than they’ve done in the past. Because this could become the biggest stumbling block.”', 'He warned that sacrifices would be needed from the older generation to ensure that young people can live in a safe climate. Today’s older people were the beneficiaries of a previous generation’s sacrifice, and were now being called on to make changes themselves, he said.', '“Sometimes I wonder whether we are aware of the transformation we’re heading to, and how profound it is. It’s an effort comparable to restructuring after a violent conflict. I used to talk to my grandparents and my parents about how they saw this, after the war. They said, ‘Well, we sacrificed a lot because we knew our children would be better off.’ And this feeling is not there yet in our society.”', 'Changing people’s lives today would be difficult, but the benefits would be felt by today’s children, he added. “This for politics is a huge, huge challenge. We need to recapture that feeling of a purpose – doing something not for yourself, but for others, which I think has always led to society being at its best.”', 'Any sacrifice would be mild for most, such as the inconvenience of having a house renovated to low-carbon standards, or switching to electric transport, and eating less meat. But for some it could involve a change of job or living patterns.', '“We’re not asking people to go back to 1930s situations, we’re not asking people to live in caves and munch grass. It’s taking perhaps one or two steps back to be able to jump much further in to the future.”', 'Timmermans’ warnings reflect a growing concern among climate experts that politicians have failed to show people the benefits of a low-carbon society, which include cleaner air and water, more livable cities, and higher levels of health and wellbeing, as well as defusing the climate crisis. Politicians, including Donald Trump and Republicans in the US, have presented tackling climate breakdown as a cost, and many people are fearful for their jobs.', 'Timmermans acknowledged that some people in traditional industries would have to change, and said the main role for politicians was to make this easier. Reskilling people in industries such as fossil fuel and power generation would be key.', 'He pointed to Poland, which is highly dependent on coal. “They have a very high level of engineering, of education – there’s a huge potential there [in a low-carbon economy] for a country like Poland. And there simply isn’t any future in coal. The longer you protract [the change], the more painful and the more costly it will be.”', 'Timmermans has a pivotal role this year, within the EU and globally, as he leads the bloc’s green deal, intended to transform the European economy to a low-carbon footing, and leads the bloc’s climate efforts at Cop26, vital UN climate talks to be hosted by the UK in Glasgow this November.', 'On Thursday, he travelled to London for his first official visit outside Brussels since the pandemic lockdowns began, with a four-hour meeting in Downing Street with Alok Sharma, the UK’s Cop26 president and host of the talks.

This is one of the most stretching climate targets yet put forward, alongside those of the UK and the US, though campaigners have said the bloc could do better and have called for a 60% target.', 'Timmermans said no further improvement of the emissions target was possible, but said he was asking EU member states to come forward with more money for climate finance: assistance from rich to poor countries to help them cut emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown.', '“Our approach is ambitious; I think we’ve set the stage. I hope others will follow that example. I see what the UK is doing – that’s even slightly more ambitious than what we’re doing. But then all the others still have a lot of catching up to do.

Eco art activists Cooking Sections are highlighting their plight – and getting Tate to change its menus', 'A few months back, a book arrived in the post – tiny, not much larger than a bank card. Though the cover was grey, its pages were a riot of pinks, from deepest persimmon to pale rose. Printed on them were dense, technical essays referencing everything from fish farming to Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations. The title was Salmon: A Red Herring.', 'Fish is an unexpected topic for an art book – but then the duo who created this little volume, Daniel Fernández Pascual and Alon Schwabe, aren’t really going for the coffee-table market. Operating under the name Cooking Sections, the pair have a thing for food. Their art is about what we eat and its impact on the Earth.', 'In previous projects, they have explored irrigation issues in Sicily, soil rights in Ukraine and migrations of Alpine cattle, in addition to creating installations in such places as the Peggy Guggenheim in Venice and Berlin’s Neue Nationalgalerie. At an architecture exhibition in the UAE in 2019, they planted a “desert garden” in the grounds of a school in Sharjah – an exploration of how farmers in the driest parts of the world could use drought-resistant plants to create more sustainable agriculture.', 'Cooking Sections’ enthusiasm for salmon came about after an invitation from Tate Britain in London to create an exhibition – one that was open for just a matter of days in late November before being shut by lockdown. (Pascual and Schwabe hope that when the museum eventually reopens, their show will too.)', 'A modest one-room installation, it resembled a sort of natural history diorama, plunging you into the realities of Scottish fish farming. Over 15 minutes, a bare white stage populated with static sculptures of various animals (seal, penguin, lobster, flamingo) was illuminated pink, then blood-red, while a voice solemnly explained how salmon are industrially farmed.', 'The facts were grim: crammed into pens for up to two years and fed processed food, many end up deformed, blind, riddled with sea lice, and are often driven to eat each other. Then there’s the pollution. According to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, insecticides from the country’s 76 fish farms are leaching out in quantities that harm other marine life. Despite all this, Brits are guzzling farmed salmon at record rates: it’s now the most popular seafood in supermarkets, worth an estimated £1bn annually to the UK economy. “Not pleasant,” says Pascual mildly.', 'If all this weren’t enough to make you think again about what you’re cooking for dinner, Schwabe and Pascual discovered that industrial fish farmers use a special colour swatch called the SalmoFan to customise their product. Unable to feed on their natural diet of krill or baby lobster, farmed salmon flesh is naturally grey – but no one wants grey fish, so the animals are fed dye pellets, as if they were being ordered up from Dulux. Different global markets even prefer different pinks: redder, more tuna-y tones for Japan and east Asia, lighter ones for Europe.', 'But why put all this in an art gallery. Isn’t it education? Environmental activism? Pascual shrugs. “The gallery is an amplifier of ideas. We see a lot of potential in cultural spaces trailblazing, paving the way for others.”', 'The pair started working together in 2012, when both were students at Goldsmiths in London. Pascual trained as an architect in Spain and Berlin, while Schwabe, who grew up in Tel Aviv, has a theatre and performance background. Three years later, they began work on a project they call Climavore, which illuminates issues around agriculture and climate change. Salmon: A Red Herring is just one part of something they hope will go on for years.', '“Food is a tool,” explains Schwabe. “It enables you to understand environments and landscapes and geopolitics.” Pascual adds: “It touches on many different levels. Food is one of the biggest contributors to the dispersal of emissions into the atmosphere. It’s also one of the driving forces behind deforestation. It’s everywhere.”', 'The installation that made their name was the “oyster table” they built in 2017 in an inlet near Portree on the Isle of Skye. A humble-looking, metal cage-like structure perched on the shoreline, when the tide is high it acts as a habitat for bivalves and seaweed; when the seawater recedes, it can be used as a table for communal meals. It aims to highlight how, as traditional fishing has faded, Skye’s economy has become dependent on the industrial fish farms that now blanket the island’s waters.', 'Reporting on its unveiling, Frieze magazine observed that, unusually for an art opening, the dress code featured wellies and fisherman’s bibs. Despite the seriousness of their work – in person, Pascual and Schwabe are as earnest as you might expect – a vein of playfulness and celebration runs through it too. They’re currently fundraising to extend the project, and have grand ambitions for how it could help change the economy and ecology of the island.', 'They’ve used food to lay bare other uncomfortable truths, too. One of my favourite Cooking Sections projects – arguably even more timely, given debates about the UK’s colonial history, than when it was originally created in 2016 – is one they called the Empire Remains Shop. It was inspired by their discovery of a 1920s advertising campaign by Britain’s Empire Marketing Board (slogan: “Buy Empire”). This urged British consumers to spend their hard-earned shillings on goods sourced from overseas territories under British colonial control.', 'One of the original wheezes was a recipe for a so-called “Empire Christmas pudding” using 17 ingredients that included cloves from Zanzibar, Palestinian oranges and rum from British Guiana – revealing how this most traditionally British of desserts relied, in fact, on colonisation.', 'Pascual and Schwabe created a pop-up shop in central London, which hosted discussions, dinners and screenings, and in 2018 published a book exploring the issues it raised through food.', 'As Schwabe explains, they also work with agronomists, food producers, restaurants, politicians and more, trying to find more ecologically sound solutions to the problems they pose. “Without all of these working together,” he says, “from our perspective it’s impossible to envisage change.”', 'The fact that Tate was founded by a sugar baron – profits from a foodstuff built on slavery literally funding art – adds a certain pointedness to their installation at Tate Britain. Whereas artists have struggled for decades with how to represent the climate crisis, anxious about seeming preachy or unsure what their role should be, Cooking Sections make no bones that want to make a real difference, even if much of the work is unglamorous and largely behind-the-scenes.', 'They’re not alone: fellow Goldsmiths alumni Forensic Architecture have melded design and activism, undertaking investigations into state violence or human-rights violations.“Socially engaged” collectives such as the Edinburgh-based Arika group run projects linking art with social change.', 'And the broader art world seems finally to have woken up to its own role in the climate emergency. Art is, after all, a globalised industry, both directly and indirectly responsible for pumping out vast quantities of CO2.

Tate was one of the first major art institutions to acknowledge the climate emergency, in summer 2019. And it is currently working on a carbon-cutting plan. But I’m sure I’ve nibbled at least one smoked salmon sandwich in a Tate cafe. No longer, Schwabe says triumphantly: anyone visiting the four museums when they reopen will notice that farmed salmon has been banished entirely from its cafes and restaurants. They’ve been working with the catering team to come up with alternatives promoting “regenerative aquaculture”.', 'Though the show is currently closed, when we catch up over Zoom a few weeks later, it turns out that they’ve hardly been idle. As well as continuing to teach at the Royal College of Art, they are among 60 artists to participate in a new multi-year project with London’s Serpentine Gallery called Back to Earth, which launches in the spring – another indication of how seriously the art world is taking the climate emergency.', 'They’re still figuring out what form it’ll take, but it’ll build on the Tate show, spreading the word about sustainable agriculture, food waste, related issues.

Given that nature-based solutions can make a significant contribution to the climate mitigation needed to stabilise global heating, a functioning finance channel will be important for climate change progress, and particularly for developing countries.', 'But a joint investigation into the offsetting schemes used by some of the world’s largest airlines carried out by the Guardian and Unearthed, Greenpeace’s investigative arm, found that although many forest projects were doing valuable conservation work, the credits that they generated by preventing environmental destruction appear to be based on a flawed and much-criticised system, even though these credits were being used to back up claims of “carbon-neutral flying” and net-zero commitments.', 'We looked at 10 forest protection schemes that airlines were using before the pandemic which had been accredited by Verra, a US nonprofit which administers the world’s leading carbon credit standard, VCS (Verified Carbon Standard). Projects estimate the emissions they have prevented by predicting how much deforestation and land clearing would have occurred without them. The reductions are then sold on as credits. We found their predictions were often inconsistent with previous levels of deforestation in the area and in some cases, the threat to the trees may have been overstated.', 'Beyond that, there are concerns about the inherent problem of looking into the future and predicting which trees would and would not have been felled, and of proving additionality – that the project itself made a difference to the outcome – which have dogged the offset system from its outset. Although there has been work to address this fundamental issue, we found that concerns remained.', 'The findings have been fiercely criticised by Verra, who maintain the methods they endorse have contributed to the fight against climate change and deforestation, and transformed local economies for the better.', 'Thales West, a scientist and former project auditor, led a study on schemes in the Brazilian Amazon that found that projects had routinely overstated their emissions reductions. He said that the methodologies “are not robust enough” which means “there is room for projects to generate credits that have no impact on the climate whatsoever”.', 'Arild Angelsen, a professor of economics at Norwegian University of Life Sciences and a specialist in Redd+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation), said that although Verra methodologies for claiming credits were a serious attempt to measure emission reductions from reducing deforestation, they were not currently robust enough.', 'Britaldo Soares-Filho, a deforestation modelling expert and professor at the institute of geosciences at the Federal University of Minas Gerais told the Guardian that under the current system, calculating genuine emission reductions relied on being able to accurately predict the future. “Models are not crystal balls. Models are a sign to help devise policy and evaluate policy choices.”', 'Land use software that he designed, Dinamica EGO, is frequently used by projects to predict where deforestation would have taken place.

So a reference region can be set up to be most convenient to a project to maximise its baseline deforestation rate.”', 'Verra, which certifies the projects studied by this investigation, pointed out that many of the benefits provided by these projects were difficult to measure. “Verra channels finance, technology, and knowhow to forest-dependent rural communities who otherwise lack resources. These projects tackle deforestation in increasingly novel and creative ways.”', 'They create jobs by creating wardens to look out for illegal logging; they support local farmers wanting to move to more sustainable practices; they improve access to water and education. “In a nutshell, projects are working to transform local economies so that they no longer have to depend on cutting down the forest.” Some of the projects pointed out that they were dealing with aggressive cattle ranchers and loggers, corrupt government officials, coca plantations and local drug cartels, and extreme poverty, as well as climate change.', 'But Verra also believes strongly in its Redd+ programme, and argued that the analysis by our investigation was “profoundly flawed”. It pointed out that since our initial contact with it, it had begun the process of amending its standard with a comprehensive set of updates that it believes represents “our commitment to making sure the accounting for emission reductions from forest preservation efforts is as accurate as possible, consistently incorporates the latest scientific best practice, and supports government-led efforts to stop deforestation”.', 'Crystal Davis, the director of Global Forest Watch at the World Resources Institute, strongly defended the usefulness of conservation finance mechanisms and pointed out that “tropical forests cannot afford to lose Redd+ as a mechanism for conservation financing at scale”.', 'She did not think the analysis by McKenzie Intelligence Services (MIS), a London-based company that specialises in geospatial imagery analysis and intelligence, showed projects were inflating their projections, but agreed “that post-facto assessment of the integrity of baselines is really hard to do.', '“That’s a big problem. I don’t think Redd+ will ever realise its full potential as a conservation financing mechanism if we can’t create more public-facing transparency and accountability in the system.” She added that she was encouraged to see major efforts under way to achieve this.', 'It’s well over a decade since the world’s governments came up with a plan to slow and even stop deforestation as part of international action on the climate crisis. The plan was simple: developing countries would, basically, be paid not to cut down trees. The idea, signed off in 2007, was called Redd+.', 'It was hoped that the emissions reductions would feed into a cap-and-trade system for the climate, a market-based method that had proved successful a couple of decades earlier at dealing with acid rain (and then the ozone layer) by setting limits on how much sulphur dioxide every company could emit. If you needed to emit more than your limit, you bought credits from a company that had managed to emit less. The benefits of emitting less and the cost of emitting more rapidly drove down emissions. The plan was to do the same thing for greenhouse gases on a global scale.', 'But 13 years later, intense disagreement over the global carbon market that would underpin Redd+ and other climate mitigation systems has meant it is the only part of the Paris agreement rulebook that governments are yet to agree. In the absence of a robust, internationally agreed system, small-scale unregulated forest protection projects have sprung up around the world, often known as “voluntary Redd+”.', 'There is no official certification system, but the most commonly used is Verra. Companies such as airlines, ice cream companies, banks – anyone who emits carbon and wants to offset their own emissions – give the NGOs money to carry on protecting the forest.', 'So far the market for carbon offsets has been small, at about $300m (£215m) in 2019. But during the last couple of years, a huge wave of corporate net zero strategies and carbon neutrality claims have changed the need for stringent carbon accounting for Redd+ credits. The former Bank of England governor Mark Carney is leading a taskforce to transform carbon offsetting into a multibillion-pound annual market. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has announced his intention to make London a global trading hub for voluntary offsets.', 'If these projects are to play the role outlined for them in the decarbonisation of the developed world, by providing offsets for major companies and helping to contribute to the net-zero journey, then it is vital that the methodologies they use in order to calculate the reduction in emissions are rigorous and accurate.', 'Currently, Verra has a number of requirements for projects that it will agree to certify and there are several methodologies that can be used. Generally, each Redd+ project must measure deforestation and land use changes in a reference region, a much larger area that is judged representative of the scheme that often includes the project. They must also document environmental threats from nearby areas, their conservation activities, the ecological makeup of the area, and the likely effect of the Redd+ project on the communities that live in and around it, in many cases by projecting historical trends into the future.', 'The number of carbon credits generated by a project depends on the difference between its prediction of deforestation and what actually happens. Verra says its methodologies are conservative by design to ensure counterfactual predictions are realistic. The claims are then checked by an approved third party auditor to see if they have followed the methodology correctly.', 'The Guardian and Unearthed looked at 10 projects, which supply credits to six major airlines, including British Airways and easyJet, to assess, as best we could with the help of experts and commissioned satellite analysis, exactly how realistic their predictions were. Although this is not a comprehensive analysis of voluntary Redd+ projects, these projects make up 10 of the 79 that Verra oversees, so an analysis will give some helpful insight into the functioning of the larger sector. We looked at the tools they had used for their predictions, and at the outcomes to date.', 'The investigation found an inconsistent use of predictive methods and tools. Two of the projects had used Dinamica EGO to estimate where deforestation would take place given threats to the environment. Soares-Filho cautioned against its use for Redd+ projects, and said the modelling approach of calculating forward-looking baselines resulted in “phantom credits” because the software was not designed to accurately predict the future.', 'Two had modelled deforestation and land use change using a tool that allows them to assume a massive rise in the rate of deforestation compared with the historical rate.', 'One project had used a simple single variable model, which predicted a large increase in deforestation in the absence of the project. Another two had built their own models – one claiming the entire rainforest would be gone without them, another claiming that about a quarter would go. Another adopted a baseline from the national government. One said it would prevent large amounts of deforestation with sustainable nut farming, another with a mixture of planned logging and forestry protection.', 'We looked at the previous deforestation rates in and around the projects, and compared them with the predicted rates. Here, we found that where we were able to compare, the projects had generally predicted deforestation rates that seemed inconsistent with previous rates.', 'One project forecast an annual rate that was triple that in the worst year before it started. One in a remote, inaccessible part of the jungle was basing its predictions on the rate of deforestation either side of a major road. Another was looking after an area which had been converted into a national park and where there had been no illegal deforestation for years. Despite this, it predicted a huge increase in deforestation if the project was not there.', 'One had very low rates of deforestation before the project started but forecast high annual rates without it, while another had adopted a generally conservative approach. It was impossible to assess the forecasts of five projects because of technical limitations and methodologies they had used.', 'Four schemes had made deforestation predictions about their project area and a surrounding reference region that we could easily examine. We asked MIS to assess tree cover loss in the reference areas of all four projects, excluding the project areas (for a number of reasons it was not appropriate or possible to examine all 10). If tree cover is lower in that area it could indicate that the original predictions were inaccurate and deforestation baselines were inflated.', 'However, as Verra, GFW and some of the projects pointed out to us, it could also indicate that the projects had been much more successful than originally expected, and that the work to reduce deforestation within the projects had spilled over into the surrounding area, reducing deforestation across the region.', 'The MIS analysis did, indeed, find that deforestation in the reference regions was far lower than predicted; in two projects the actual rate of deforestation, according to the MIS figures, was around a third of the predicted rate. In another it was half, while in a third it was just one-fifth. But the difficulty in assessing the meaning of this information highlights a fundamental problem with the accounting system.', 'We spoke with all the projects about their challenges and benefits of their work. “[We are dealing with] aggressive cattle ranchers and loggers, corrupt government officials, coca plantations and local drug cartels, extreme poverty, tropical storms, forest fires, perverse land use policies, and now climate change,” one project told us.', 'Several said they were protecting precious ecosystems with rare wildlife, and their activities helped support their survival. “We rely on the voluntary carbon market to pay forest communities for the environmental services they provide for the global community, which include protecting the forest, reducing carbon emissions,” another said. “We use the best science available, and comply with agreed and third-party verified protocols to produce carbon credits that vouch for the environmental services that are being delivered.”', 'The carbon credits were a vital source of finance for almost all the projects. One said they had filled the gap after western donor funding dried up. Another said the money from credits helped support communities that otherwise would not have an outside source of income. Some Redd+ projects were for-profit schemes and said criticisms of the system were ideological.', 'Unfortunately, no comprehensive scientific assessment has yet been published on how forest-based carbon offsetting projects affect deforestation. This year, researchers at the University of Cambridge are expected to publish a first-of-its-kind study assessing how well Redd+ projects stop and slow deforestation.', 'The 2020 study by West, which was published in PNAS, assessed 12 Verra-approved Redd+ schemes in the Brazilian Amazon to analyse how claimed emissions reductions matched up with reality.', 'To do so, researchers compared deforestation trends in Redd+ projects with control groups with similar characteristics, finding the schemes had routinely overstated their emissions reductions. The study found that reductions in deforestation were almost all due to national-level policies such as the 2006 soy moratorium in the Amazon that caused spectacular drops in deforestation, not the projects.', 'Although the 12 projects claimed 24.8m tonnes of emissions reductions using Verra methodologies, deforestation rates in 11 of them showed no difference with control groups in the study. For the one project that did, authors said 40% of the claimed emissions were overstated.', 'In a statement, Verra said it was concerned that the Guardian did not understand how its methodologies worked, or the VCS rules, the investigation was “fatally flawed” and had not produced fact-based journalism, ignoring its success at preserving standing trees. The organisation disputed the independence of the investigation and described it as a “hit piece” because of Greenpeace’s opposition to carbon credits, adding that many of the criticisms were outdated and did not reflect what was currently happening with Redd+ carbon credits. Finally, Verra said the journalism was dangerous as it threatened finance for preserving standing forests and was more akin to a political campaign.', 'Verra is making substantial changes to the way projects generate credits to comply with likely changes if disagreements over the Paris agreement rulebook covering nation-level Redd+ are resolved. Projects will be “nested” in national and regional systems and will derive credits from a nationally allocated baseline. The organisation has developed a new risk-mapping tool to highlight areas most at risk of deforestation. Verra said credits generated using previous methodologies would not be retired.', 'In response to the findings of the investigation, airlines said they trusted the quality of Redd+ credits they used for climate commitments, which were often sourced through a third party. EasyJet, which offsets fuel emissions on behalf of all customers for “carbon-neutral flying”, said it was an interim measure while zero-emission technology was developed and the airline was confident the projects it supported were in effect preventing forest loss.', 'British Airways said it was committed to net zero emissions by 2050 and offsetting remained a key part of its near-term plan while alternatives to fossil fuels were developed.', 'Delta said Verra’s methodologies were rigorous and science-based, also adding that it was investing in low-carbon technologies. Other airlines echoed these comments and said the use of offsets was an intermediary measure.', 'Additional reporting by SourceMaterial, a non-profit investigative journalism organisation.']",['Patrick Greenfield'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e58f4552446902f63d14ce680fd51c77bce757c9/0_1_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'Tropical forests in Costa Rica'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/065c5fb0ff7f59ceae9292561c5713060eb99779/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'A eucalyptus plantation'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d82cc0bd7e2897545614b7a4e3389a485bcd38fa/0_0_3320_2213/master/3320.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Illegal logging - such as this shipment seized by Amazon Military Police in Brazil last year- is a critical threat to forests.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b452095856990057f3816ac34decfea932792eda/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Here, a burnt area of the Amazon is seen during an operation to combat illegal logging.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e700313c591f1679d76c45261f3e6aece5b303b/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Timber planks at an illegal logging site in the Philippines.']]",

And workers are pushing back', 'Amazon, the world’s most powerful corporation, is an iceberg. Users and consumers see its top: the shops, the streaming service, the packages. But below the surface lies an enormous infrastructure, stretching across continents, linking production, distribution and delivery. A complex transnational system, populated by workers around the world whose labor drives Amazon’s profits.', 'Its chief executive and founder, Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest man, tries to conceal this system with the comfort and entertainment his services offer. The reason is equally clear and outrageous. From the factories where the products it sells are made, to the doorsteps where they are delivered, Amazon’s global infrastructure is held together by the exploitation of those who operate it.', 'Throughout Amazon’s supply chain, Bezos’s behemoth violates workers’ safety, dignity and privacy, putting them to work in worksites designed to squeeze as much labor out of them for as little money as possible. Workers do not take this lying down. Supported by a myriad of progressive allies, there is labor resistance all over Amazon’s global map, with strikes and protests from Spain to São Paulo, from Delhi to Berlin. On Black Friday last year, as scrutiny over Amazon’s anti-union practices, environmental impact, tax avoidance and worker safety intensified in Europe and the United States, UNI Global Union, IndustriaALL, Progressive International, Oxfam, Greenpeace and dozens of civil society organizations, environmentalists and tax watchdogs organized protest actions in 12 countries, uniting under the banner of Make Amazon Pay.', 'Aided by shocking media reports about dangerous and even dehumanizing working conditions, this activism draws attention to Amazon’s treatment of the warehouse workers who stow, store and sort its signature packages. As a result, the corporation’s efforts to conceal its conduct in this part of its global empire are faltering. In the UK, where most Amazon workers are employed in the corporation’s so-called “Fulfillment Centers”, a poll late last year found that only 24% of respondents believed Amazon treated its workers fairly. In the US, where Amazon recently worked to undermine a union campaign in Alabama with tactics that union leaders say prevented a free and fair election and violated federal law, almost 80% of respondents supported the warehouse workers’ struggle.', 'In the delivery part of Amazon’s empire, too, workers resist Amazon’s mistreatment. Delivery workers in India recently struck in Bengaluru, Delhi, Hyderabad and Pune, demanding better pay and employee benefits. During a ground-breaking national strike in Italy, 75% of all Amazon workers in the country stopped work, bringing together warehouse and delivery workers in an inspiring example of cross-supply chain solidarity. Recently, the shockingly common outrage of workers having to pee in bottles due to a lack of adequate break time went viral, bringing delivery workers into the fold of a common front taking on Amazon, and helping expand the public’s conception of Amazon’s workforce.', 'However, a crucial part of Amazon’s global infrastructure remains largely concealed. The self-styled Everything Store does not just sell, store and ship products – it also directly sources them. The corporation owns more than 400 private-label brands, selling a wide range of products from garments to electronics. From its Kindle e-readers to its rising apparel empire, Amazon is now the top fashion retailer in the United States – Amazon’s brands draw on an extensive network of some 1,400 factories worldwide.', 'Located mostly in countries in the global south, workers in these factories typically work in dire conditions. In Chinese factories producing Amazon devices like Echo and Alexa, investigations have revealed numerous illegal practices, from endless night shifts to underpayment. Last year, the absence of adequate health and safety measures in a Guatemala factory producing garments for Amazon brands saw a major Covid outbreak, endangering the lives of hundreds of workers. As a recent report by the Worker Rights Consortium revealed, Amazon is among a number of powerful multinationals refusing to make sure factory workers laid off during the pandemic get the severance pay they are still owed.', 'Amazon is responsible for what happens in the worksites that make up its global empire – and must be held accountable in and across all its regions. Workers themselves are at the forefront of the struggle to make this happen. Like warehouse and delivery workers, factory workers in the last concealed part of Amazon’s global system of exploitation are taking on the corporation. Unionized garment workers who lost their jobs in October when Amazon’s supplier Global Garments closed are demanding the factory reopen, rehire the 1,200 union members and provide them with back pay. In Cambodia, former workers at Amazon’s supplier Hulu Garment are calling on Amazon to ensure their full legally owed severance.', 'Workers across Amazon’s supply chain share the same struggle.

Others depict bustling riverside encampments where the garimpeiros live and work, featuring bars, restaurants, shops, houses and even a snooker table.

These mines are worth millions … It is truly frightening. They are just huge.”', 'Braga said the miners he saw at work in the Yanomami reserve, which is the same size as Portugal, bore no relation to those who once used steel pans to hunt for gold in remote Amazon rivers.', '“That’s history; nowadays the mines are insane. These guys are organised. They’ve got planes. They got antennas. They’ve got satellite TV, motorbikes, quad bikes, planes, helicopters, air conditioning, generators.

The report, which also used satellite imagery, claimed last year there was a 30% increase in deforestation within the reserve compared with 2019, with about 500 hectares of forest razed – the equivalent of about 500 football pitches. Another 200 hectares were destroyed in the first three months of this year.', 'Estêvão Senra, one of the report’s authors, said an “environmental and human tragedy” was under way in the reserve where an estimated 27,000 Yanomami live, largely isolated from the rest of Brazil.', '“The destruction caused by illegal mining this year could break last year’s record, which was already very dramatic,” said Senra, a geographer who is tracking the miners’ advance through Yanomami territory. “Business is booming and this is extremely worrying.”', 'Indigenous activists describe the crisis as the territory’s most troubling moment since the late 1980s and 1990s when tens of thousands of wildcat miners poured into the reserve bringing with them violence and diseases to which many Yanomami lacked immunity.

Our relatives were massacred. The garimpeiros killed a lot,” the 37-year-old said, adding: “It feels like we’re facing the same crisis today.”', 'The sense of emergency has intensified in recent weeks after deadly clashes between miners and Yanomami and a gun battle between federal police agents and heavily armed gunmen apparently linked to the mines. “There are signs the situation may become even more complicated [than in the 1980s],” Senra said.', 'In a recent interview the anthropologist Ana Maria Machado, who works with the Yanomami, called the region “a pressure cooker about to explode” and claimed Brazil’s president shouldered part of the blame because he had encouraged the invading miners. “Bolsonaro gives a green light to all types of illegality in the reserves,” Machado said.']","['Tom Phillips', 'Flávia Milhorance']",,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab3af563226dcfb144cbc8e919f39f3897233d64/0_68_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=480&dpr=1&s=none', 'One of the illegal gold mines in the Uraricoera river region of the Yanomami reserve '], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfac447d9eba13df68fd95a2ab467162ac980f53/0_0_2000_1335/master/2000.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'An illegal gold mine in the Uraricoera river region of the Yanomami reserve.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd6651a2489cfb9ed64a1b17c9646e10e6048a37/0_0_2000_1333/master/2000.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'An area of rainforest destroyed by goldminers in the Apiaú region of the Yanomami reserve.']]",
