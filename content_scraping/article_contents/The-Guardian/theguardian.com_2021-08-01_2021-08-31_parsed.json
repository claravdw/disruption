It has made ambitious pledges to hit peak emissions by 2030 and be carbon neutral by 2060, but still drawn warnings that it may not be possible under their current trajectory.\\nBeijing is far from alone in being accused of doing too little in the face of climate change, but inside China any attempt to criticise the government for inaction is increasingly dangerous.Marches and protests seen over the world calling for greater action against an existential threat are largely impossible in China.\\n\u201cTo [criticise the government] publicly\u2026 There will be consequences, they will come one day,\u201d says a former Chinese environmental journalist who now lives overseas. \u201cIt could be a removal of your operational license or just harassment of individual employees.\u201d\\nAmid a nationwide crackdown on dissent and activism \u2013 including LGBTQ rights, feminism, human rights, political freedoms and environmentalism \u2013 activists and non-government organisations fear expulsion, harassment, or worse if they criticise the government.\\nIn recent years authorities have arrested countless environmental protesters, whistleblowers and concerned citizens. They are often charged with the ubiquitous catch-all of \u201cpicking quarrels and provoking trouble\u201d, a crime frequently levelled against pesky activists. Some, like Ou Hongyi, China\u2019s answer to Greta Thunberg, have left the country and now lobby from the outside.\\n\u201cWith all these examples of the suppression of people just holding different opinions to the central government, there is fear growing,\u201d the former journalist says.\\nCurrent and former environmental activists and journalists, many of whom declined to go on the record for fear of repercussion, described to the Guardian a sector working quietly and fearfully to navigate a government hypersensitive to any criticism.\\nThe former journalist says just a decade ago was a \u201cgolden time\u201d for environmental journalism and activism, where investigations and campaigns \u2013 while risky and still bound by red tape \u2013 were often tolerated and saw results. Now, NGOs are just trying to survive, eking what they can from a government which won\u2019t abide criticism of any kind.\\n\u201c[Climate activism] exists in China, but it\u2019s not the same format, or the same perception of western democratic environmentalism. It\u2019s environmentalism with Chinese characteristics,\u201d she says.\\n\u201cThe thing is you have to show you\u2019re willing to cooperate, and that you come with constructive criticisms, and you follow the government agenda \u2013 say the 2030/2060 carbon goals. You don\u2019t say \u2018it\u2019s too late\u2019, you say \u2018here is our proposal\u2019.\u201d\\nIt leaves international NGOs in a tricky spot, having to balance the benefits of a local presence with having to keep quiet.\\nDr Liu Junyan, head of Greenpeace\u2019s climate risk project in Beijing, says most environmental movements are driven by the government or elites, and others have to work on the sidelines educating community leaders to filter concerns up through the ranks, hoping the government eventually adopts it for their agenda.\\n\u201cWe are trying to figure out unique engagement pathways. I don\u2019t think many NGOs especially international NGOs, have found the pathway,\u201d Liu says.\\nIt worked for air pollution campaigns around 2012, when the public and then the government got behind it as a health issue, she says.\\nSome, like leading Chinese environmentalist, Ma Jun, have come up with innovative ways using government data to shame polluters and emitters without crossing government red lines. Private meetings can also go a long way if local officials are open-minded and willing to talk, but if not, there\u2019s little one can do.\\n\u201cYou can not get the Chinese government to do anything if they don\u2019t listen to you,\u201d says the head of a Chinese NGO, which specialises in community education.\\nBut a major impediment is low awareness of the climate crisis among the general population, thanks to muzzled activists, online censorship, and little focus on the issues by the media and education system. Searches for \u201cChina global warming\u201d on government news sites return nothing.\\n\u201cI think basic education should include climate change, it is a very important topic to educate students,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, when we go to school and try to share our knowledge, we find that even the teachers don\u2019t have a deep understanding of climate change.\u201d\\nLiu says there has been improvements, and after Xi announced his carbon pledges there was a noticeable willingness in state media to finally discuss climate change. But still, \u201cthe bulk of the general public have a limited idea of what climate change is and a low perception of how it will affect their lives. [It means] there is limited activism from the bottom up\u201d.\\nState media coverage of the report noted the devastating climate disasters of recent months in China. But it also largely praised or avoided mentioning China\u2019s efforts, and calls for action highlighted the inadequacies of foreign governments or societies instead.\\n\u201cHave you counted the wild fire carbon emission in United States, Australia and Canada?\u201d one commenter said.\\n\u201cIt will improve a lot if American eat less beef and avocados,\u201d said another.\\nThe former journalist doesn\u2019t know where \u201cactivism with Chinese characteristics\u201d goes from here, and says her generation of environmentalists have largely walked away from it. She questions whether the young people like Ou actually benefit from having grown up in the harsher, propaganda-heavy environment.\\n\u201cMaybe for young people like her who never experienced the frustrations we had, who never had the contrast of being able to express a little bit to not being able to express at all, they were not traumatised,\u201d she says.\\n\u201cThis might be a pattern of young Chinese who grow up and live abroad, participating\u2026 and joining the international wave of activism. Because fundamentally climate change is not just a Chinese issue, it\u2019s a global issue.\u201d", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9f8da66a671ef13cd8c111fa3093fe5afdaac7d/0_349_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Ou Hongyi, aged 17, stages a protest on a street in Guilin, as the first young person in China to participate in Greta Thunberg-inspired schools climate strikes."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/398837d7876d21fe1cb9b403dc0e350d039309c8/0_165_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Flooding in Xinxiang in central China\u2019s Henan Province in June.

Here she recounts the pivotal role the protest played in their lives\\nIn September 1981, 32 women, four men and several children marched from Cardiff to Berkshire to protest over nuclear weapons being sited at RAF Greenham Common. The following year, the founders declared the camp \u201cwomen only\u201d, and the Greenham Common Women\u2019s Peace Camp became one of the longest and most famous examples of feminist protest in recent history.\\nThe camp was set up outside the RAF base to protest against US nuclear weapons on British common land. Facing police and soldiers, the women sang: \u201cAre you on the side of suicide, are you on the side of homicide, are you on the side of genocide, which side are you on?\u201d\\nAs a child, Rebecca Mordan was taken to Greenham by her mother. \u201cHer mind was completely blown and radicalised,\u201d says Mordan. \u201cShe was on the telephone tree and watched the tents at night so the women could sleep. She was at the \u2018University of Feminism\u2019.\u201d\\nAlong with dozens of women, over nine days, Mordan is retracing the original route taken from Cardiff in 1981, arriving at Greenham Common this Friday. A weekend of festivities on the common will build up to the anniversary two days later.\\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want women to die and take their Greenham stories with them,\u201d says Mordan, who built the website Greenham Women Everywhere, and co-authored a book, Out of the Darkness, based on stories from the camp. In the years between 1981 and 2000, when the camp was handed back to locals, more than 70,000 women demonstrated, danced, sang and took direct action such as taking bolt cutters to fences and storming the watchtowers. It was the largest female-led protest since the women\u2019s suffrage movement in the 1900s.\\n\u201cThe cruise missiles did go, international law did change, the common was handed back to the people, the camp cost millions of pounds for the Americans, and these women spoke at the UN. Thousands and thousands of women were radicalised, even those who only came for a weekend. It opened their minds to their oppression, introduced middle-class women to working-class women. It was proper intersectional feminism,\u201d says Mordan.\\nThe Greenham camp and its slogans, \u201cArms are for linking\u201d and \u201cFight war, not wars\u201d, soon became an embarrassment to the British and US governments.\\nIn 1982, when I joined 30,000 women travelling to Greenham to \u201cembrace the base\u201d, the only means of publicity had been a chain letter sent via women\u2019s groups. \u201cPeople \u2026 hear about Greenham and think \u2018middle-aged women\u2019 and immediately shutdown,\u201d says Mordan.\\nHowever, women of all ages, classes and circumstances came to Greenham. \u201cWe need to preserve the heritage of Greenham women. Kids and young people always say, \u2018Why don\u2019t we know about this?\u2019 It\u2019s cultural robbery,\u201d says Stephanie Davies, former Greenham woman and author of Other Girls Like Me.\\n\u201cWhen people talk about Extinction Rebellion, they talk about the suffragettes, but they don\u2019t mention the Greenham women,\u201d says Davies. \u201cThe camp provided me with a safe space from male violence, and I saw that with many other women there, especially those that escaped abusive relationships.\u201d\\nI remember going to the women-only club Rackets in Islington on Friday nights. A van-load of Greenham women would turn up and have a wash in the toilets before wildly dancing and drinking pints. They were instantly recognisable with their colourful mohawks and grubby clothes smelling of woodsmoke. By living at the camp, many heterosexual, married women realised they didn\u2019t have to bother with men at all and took up relationships with women. Much of the tabloid media was prejudicial and referred to Greenham inhabitants as \u201cdirty, filthy lesbians\u201d \u2013 it was handy to condemn leftwing feminists and anti-war activists with one toxic slur.\\nGreenham was never my cup of tea. I was campaigning to end rape and domestic violence during those years, and the nurturing, caring objectives of women fighting for peace fitted the sexist stereotypes of women. Camping in freezing weather and eating endless lentil stew added a further deterrent.\\nNevertheless, I was drawn to the idea of Greenham because, for one thing, lesbianism and close relationships between women became normalised, with the possibility of alternative relationships opening up to women who might never have considered it. This was a time when homophobia was rampant, ahead of section 28, and lesbians were losing custody of their children to violent spouses.\\nAnother appeal was how activists made connections between policing, militarism, war and everyday male violence towards women.\\nDespite the camp, the first cruise missiles came to Greenham in 1983, but protests continued through the 80s, with many women taken to court, fined and even jailed. The signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty between the US and Russia in 1987 paved the way for the removal of cruise missiles from Greenham between 1989 and 1991. The US air force left the base in 1992, followed by the UK. The peace camp remained as a continuing protest against nuclear weapons until 2000.\\nNow part of Greenham is a business park and the rest is common land.\\nRebecca Johnson arrived at the camp in 1982 and lived there for five years. She is the director and founder of the Acronym Institute for Disarmament Diplomacy, co-founder of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, and vice-president of CND.\\n\u201cMany of us came for the nuclear weapons and stayed for the feminism.

The bill seeks to quietly criminalise \u201cserious annoyance\u201d, increase police powers to restrict protests, and give the home secretary discretion over what types of protests are allowed.\\nIt is striking that such an enormous bill had its second reading less than a week after it was published and was only allocated two days of debate. It appears that the government had hoped to pass it quickly and without fanfare, but instead the introduction of the bill coincided with the fallout from the police response to the Sarah Everard vigil and ultimately sparked in Bristol the very thing it sought to limit: protests.\\nClauses 55 and 56 of the bill will make it easier for the police to impose conditions on marches and static protests, removing the distinction between the two. Where before, protests would have to threaten serious public disorder to warrant certain restrictions, under this bill police could intervene merely if the protest was noisy enough to cause a person in the vicinity \u201cserious unease\u201d.\\nFurther, the range of conditions that may be imposed would be increased. Where before police could only rule on the place, duration and number of persons attending a protest, under this bill, the police would be able to impose any condition they thought necessary. As Liberty, the civil liberties organisation, points out, this would give the police the power to ban static protests altogether.\\nThis is significant because breaching one of these conditions is a criminal offence, and the bill also lowers the threshold for committing such an offence and increases the maximum penalty. Whereas before, someone would have to actually know that the condition had been imposed by the police, under this bill organisers can be prosecuted if they merely ought to have known, and could end up facing nearly a year in prison.\\nThis bill would make it a crime to cause \u201cserious annoyance\u201d to the public, with a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. However, one of the most worrying powers created by the bill gives the home secretary control over the definition of \u201cserious disruption to the life of the community\u201d and \u201cserious disruption to the activities of an organisation\u201d, both of which can determine when police powers to limit protest are engaged. This power effectively grants a minister the ability to suppress the kinds of protests that he or she does not like or agree with.\\nIn the debate on the bill, even former Conservative prime minister Theresa May, herself an ex-home secretary, pointedly commented: \u201cIt is tempting when home secretary to think that giving powers to the home secretary is very reasonable \u2013 because we all think we\u2019re reasonable. But actually future home secretaries may not be so reasonable.\u201d\\nThe government refers to the 2019 Extinction Rebellion protests and the recent \u201cKill the Bill\u201d protests in Bristol as justifying these new powers. After all, given the images of a seemingly beleaguered police force struggling to defend itself against a mob who have set fire to vans, with officers suffering broken bones and a collapsed lung, ought we not to give the police the tools to fight back?\\nExcept that it turns out that the media coverage of the Bristol protests has been misleading, the Avon and Somerset police admitted there had not been any broken bones or punctured lungs and the locals in Bristol tell a very different story of heavy-handed police tactics. In addition, it has been reported that far more protesters than police were injured.\\nThe reality is that the police do not need more powers to limit protests, as much as they might like them. Even if all of the protesters in Bristol were being as violent as the initial reports claimed, there are already laws in place to deal with that behaviour. The clauses in this bill about noise, inconvenience and annoyance betray what it is really trying to do: keep those pesky protesters away from the places they will have the most impact. That way, the government will not have to worry about protests the next time they do such things as authorise police informants to commit torture or excuse soldiers for historic war crimes.\\nMake no mistake, this bill is not about law and order, it is about state control and the subtle erosion of freedom of expression. Protests are supposed to be loud and inconvenient; they would not be particularly effective otherwise. As Theresa May put it: \u201cThere will be people who will have seen scenes of protests and asked, \u2018Why aren\u2019t the government doing something?\u2019 The answer, in many cases, may simply be that we live in a democratic, free society.\u201d\\nJoshua Clements has just completed his final exams on the ICCA bar course.

A number of activists remained inside the bus and locked beneath.\\nA Met statement said given the demonstration was an \u201cattempt to cause major disruption to one of London\u2019s busiest bridges\u201d the use of force \u201cwas reasonable and proportionate\u201d.

It was commissioned by 195 governments and all of them signed off on the conclusions after reviewing them line by line and word by word. These governments, whether supportive, ambivalent or hostile to climate action, now own the messages in the report. So what does it say?\\nThe report concludes that there is now \u201cunequivocal\u201d evidence that human actions are changing our climate. Behind this are alarming findings. The burning of fossil fuels and deforestation has led to levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that are higher today than at any time in the past 2 million years. Alongside methane and other greenhouse gases, this has driven Earth to be warmer than at any point in the past 125,000 years. The impacts of this can be seen in the loss of Arctic sea ice, accelerating sea level rise, hotter and more frequent heatwaves, increased and more frequent extreme rainfall events and, in some regions, more intense droughts and fires.\\nAs scientists, we can now clearly and unambiguously join all the dots, linking these \u201cclimate-impact drivers\u201d back to global heating and carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use. Today\u2019s global temperature rise of 1.1C above pre-industrial levels confirms the predictions of climate scientists more than 30 years ago.

As a result, the climate emergency is no longer a future hypothesis: it is with us here and now.\\nGlobal emissions of carbon dioxide are rising again after their temporary fall during the Covid lockdowns. According to the International Energy Authority, unless new policies are enforced, CO2 emissions will probably hit record levels in 2023. And, as if that were not enough bad news, extreme heatwaves, rainfall events and droughts will get worse until carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions are reduced to zero.\\nIt is hard to make sense of all this. How do we even think of a time as hot as 125,000 years ago? At that point, humans were coexisting with Neanderthals. As much carbon dioxide as two million years ago? Our species hadn\u2019t even evolved by then. It is no wonder these incredible changes feel existential. But we must urgently make sense of them, and act fast.\\nThe problem is ultimately that the use of fossil fuels is a \u201cprogress trap\u201d. Decades ago, fossil fuels improved lives compared alternative energy sources, but now their use does the opposite, actively destroying lives and livelihoods. Fossil fuels have gone from an ingenious enabler of human progress to a trap that undermines it. The climate crisis is not caused by vague \u201chuman actions\u201d; nor is it a result of some innate aspect of human nature. It is caused by specific investments by specific people in specific things. Change those, and we can change the future.\\nIt may feel uncomfortable saying that fossil fuel companies, their investors and the politicians who enable them are the enemies of progress. But if we care about our collective future we need to say it, again and again, without flinching: using fossil fuels today is destroying our future.\\nThe fossil fuel industry is a powerful and complex enemy. Historically, it is where the world\u2019s most influential lobbyists have worked. Their efforts have secured subsidies, military campaigns and a free licence to pollute, all justified in the name of access to fossil energy. Oil, coal and gas are also intimately involved in our lives, from heating our homes to powering transport. There is no single policy, technological breakthrough or activist campaign that alone can help us escape this trap.\\nInstead we need a three-pronged attack on fossil fuels: target the industry directly, join broad social movements to secure the political changes needed to end the fossil fuel era and make changes to reduce our demand for fossil fuels. That might mean asking your pension provider to divest from fossil fuels, joining the next Extinction Rebellion protest or replacing your polluting gas cooker with a modern electric one. In this, there is a role for everyone.\\nWhat also matters is talking about the climate emergency and the urgent need to end the fossil fuel era. We should be bringing this up at home, at work, at school and with our friends. While the sweeping changes needed must ultimately come from government regulation, it is us who must demonstrate that the desire for change exists.\\nThe new sixth assessment report was not all bad news. It included one unambiguously positive finding: the level of devastation we face is in our collective hands. If the world slashes emissions now and reduces them to net zero by 2050 we would keep the global temperature rise close to 1.5C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.\\nTo achieve this, politicians will need to hear that the clamour of millions of people\u2019s voices is greater than the might of the fossil fuel lobby. Governments accept the science of climate change. Now they need to be forced to act on what they know is true, and help us escape the fossil fuel progress trap.\\nSimon Lewis is professor of global change science at University College London and University of Leeds", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/888a7cc0d68fa63c250ac7a7f01ce34c4d26fe89/0_3_3543_2125/master/3543.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "A wildfire raging in Gerania, Greece, May 2021."]], "author": ["Simon Lewis"], "date": "2021-08-10"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/27/extinction-rebellion-targets-city-of-london-in-blood-money-protest": {"title": "Extinction Rebellion targets City of London in \u2018blood money\u2019 protest", "subtitle": null, "text": "Activists tour financial institutions to highlight firms they believe to be culpable in climate crisis\\n\\nExtinction Rebellion protesters poured red paint over the entrances of City institutions as they marched through London\u2019s financial district in a protest against the \u2018\u201cblood money\u201d on which they say the UK economy is built.\\nIn what appeared to be the biggest mobilisation so far this week by the environmental protest group, several thousand demonstrators took a tour of the City, stopping off at the banks and law firms they saw as most culpable in the climate crisis.\\nAll week, groups based on local areas, or around issues such as gender, race or politics, have staged actions in different locations in central London. On Friday, the protest was staged in solidarity with black, brown and indigenous people, especially in the developing world.\\nAfter rallying outside the Bank of England, protesters marched to Standard Chartered bank, where activists scaled the entrance and poured blood-red paint across its glass facade, to highlight the $31.4bn (\u00a323bn) they say it had invested in fossil fuels since the Paris climate accords.\\nActivists then went to the Guildhall, from where the financial district is governed, and sprayed the building with red paint.\\nAt 3pm, they reached Paternoster Square, where the London Stock Exchange is located, for rallies and a speech. A mass civil disobedience was planned.\\n\u201cToday\u2019s protest is highlighting that racial, social and climate justice are all intertwined,\u201d said Bhavini Patel, from east London, an activist with XR Unify. \u201cThere is no separation and we recognise that, because where\u2019s that profit going and how does it impact us?\\n\u201cProfit extraction has meant that there has been racial inequality, social inequality and climate collapse. It\u2019s interlinked, and if we want justice we need to be demanding justice for all three things, so that we are equal as people.\u201d\\nFriday was the fifth day of XR\u2019s fourth London \u201crebellion\u201d, the term it uses for the two-week carnival of protest and civil disobedience that has become one of its trademark strategies. Demonstrators had already carried out street blockades in Covent Garden, Whitehall, the West End and Oxford Circus. On Thursday, animal rights activists stained the fountains outside Buckingham Palace red.\\nThe group\u2019s strategy has been different this year. Whereas in previous rebellions, activists had sought to take and hold key sites in the capital, this time they have staged pop-up occupations, targeting high-footfall sites in the hope of engaging as many people as possible in \u201ccrisis talks\u201d about the state of the environment, and what to do about it.\\nFriday\u2019s protest marked an inflection point, with XR using the following week to specifically target the City and financial institutions that are funding fossil fuels, and to drive home its key demand: stop all financing of fossil fuels projects immediately.\\n\u201cWe knew it was going to be more difficult to hold major sites, we haven\u2019t been able to do that for a while, so for us moving around and being agile and adaptable has felt really important,\u201d Alannah Byrne, of XR\u2019s media team, said. \u201cIt also means we can tell more of a story and target different places and highlight the issues in more places.\u201d\\nThe Metropolitan police\u2019s tactics have also changed. Initially, police tried to block access to protests, but it soon became clear officers were causing more of a disruption than they were preventing. Instead, they moved to attempting to cordon off and isolate XR\u2019s protest structures, and the activists locked on to them.\\nLock-ons have been at the core of XR\u2019s strategy since it began, but locked-on activists need support from other activists, to bring them food and drink, shelter them from the elements, keep them company, and sometimes to surreptitiously swap places.\\nOnce protest apparatuses have been secured, police have imposed section 14 orders to place restrictions on the protests and demand participants leave.\\nDespite that more aggressive approach to trying to nip XR\u2019s actions in the bud, there have been fewer arrests this year, with only 289 as of Thursday afternoon, according to the Met.\\nWhether that was due to a change in police tactics was uncertain. Gail Bradbrook, one of XR\u2019s founders, said: \u201cI think it\u2019s to do with the numbers in XR at the minute who are willing and able to be arrested \u2013 pre-Covid, there were probably higher numbers,\u201d she said.\\n\u201cThere\u2019s something about people pacing themselves, and resilience. My personal view is that the movement went through a period of contraction. But I think it\u2019s got stronger foundations and it\u2019s going through a period of growth.\u201d\\nRichard Ecclestone, a former police inspector with Devon and Cornwall police who acts as XR\u2019s police liaison, said he felt the Met gold commander\u2019s promise to the group of a \u201csafety-first\u201d policing approach had been broken in the rush to suppress occupations.\\nHe cited examples where police rushing to control areas had reportedly pulled apart women who were glued together or risked toppling a ladder being scaled by activists. In another case, he said, a locked-on protester surrounded by police had to be taken to hospital suffering from dehydration after officers failed to give them drinks.\\nThis article was amended on 28 August 2021 to correct the figure for the number of arrests made by the Met police.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/426de0ebe8fed0d348a8bb16b8c4263e6fa74cb7/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Protesters cover Paternoster Square in central London in fake blood and coins during an Extinction Rebellion  march"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d01a3aec16a40503da9e4ec721b5b7eec1cb613e/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Protesters and police in Paternoster Square"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d87e3887ee7a72a430cd16e8d06faa4d6bcf56c/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Extinction Rebellion activists target the City of London financial district"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95d79b81a106cbdfcbc2ffbe76bfdb1b577e95f5/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Red paint over a sign on the Guildhall sign during the Extinction Rebellion protest in London"]], "author": ["Damien Gayle"], "date": "2021-08-27"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/aug/31/coalition-mps-want-more-school-chaplains-to-help-children-suffering-mentally-due-to-climate-activism": {"title": "Coalition MPs want more school chaplains to help children suffering mentally due to \u2018alarmist\u2019 climate activism", "subtitle": null, "text": "MPs ask Scott Morrison to fund chaplains in every school, saying global warming alarmism is causing \u2018mental health problems\u2019 in young\\nCoalition MPs have urged Scott Morrison to increase funding to the government\u2019s school chaplaincy program to help address concerns that activism against global heating is causing mental health problems for Australian children.\\nIn the Coalition party room on Tuesday, Liberal MP Andrew Wallace compared children\u2019s fear of climate change with the threat of nuclear annihilation in the 1970s and 80s, and requested full funding for chaplains in every school to help ease concerns.\\nThe assistant youth minister, Luke Howarth, has backed the call to expand the program in comments to Guardian Australia, saying climate activism is \u201calarmist and does cause mental health problems for young people\u201d that could be helped by chaplains.\\nModerate Liberals interpret the push as preparation for increased funding to appease conservative party room members in the event the religious discrimination bill is stripped back.\\nThe chaplaincy program provides $20,000 to 3,100 schools towards the $45,000 annual cost of a chaplain.

It did not include a tax on utility vehicles.\\nWhile Morrison\u2019s campaign comments and the context surrounding them remain on the public record, the prime minister bristled at Bowen\u2019s question on Tuesday, declaring \u201cthe claim made by the questioner is false\u201d.\\nThe prime minister later made a personal explanation to parliament. Having appeared to query his \u201cend the weekend\u201d quote earlier in question time, Morrison acknowledged he had said \u201cBill Shorten wants to end the weekend\u201d.\\nBut he contended his criticism wasn\u2019t about electric vehicles, it was about \u201cLabor\u2019s bad policy\u201d.\\n\u201cThe point about it is not whether electric vehicles are good or bad,\u201d Morrison told parliament in his personal explanation. \u201cIn fact, they have a role to play increasingly in the vehicle fleet of Australia, over the next decade.\u201d\\nSince the Australian election, governments around the world have redoubled efforts to drive electrification of the vehicle fleet. The United States president, Joe Biden, last week foreshadowed an executive order which will attempt to make half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 electric, and the administration is pursuing new vehicle emissions standards.\\n\\nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\\nUnder sustained diplomatic pressure from key allies like the US and the United Kingdom, Morrison has been attempting to pivot on climate policy. He\u2019s been signalling Australia wants to reach net zero emissions as soon as possible and \u201cpreferably\u201d by 2050.\\nBut that shift has attracted pushback from the National party. Nationals senator Matt Canavan told reporters on Tuesday he \u201cremained opposed\u201d to a net zero target, claiming it would \u201csend thousands of Australian jobs to other countries\u201d.\\n\u201cI can\u2019t see any way I would support a proposal that would not improve the environment but would cost our own jobs,\u201d Canavan said.\\nEarlier, in the Coalition party room, Nationals senator Sam McMahon announced a plan to seek to amend the EPBC Act to remove the prohibition on nuclear power, and potentially support taxpayer underwriting of plants, which received support from Canavan.\\nThe pair later told the media the policy had been agreed by Nationals senators, which Guardian Australia understands occurred before the recent change in leadership back to Barnaby Joyce. Canavan conceded the nuclear push is unlikely to receive the necessary support, although McMahon claimed colleagues including some Liberals had supported it \u201cprivately\u201d.\\nIn New South Wales, the Liberal climate change minister, Matt Kean, meanwhile said Morrison needed to increase Australia\u2019s ambition.\\n\u201cThe federal government can do more,\u201d he told the ABC. \u201cI think you can set more ambitious targets.\u201d\\nMorrison often references the cost associated with action to reduce emissions. But Kean said the transition was an opportunity. He said Australia could be an \u201cenergy superpower in the low carbon economy that is coming\u201d.\\n\u201cIt will mean jobs, opportunity and prosperity for Australia.

The document, called the sixth assessment report, is divided into three parts: the physical science of climate change; the impacts and ways of reducing human influence on the climate.\\nPart three is not scheduled to be released before next March, but a small group of scientists decided to leak the draft via the Spanish branch of Scientist Rebellion, an offshoot of the Extinction Rebellion movement. It was first published by the journalist Juan Bordera in the Spanish online magazine CTXT.\\nBordera told the Guardian that the leak reflected the concern of some of those involved in drawing up the document that their conclusions could be watered down before publication in 2022. Governments have the right to make changes to the \u201csummary for policymakers\u201d.\\nThe top 10% of emitters globally, who are the wealthiest 10%, contribute between 36 and 45% of emissions, which is 10 times as much as the poorest 10%, who are responsible for only about three to 5%, the report finds. \u201cThe consumption patterns of higher income consumers are associated with large carbon footprints. Top emitters dominate emissions in key sectors, for example the top 1% account for 50% of emissions from aviation,\u201d the summary says.\\nThe report underlines the lifestyle changes that will be necessary, particularly in rich countries and among the wealthy globally. Refraining from over-heating or over-cooling homes, walking and cycling, cutting air travel and using energy-consuming appliances less can all contribute significantly to the reductions in emissions needed, the report finds.\\nEating patterns in many parts of the rich world will also need to change. \u201cA shift to diets with a higher share of plant-based protein in regions with excess consumption of calories and animal-source food can lead to substantial reductions in emissions, while also providing health benefits \u2026 Plant-based diets can reduce emissions by up to 50% compared to the average emission intensive western diet,\u201d the report says.\\nProviding modern energy to all those who currently lack it (800m people have no access to electricity) would have a \u201cnegligible\u201d effect on increasing emissions, the report notes.\\nCutting emissions in the next decade will be crucial to any hope of holding global heating within 1.5C of pre-industrial levels, beyond which the impacts of climate breakdown will cause widespread devastation. \u201cWeaker near-term action would place limiting warming to these levels out of reach, as it would entail assumptions about subsequent accelerated policy development and technology development and deployment, inconsistent with evidence and projections in the assessed literature,\u201d the report warns.\\nThe report reaffirms the need to halve emissions in the next decade to stay within 1.5C and reach net zero emissions by 2050.\\nThe investment needed to shift the global economy to a low-carbon footing is also missing. Current investment falls below what is needed \u201cby a factor of five\u201d, even to hold warming to the higher limit of 2C, according to the report. About $546bn went towards cutting greenhouse gases and building resilience to the impacts of the climate crisis in 2018.\\n\u201cExisting and planned infrastructure and investments, institutional inertia and a social bias towards the status quo are leading to a risk of locking in future emissions that may be costly or difficult to abate,\u201d the scientists say.\\nStranded assets will be a growing problem, as coal-fired and gas power plants with working lives usually measured in decades will have to be decommissioned within nine to 12 years of construction, the report finds. The scientists echo the recent advice from the International Energy Agency that no new fossil fuel development can take place if the world is to stay within 1.5C of heating.\\n\u201cThe combined economic impacts of stranded fossil fuel resources and capital could amount to trillions of dollars,\u201d the report says. This risk could be reduced by shifting investment to low carbon goods and services.\\nTechnology to capture and store carbon dioxide has not progressed rapidly enough to play a major role yet, the report also finds, but technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere would almost certainly be needed to hold heating to 1.5C.\\nThere are some causes for optimism, the report notes. Solar and wind energy and battery technology are now far cheaper, thanks to policies that have encouraged their use. Cutting methane emissions would also be a major contributor to dampening temperature rises.\\nTaking greater care of forests and land as important carbon sinks would also help to limit temperature rises, but must not be over-relied onThis comes at relatively low cost but cannot compensate for slow emissions reduction in other sectors, the report says.\\nCTXT, the Spanish publication that leaked the draft, said it showed that the global economy must be shifted rapidly away from a reliance on conventional GDP growth, but that the report underplays this. \u201cThe essential radical change in an economic system whose perverse operation of accumulation and reproduction of capital in perpetuity has brought us to the current critical point is not clearly mentioned,\u201d CTXT wrote.\\nThe IPCC said it did not comment on leaks, and the purpose of the drafting process was to give the scientists time and peace to develop their assessment without external comment.

Yet even though climate concerns are growing, it faces a raft of new challenges\\nGreen politics in Britain has always had a problem with scale. The disparity between the damage being done to the planet and the forces mobilised against it, in electoral politics and on the streets, has so far been painfully stark.\\nThe first British Green party (originally called the People party) was founded in the early 1970s, when anxiety about the environment was almost as widespread as it is now. Its initial election manifesto was based on A Blueprint for Survival \u2013 a bestselling book that warned of \u201cthe breakdown of society and the irreversible disruption of the life-support systems on this planet\u201d if the economic status quo continued. Yet it took another 37 years, until 2010, for Britain to elect its first Green MP, Caroline Lucas. The representative for Brighton Pavilion still remains the only Green in the Commons.\n  Our electoral system\u2019s hostility to new parties has obviously held the\n  Greens back. But so has the tendency of environmental emergencies to leave voters feeling overwhelmed and paralysed, or in denial. Meanwhile in protest politics, even the clarity and ingenuity of groups such as Extinction Rebellion often seem to have only a fleeting impact. When its city-centre roadblocks have been cleared away, the usual traffic and consumerism return, almost as if nothing has happened. Green politics, somehow both too big and too small to gain sustained mainstream attention, seems stuck in its niche.\n  But there are signs that this may finally be changing. Last week the Scottish Greens announced a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish National party. If it is accepted at a members\u2019 meeting on Saturday, the Scottish Greens will become the first British Green party to enter government.\\nIn England and Wales, the Greens already have a record number 0f councillors \u2013 477 \u2013 with the vast majority of them elected since 2019. In May, the party came second in Bristol\u2019s mayoral election  with 44% in the run-off vote. In national opinion polls, support for them has doubled since the last general election, when it was already at a historically high level, and they are now running neck and neck with the Liberal Democrats.\n  The wider political context is also unusually favourable. In November, Britain is to host the UN\u2019s climate conference. The government is talking a lot about the environment, while doing little. Meanwhile, Keir Starmer\u2019s cautious leadership is pushing many of Labour\u2019s younger, more radical supporters towards the Greens.\\nWith the Lib Dems still tainted by their coalition with the Tories and tuition fees U-turn, in England at least there is nowhere else for these young voters to go. And with Labour looking unlikely to win the next election, the usual left-of-centre argument that voting Green is a wasted vote loses some of its force.\\nAlready, the line between leftwing and green politics in Britain is increasingly blurred. In recent years many thinkers and activists of both persuasions have concluded that unrestrained capitalism is the main cause of the climate crisis; and that, since the crisis is being disproportionately worsened by the rich and visited on the poor, the main solution is state intervention to create a more equal as well as greener economy.\\nDuring Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, Labour became much more interested in the environment, and the Greens increasingly emphasised social justice. At the 2019 election, the two parties\u2019 manifestos were hard to tell apart. Conventional wisdom now dismisses Corbynism as a dead end, but in the Green party many of its more promising ideas live on.\n  All these party-political shifts are being accelerated by the climate crisis. When environmentalism took off in the 1970s, the fears that motivated it often came from futurology. Now they can come from watching the news, or just looking out the window. It\u2019s harder to dismiss the Greens as cranks, or their demands as political luxuries, when your garden is under water. \u201cIt would take an error for the party not to do very well in the next few years,\u201d says a former adviser to Lucas.\n  But greater relevance brings new pressures. One is for the party to actually look like Britain. \u201cIn 2015 we had less ethnic diversity than Ukip,\u201d says the former adviser. The party is bigger and broader now \u2013 in England and Wales it has at least a quarter as many members as the Tories \u2013 but it is still very white, especially compared with Labour.\n  Another challenge will be helping to govern Scotland. Being the SNP\u2019s junior partner will involve difficult compromises \u2013 for example over the SNP\u2019s plans to expand Scotland\u2019s network of roads \u2013 which some Scottish Greens are already anticipating and criticising. Governing on a much smaller scale has already been what you might call a learning experience. In Brighton, the Greens\u2019 longstanding stronghold, where as well as Lucas\u2019s constituency the party controls the council, the Greens have stopped the municipal use of weedkillers. After a summer of unusually intense rainfall, some pavements are overrun with weeds. People have tripped on them and gone to hospital. In an era of climate crisis and its unpredictable consequences, green politicians may struggle to set the right balance between the social and the natural.\n  The new Green emphasis on equality is also proving divisive, inside the party. For at least three years, the English and Welsh Greens (the Scottish Greens are a separate party) have been split over trans rights. Last month the current leader, Si\u00e2n Berry, decided not to stand for re-election because she believed the party\u2019s pro-trans policy was not being consistently supported by her colleagues. The issue is featuring prominently in the ongoing contest to choose her successor.\\nThe conflicts between generations and values that have made British politics so acrimonious now run through the Green party. They won\u2019t be resolved simply by electing a new leadership. The German Green party, often held up as an example of where the British Green parties should be heading, has seen periods of electoral success and participation in national governments offset by internal battles and defections, over issues from pacifism to family values. Despite Germany\u2019s system of proportional representation, which has given the Greens the parliamentary representation they deserve, their share of the vote in national elections seems to be stuck, at just under 9%. In 2017, it was only half a percentage point higher than 30 years earlier.\\nIn Britain, as elsewhere, all the main parties may adopt significantly greener policies as the climate crisis worsens. That would clearly be a good thing, but would also make it harder for the Greens to differentiate themselves. The party needs to demonstrate its distinctiveness by achievements in office, and by more assertively pointing out when other parties\u2019 environmentalism is just talk.\\nUnless the Greens consistently threaten to take a lot of votes from the main parties, progress towards truly green government will probably be slow, if it happens at all. And as Extinction Rebellion\u2019s hourglass logo unsubtly suggests, the time for an effective green politics, whether it happens in the Green party or somewhere else, is getting short.\\nAndy Beckett is a Guardian columnist", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3234f48896f8c3cf36072c66f6d9add2186f976/0_0_3047_1829/master/3047.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "210826 thomaspullin opinion web"]], "author": ["Andy Beckett"], "date": "2021-08-27"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/aug/23/green-party-steps-into-unknown-with-latest-leadership-election": {"title": "Green party steps into unknown with latest leadership election", "subtitle": null, "text": "Contest is being described by some as a generational fight for future direction of party in England and Wales\\nSome senior party members describe it as a step into the unknown. Others call it a generational fight for its future direction, albeit a politely-fought one. What is clear is that in a few weeks the Greens in England and Wales will be under entirely new management.\\nThe leadership battle, only a year since the last contest, has come after the incumbent duo of Si\u00e2n Berry and Jonathan Bartley both decided to step down, after three years in the role for Berry and five for Bartley, initially as co-leader alongside Caroline Lucas.\\nBidding to fill the vacancy are three candidacy duos and two individuals, a large field assisted by a party constitution that requires signatures from just 20 other members for people to stand.\\nThe internal consensus is that barring a significant shock, the race is between Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay, longtime activists and parliamentary candidates, and Amelia Womack and Tamsin Omond, the current deputy leader and a co-founder of Extinction Rebellion.\\nThe former pair are seen by supporters as arguably the safer choice in a period when the England and Wales Greens are involved in 16 council coalitions and run Brighton and Hove, while its sister party in Scotland is about to enter national government for the first time after a historic deal with the SNP.\\nThe pair have won the backing of Lucas, the Greens\u2019 sole MP, while Denyer is seen as a possible bet to follow Lucas into parliament in the Bristol West seat. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way in the last few years, and Carla and Adrian will help keep us on track,\u201d one backer said.\\nIn contrast, Womack and Omond\u2019s candidacy is viewed as geared more towards the priorities of younger, more recent members, notably the most robust action possible over countering the climate emergency.\\nIf Womack is seen as, in the words of one supporter, \u201cthe safe pair of hands\u201d, Omond\u2019s longtime activism on areas such as climate and airport expansion is appealing to members who have also come via groups such as Extinction Rebellion.\\nA supporter of Womack and Omond said the pair arguably better represented the modern Greens: \u201cA lot of our members now have only been in the party for two or three years, and Tamsin in particular reflects how they arrived.\u201d\\nWhile the distinction is arguably over-simplified \u2013 Womack has been deputy leader for seven years, while Denyer, like many Greens, also has a history of direct activism \u2013 supporters on both sides agree that the choice could end up being significant as the party builds on healthy local election results, a solid national poll standing and growing public awareness of climate issues.\\nAdded into the mix are internal party rows over trans issues and the party\u2019s structures. This led to Berry\u2019s resignation in frustration at the promotion to the frontbench of Shahrar Ali, a former deputy leader who is now standing for the leadership as a self-styled champion of female members who believe the trans debate has become polarised and excluding.\\nWhile some accuse Ali of exploiting the row to boost his candidacy, Womack and Omond are viewed as the candidates aligned most closely with the other side of the debate. Omond identifies as trans and non-binary, using the pronoun they \u2013 allowing the pair to stand, given party rules that state co-leaders must be \u201cof different genders\u201d.\\nEven if the particular disagreement can be resolved or put to one side, Berry\u2019s resignation was as much about her powerlessness over Ali\u2019s promotion.\\nSpokespeople roles are decided by the Greens\u2019 executive committee, also elected by members, and in which the leader or co-leaders are just one voice among, currently, 17 people.\\nThe Greens in England and Wales only started having a leader in 2008, and while those in the party value its member-led and sometimes freewheeling organisational structures, some argue reform is needed.\\n\u201cWe basically have a structure designed for a party with fewer than 10,000 members, and we now have more than 50,000,\u201d one activist said. \u201cIt does maybe need looking at.\u201d\\nAs well as Denyer and Ramsay, Womack and Omond, and Ali, the other candidates standing are Martin Hemingway and Tina Rothery, longstanding environmental activists based in the north of England, and Ashley Gunstock, an actor who formerly appeared in The Bill and took on Lucas in the first ever leadership election in 2008.\\nIt is clear that whoever wins, the Greens will be led by someone who is, in national political terms, a complete unknown.\\nHowever, one activist said this wasn\u2019t entirely new ground: \u201cWe do sometimes make the mistake of thinking that our internal celebrities have some weight outside the party, but they really don\u2019t.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s only really Caroline who has ever broken through.

A new work by artist Baff Akoto tells a different story \u2013 and shows how the civil unrest implicates us all\\nThe video opens on a scene of hazy, unspecified danger. A group of people are milling about on a street corner that could be anywhere, their identities obscured by hoods, caps and the graininess of the footage. It is almost midnight, and the road appears deserted. Suddenly the anonymous figures surge towards the railings on the edge of the pavement and hurl objects at a passing police vehicle, which races away off screen. Initially, there is no sound: just the remote gaze of the CCTV camera. Then as if from the other side of the glass, voices cut through.\\n\u201cMiddle England people \u2013 the older generation at the time \u2013 they didn\u2019t care,\u201d says one. \u201cThey took it as: \u2018Oh yeah, all these people from all these areas are scumbags.\u2019\u201d The words are occasionally drowned out by the noise of helicopters whirring above or police horses clumping below, yet the speakers persist. \u201cWhen you have an elastic band, when you stretch it out to its extreme, it snaps back,\u201d explains another. \u201cThe more you try to break a person, the more they build up resistance.\u201d\\nThe question of who gets to narrate the events of August 2011 \u2013 that handful of hot and broken summer nights when something seemed to crack inside England\u2019s biggest cities, and images of smashed shop fronts, raging fires and faceless youths filled the news \u2013 is one that runs through the heart of UP:RISE, a new work by the artist and film-maker Baff Akoto exploring the memory and legacy of what became known as the riots of 2011, a decade after they occurred. Involving an estimated 20,000 people in locations from Bristol to Birkenhead, and leading to half a billion pounds of damage and nearly 4,000 arrests, clashes between protesters and police \u2013 triggered initially by the latter\u2019s killing of Mark Duggan in Tottenham, north London \u2013 eventually escalated into the biggest wave of urban unrest seen in the UK since the 1980s. The last time disturbances on this scale hit the capital on successive nights was during the anti-Catholic Gordon riots of 1780.\\nGiven how profoundly the 2011 riots shook public consciousness at the time \u2013 generating five days of wall-to-wall television coverage and mounting establishment panic that prompted the government to consider sending military forces on to the streets of mainland Britain \u2013 it\u2019s perhaps surprising how thoroughly absent they are from contemporary political discourse. Once the clips of burning buses and boarded-up high streets faded away, so too did a wider conversation about what lay behind the extensive disorder, and what it might reveal about the iniquities, exclusions and violence of \u201corder\u201d itself. \u201cIt is criminality, pure and simple,\u201d declared prime minister David Cameron at the height of the turmoil. That framing, echoed by fellow politicians and large swathes of the media, was useful for anybody hoping to contain August 2011 within a safe and recognisable template: one in which a bad, mad, felonious underclass engages in a limited bout of feverish troublemaking before law is restored and life mercifully returns to normal.\\nBut the riots could never really be sealed off and dismissed so easily: they were too entangled with complex dynamics stretching far back into Britain\u2019s past, too bound up with fundamental questions of economic and social justice that continue to animate the country today. Those five days have cast a long shadow over the lives of many. Not just the recipients of custodial sentences \u2013 including the individuals quoted above, who were interviewed as part of Akoto\u2019s UP:RISE project \u2013 but also the thousands of young people subsequently placed on the Metropolitan Police\u2019s \u201cGangs Matrix\u201d: a highly racialised database of suspected gang members drawn up in response to the riots that potentially blighted the prospect of anyone whose name was listed, and which has been condemned by Amnesty International as \u201cunfit for purpose\u201d.\\nFor Akoto, though, the ramifications of the riots go much further \u2013 and implicate us all. \u201cThese events are too old to be news, and too new to be history,\u201d he says. \u201cAt least until now. This 10-year anniversary feels like a good moment to start revisiting and recontextualising what happened, and when you do that, you realise so many of the things that define our world now have their roots in what happened then. When you think about it, August 2011 is really the formative moment of 21st-century Britain.\u201d\\nAll riots are alarm bells. This one sounded against the backdrop of a fresh-faced coalition government seeking to build a new political settlement out of the rubble of the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 one that rested on a vast inflation in wealth for those with existing assets such as homes and stock market investments, alongside a real-term cut in the value of wages and a decimation of the state\u2019s social spending budget. The warning was never heeded. In the decade that followed, the fortunes of the UK\u2019s richest 1,000 families more than doubled. Young people, meanwhile, are now on course to end up poorer than their predecessors at every single stage of their adult lives.\\nAkoto, who was abroad at the time, remembers the strange sensation of being stuck in front of a far-flung TV screen watching London, his hometown, burn. \u201cThe context was austerity, evictions, \u2018I agree with Nick [Clegg]\u2019, and the rise of zero-hours contracts and in-work poverty,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was such a powerful sense of hopelessness. Young people were watching their futures disappear before their eyes.\u201d In 2011, that despair and the desire to fight for something different was not confined to Britain: by the summer, revolutionary uprisings had erupted across the Middle East and anti-austerity protests were roiling southern Europe, while the Occupy movement \u2013 which would go on to become a fixture in nearly a thousand cities worldwide \u2013 was in its nascent stages. \u201cIf you looked around, law enforcement was being given the run-around all over the globe,\u201d Akoto recalls. \u201cTo many, that felt hopeful. It was a moment of relief.\u201d\\nMuch of the kindling beneath the riots may have been international in nature, but in England the spark was a very local incident: Duggan, a 29-year-old father of six, was shot by police on Ferry Lane in Tottenham, a mile away from the Broadwater Farm estate on which he lived. He was under investigation by the Met\u2019s Operation Trident unit, which focuses on gun crime in the black community, and had been trailed after picking up a weapon in nearby Leyton. After Duggan\u2019s minicab was stopped, he emerged from the vehicle and was shot twice by officers, dying of his wounds soon afterwards. The police did not inform Duggan\u2019s family of his killing for a day and a half, and the Independent Police Complaints Commission initially suggested that Duggan had opened fire first, before later clarifying that he had not fired any shots. The gun, which was recovered from a patch of grass several metres away from the minicab, wrapped in a sock, displayed no forensic evidence of Duggan having touched it, and the account of the officers involved \u2013 who claimed that Duggan was holding the weapon in his hand as he emerged on to the pavement \u2013 has been fiercely contested, not least in an extensive report produced last year by Forensic Architecture, a research group that specialises in investigating acts of state violence.\\nIn much of the press, Duggan was caricatured as a vicious thug; in Tottenham, one of the poorest areas of London and a neighbourhood with a long history of aggressive policing, news of his killing landed differently. \u201cIt was hotting up all that summer,\u201d recalls Hesketh Benoit, an educator and community worker who runs basketball programmes for local youths. \u201cThe cuts had started, stop-and-search was raising temperatures, and you could feel the tension was going to break.\u201d One of Benoit\u2019s former students, Roger Sylvester, is among several black residents of Haringey \u2013 the borough in which Tottenham is situated \u2013 to have met their death during recent decades while in contact with the police. Another, Cynthia Jarrett, died during a police raid on her home on Broadwater Farm back in 1985; then, as on 6 August 2011, protesters marched from the estate to the police station on Tottenham High Road to demand answers, leading to a standoff and eventual confrontation on the streets. \u201cI\u2019m not tarring every officer with the same brush, but at a certain level the police are a law unto themselves,\u201d Benoit says. \u201cTheir mindset is: \u2018You can\u2019t touch us, we control things.\u2019 And the community in Tottenham sees that, it feels the heaviness.\u201d\\nMany other communities felt some measure of that heaviness too, and as disturbances spread \u2013 first from Tottenham to neighbouring Wood Green and Enfield, then to other parts of the capital as well as Manchester, Liverpool and other major cities \u2013 it became commonplace among media pundits to talk of \u201ccontagion\u201d, as if a disease were circulating among the lowest ranks of society, infecting people with a capacity for mindless carnage. The historian David Starkey\u2019s infamous comments on the BBC\u2019s Newsnight, in which he claimed the \u201cproblem\u201d was that \u201cthe whites have become black\u201d and that \u201ca particular sort of violent, destructive, nihilistic gangster culture has become the fashion\u201d were widely condemned. But dominant narratives surrounding the riots, even when they acknowledged the existence of underlying structural grievances, still flattened an extraordinarily complex process \u2013 inflected by different local contexts and circumstances \u2013 into something sweeping and simplistic that made little room for the agency of rioters themselves.\\n\u201cAsking people to talk to us on their own terms about August 2011 was something that hadn\u2019t necessarily been done before, at least not in the art-historical context,\u201d says Akoto, who made his name with Football Fables, a 2010 documentary feature about the struggle of a young Ghanaian footballer to achieve European stardom. Much of his work since then has involved the exploration of new technologies and their potential role in artistic film-making, and UP:RISE is no exception: you won\u2019t find the exhibition in any gallery, but rather on your mobile phone in the form of augmented reality sculptures, accessed via QR codes installed at a number of sites across England that became focal points for the riots. \u201cThe artist\u2019s studio is somewhere you shouldn\u2019t always be on solid ground,\u201d he explains. \u201cThis project was very much about reimagining what an art exhibition could be; the whole country becomes the gallery.\u201d Accompanying UP:RISE is a programme of public events responding to the project\u2019s themes, ranging from workshops to podcast takeovers.\\nOn the screen, Akoto\u2019s sculptures take the form of menacing apparitions floating in mid-air: an eerie fusion of digital artifice and the built environment, each one comprising a mixture of archive footage from the unrest and first-person testimony from participants. Mobile communication, of course, was central to the riots themselves: there were widespread calls at the time to shut down the BlackBerry Messenger service, and posts on social media \u2013 still in its relative infancy back then \u2013 were later used as evidence during a blizzard of prosecutions (one 22-year-old was sentenced to four years in jail for using Facebook to \u201cincite\u201d riots in his hometown of Warrington \u2013 despite no rioting breaking out there as a result). \u201cDigital technologies are enveloping our entire lives, binding us all together as well as polarising us, and the seeds for that were all there in 2011,\u201d Akoto says. \u201cIt\u2019s the first uprising of the digital era.\u201d\\nAmong those Akoto interviewed for UP:RISE was Aston Walker, a Birmingham-based film-maker turned software engineer who served a four-month jail sentence for looting clothes from H&M during the riots; he was 40 years old at the time, with no previous convictions. \u201cWhen I came out of prison and the media got in touch looking for interviews, no one thought to ask, \u2018Who are you, Aston?\u2019\u201d he told me. \u201cNo one was interested. Representation, and public perception, are very interesting; Baff and his team have put their shoulders to that wheel and gone right in there.\u201d Walker describes the shock he experienced on learning of what he calls \u201cthe extrajudicial execution of Mark Duggan by Her Majesty\u2019s Constabulary\u201d, but also identifies an \u201call-pervading atmosphere\u201d of anger and frustration at the time regarding the way working-class communities \u2013 particularly non-white ones \u2013 were being demonised by the country\u2019s elites, themselves responsible for financial chicanery in the City of London, or mass death and destruction in foreign wars. \u201cThe rot starts at the top,\u201d he says. \u201cBurglary from a commercial premises is opportunistic, and part of that opportunity \u2013 in a delusional way, maybe \u2013 was to get one up on them. It was a wakeup call.\u201d\\nUnlike London, where rioting tended to take place in local neighbourhoods, clashes in Birmingham largely converged on the city centre, where a colossal regeneration project dominated by chain retail outlets has reshaped the urban landscape \u2013 even as dozens of youth centres have been shuttered, and millions of pounds stripped out of the council\u2019s youth services budget. As the academics Basia Spalek, Arshad Isakjee and Thom Davies noted a year later, a significant dimension of the disturbances there involved a struggle over place and belonging, in which spaces designed primarily for those with high economic or cultural capital were fleetingly seized by those without it, creating a mood of celebration and abandon. \u201cAbove the bark of police dogs, and behind the masked and hooded faces of the throng, were smiles, laughter and shrieks of joy,\u201d they wrote. \u201cTo put it plainly, people were doing things in a public space which were not planned.\u201d\\nIn other affected areas around the country, including the Birmingham suburb of Winson Green, where three young men died after being hit by a car while trying to protect local businesses, longstanding tensions between different sections of the community helped to shape the riots\u2019 trajectory. A common thread across all the sites where rioting took place was a sense of collective, if ephemeral, empowerment \u2013 as if for once the poles of authority and fear had been reversed. \u201cThey really don\u2019t love us, do they,\u201d says one young woman whose voice appears in UP:RISE. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s why I went. I think I went because I know they don\u2019t love us. So why do I care?\u201d\\nThe very language of \u201criots\u201d is contested; many of those whom I spoke to for this story consider it a term of pride that taps into Britain\u2019s rich history of civil unrest, synonymous in the postwar era with famous rebellions in places such as Toxteth and Brixton. Akoto believes that its appropriateness depends on the context. \u201cIn the mainstream it\u2019s a word that is often used lazily, and therefore becomes a reductive shorthand,\u201d he argues. \u201cWhat it\u2019s shorthand for \u2013 that\u2019s the interesting thing, and that\u2019s part of what UP:RISE is trying to address.\u201d At a time when debate over how we commemorate and celebrate history in public spaces is particularly fierce \u2013 driven in part by a government keen to distract from many of the same economic faultlines that divided the country back in 2011 \u2013 Akoto\u2019s work could be interpreted as a provocative intervention in the so-called \u201cculture wars\u201d, but he\u2019s keen to resist that framing. \u201cYou hope there\u2019s something timeless about a piece of art,\u201d he says. \u201cThe great challenge is to make something that can withstand the incessant waves of topicality, and when all is said and done still matter in some way.\u201d\\nPart of the timelessness in this case may lie in the fact that, far from disappearing, in many parts of the UK the conditions that helped produce the events of August 2011 \u2013 from tensions over policing, to economic exclusion \u2013 have intensified. \u201cThe grassroots black community of Tottenham is even more marginalised, isolated and lacking in representation today than it was 10 years ago,\u201d says Stafford Scott, co-founder of the campaigning organisation Tottenham Rights, and one of the curators behind War Inna Babylon, an exhibition currently open at London\u2019s ICA that shines a light on several decades of collective action among Britain\u2019s black communities. Hesketh Benoit, the Haringey-based basketball coach who works in partnership with the local authority, told me that only recently one of his younger colleagues was swooped on by police as he left the courts and walked to his car; he was subsequently released without charge. \u201cI thought we weren\u2019t going to get him back,\u201d Benoit said. \u201cI can feel the pressure building yet again.\u201d As Zak Philips, a 21-year-old from Birmingham\u2019s Asian community who recently graduated from university, puts it: \u201cIn 2011 there was inequality, lack of jobs and unaffordable housing. We\u2019ve got all that to deal with, plus a global pandemic.\u201d\\nBut today\u2019s young people have something else as well: an increasingly bold, assertive and networked protest culture, visible in the Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion mobilisations that have proliferated across Britain in recent years. In UP:RISE, Akoto traces a line from these actions directly back to August 2011, contending that it was in the heat of the riots that contemporary patterns of revolt were forged. Whether one accepts that claim or not, it\u2019s vital that communal memories of those all too fragile moments \u2013 ones in which existing patterns of privilege and control get disrupted \u2013 are preserved and renewed for each generation, because the state has every interest in tidying them away into obscurity. Less than a year after the riots, Cameron declared that the London Olympics had \u201cbrought the whole nation together\u201d. In the aftermath of Duggan\u2019s shooting, the IPCC concluded that there was \u201cno evidence to indicate criminality\u201d on the part of the police and an inquest recorded a verdict of lawful killing; in the past half century, only two officers have ever been convicted in the UK in relation to deaths after contact with police. Meanwhile Boris Johnson has promised an expansion of stop-and-search powers and the government\u2019s new Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts bill threatens to effectively outlaw any future protests that cause \u201cserious annoyance\u201d to others, exposing organisers to jail sentences of up to 10 years. \u201cThere ain\u2019t no justice,\u201d Scott says. \u201cThere\u2019s just us.\u201d\\nIn 1985, widespread unrest in the Birmingham neighbourhood of Handsworth helped lay the groundwork for Tottenham\u2019s own disturbances a few weeks later; in 2011, inspiration flowed the other way. \u201cThere are no stories in the riots, only the ghosts of other stories,\u201d declares an unseen narrator in Handsworth Songs, John Akomfrah\u2019s award-winning film about those earlier events. When I ask Akoto, who counts Akomfrah among his mentors, whether we are likely to see more riots on the streets of Britain, he puts it another way. \u201cI think you know the answer to that question,\u201d he smiles. \u201cThe antagonistic state and social dynamics that produce these kinds of uprisings don\u2019t go away, they only morph into something new. It\u2019s all different volumes from the same epic.\u201d\\nThis article was amended on 11 August 2021 to clarify in the headline and some parts of the text that the 2011 riots occurred in England, not across the UK.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac60d5802164503b295e6e1309094d607f9d5916/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "UK Riots - review Design"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fbfcbbb7974b0de244d56817afb684c79716967/0_286_5443_3266/master/5443.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Residents watch as a building burns after riots on Tottenham High Road on 7 August 2011."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceecb45892efde956c5124d2bf0d966e75058890/0_164_5191_3116/master/5191.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Baff Akoto for Guardian Review"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d40e8c67bdc3dd4f538f273ed10d18c9ab9e645/0_80_2622_1573/master/2622.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Looters in central Birmingham, 9 August 2011."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef7f9ea9769ce5e3cec77d4736b97a2ab1ab4ddb/0_118_3467_2081/master/3467.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Tarmiq Jahan, father of Haroon Jahan, gives a statement near where Haroon and two other men were hit by a car and killed in Birmingham on 10 August 2011."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c36f713dff134d4707aea24cd81d9de4d3240a82/0_98_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "A protester holds a sign with Mark Duggan\u2019s name on it to mark the 2020 anniversary of the riots."]], "author": ["Jack Shenker"], "date": "2021-08-06"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/21/wrong-to-label-extinction-rebellion-as-extremists-says-home-office-adviser": {"title": "Wrong to label Extinction Rebellion as extremists, says Home Office adviser", "subtitle": null, "text": "Peer at odds with Priti Patel over climate activists on eve of more protests\\nA government extremism adviser has admitted during a private meeting that it is wrong to label Extinction Rebellion (XR) supporters as \u201cextreme\u201d, despite the home secretary, Priti Patel, condemning the group as \u201ccriminals\u201d who threaten the nation\u2019s way of life.\\nJohn Woodcock, the former Labour MP who was asked by the Home Office this year to examine disruption and violence by extreme political groups, sought to reassure XR activists that he did not regard the movement as uniformly extreme during a Zoom video conference call last month. \u201cYou\u2019re worried that I want to label everyone who supports XR as extremists and that is certainly not the case,\u201d he said.\\nWoodcock, who now sits in the upper chamber as Lord Walney, also accepted he needed to know more about climate science and agreed there was a need for urgent action to address the climate crisis.\\n\u201cI have become increasingly convinced of the need to act further and faster than we have,\u201d he said. \u201cI supported the Labour party\u2019s position of declaring a climate emergency [in parliament] but what comes from that is not clear in my mind.\u201d\\nWoodcock\u2019s reassurance comes on the eve of XR\u2019s latest campaign of non-violent civil disobedience, which is targeting the City of London, in order to end fossil fuel investment. The protests are expected to be some of the most significant yet, with growing numbers of people terrified by the findings of the latest climate report from the world\u2019s leading authority on climate science, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and increasingly extreme weather events.\\nFears are mounting in the XR movement that activists will be raided by the police, spurred on by Patel\u2019s open hostility to the group\u2019s tactics. Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan police commissioner, has described the group\u2019s plans as \u201cextremely frustrating\u201d and asserted that Londoners do not support \u201chugely disruptive protests\u201d.\\nWoodcock \u2013 who was appointed as the government\u2019s independent adviser on political violence and disruption in November \u2013 made his comments on the call, which has been seen by the Observer, after impassioned pleas by a diverse range of XR supporters.\\nAmelia Halls, 23, who is part of XR\u2019s social media team, told the peer that young supporters feared the consequences of being branded extreme. \u201cWe protest because we know without significant and meaningful action \u2026 we won\u2019t have a future,\u201d she said. \u201cBy opening up this inquiry into extremism and by naming Extinction Rebellion, what this inquiry is doing is ensuring that thousands of young people across the UK as individuals will be considered extremists and this will ruin their lives.\u201d\\nRobin Red, who is part of an XR samba band, said black activists were worried they would be targeted by the police if Extinction Rebellion was classed as extreme. \u201cAs a person of colour, you don\u2019t want to get nicked \u2013 your life changes in two minutes \u2026 you can\u2019t get a decent job and housing is affected,\u201d Red said. \u201cBeing an activist is dangerous enough as it is \u2013 to conflate Extinction Rebellion with an extremist organisation basically puts a mark on my back.\u201d\\nRabbi Jeffrey Newman, who is part of XR Jews, told the peer that limiting protest rights was dangerous. \u201cWe are in no way extreme, but we express our democratic rights as enshrined in the social contract between government and people, and imperilling these rights threatens us,\u201d he said.\\nHowever, Woodcock left open the possibility he might describe parts of the group as extreme in his report. He asked if XR was hiding a \u201cfar-left\u201d anti-capitalist agenda and claimed there were concerns that far-left groups might be infiltrating the movement.\\nWoodcock, who will present his recommendations to Patel and Boris Johnson, claimed the group might end up abandoning democracy itself. \u201cYou can change the form of democracy, make it more participatory, but ultimately the public are not going to accept \u2026 the level of economic reduction, which you believe is necessary, and therefore \u2026 you will end up in an alternative to democracy itself,\u201d he said.\\nDr Gail Bradbrook, a co-founder of XR who chaired the meeting, stressed the group wanted more democracy not less, with citizen assembles guiding climate policy. She added she was worried Woodcock\u2019s inquiry was politically motivated and had been set up to silence XR. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that you\u2019ve already made your mind up about us,\u201d she said.\\nShami Chakrabarti, the former shadow attorney general, said it was dangerous to equate dissent with disloyalty and non-violent protest with terrorism. \u201cIt begins with a sloppy lack of legal definition and soon critics of government policy are branded as enemies of the state.

But it was recently the backdrop, in the search for greener flying, to a strange and remarkable scene.\\n\u201cAnyone passing would have wondered why these people were staring at a pipe and whooping and laughing,\u201d says Bobby Sethi, associate professor of gas turbine combustion at Cranfield University. \u201cBut we were almost certainly the only people in the world right then burning anything without producing CO2.\u201d\\nIn the painstaking groundwork of testing whether hydrogen could replace kerosene as a fuel for global aviation, Sethi and team were celebrating a breakthrough.\\n\u201cWe were able to demonstrate successful ignition and safe combustion of pure hydrogen and air at high temperature and pressure \u2013 producing no carbon emissions,\u201d he says. Even if, he adds, the passing layperson would have only seen a pipe and some steam.\\nLike a Harold Ramis character in Ghostbusters, Sethi had long been labouring on experiments in an unfashionable, almost-derided field \u2013 before society decided that it was indeed spooked, in this case by jet fumes frying the planet. Who you gonna call? Cranfield\u2019s centre for propulsion engineering.\\nSethi recalls the scepticism of even five years ago, when he was pursuing funding for the hydrogen research project, known as Enable H2: \u201cThey said we were eccentrics. Now they\u2019re queueing up to be on our advisory board.\u201d\\nThere are broadly three strands of work that the aviation industry is frantically investigating for an environmentally acceptable future. One is to create greener fuels for the large aircraft currently in service. A second is electric flight, which appears feasible for smaller aircraft and short-haul hops. And a third is hydrogen.\\nTwo projects pioneered at Cranfield are using hydrogen in the form of fuel cells to power electric motors and propel planes: ZeroAvia flew a six-seater from here last September, and hopes to scale up the technology for commercial short-haul flights in the coming decades. Another, Project Fresson, is planning to use fuel cells for a green, short-hop passenger service around the Orkney islands as soon as 2023.\\nBut the ambitions for direct combustion of hydrogen are on a bigger scale; whether a radically different plane and propulsion system could replace the modern, kerosene-fuelled passenger jet. Which is where Sethi\u2019s research comes in.\\nNothing yet in the sheds looks anything like a plane. The rig here is a unique facility, Sethi says, assembled to show that hydrogen can be clean, safe and efficient for aviation, and produce data showing the optimum temperature and pressure to minimise other harmful emissions such as nitrogen oxides or NOx, a family of highly poisonous gases.\\nThe largest component is a pebble-bed heater pressure vessel, which delivers super-hot air at pressure into a combustion chamber, where the hydrogen is mixed in and ignited. Stacked outside are crates of lasers, ready to be unpacked, to help observe \u201cthe shape of the flame\u201d and provide more data.\\nThe combination of lasers and combustible hydrogen, he admits, sounds like a health and safety nightmare (an adjacent control room has a giant red stop button to flood the system with nitrogen). But the experiments here will prove, he believes, that hydrogen is no more difficult or risky to reignite at altitude than kerosene.\\n\u201cTechnically there\u2019s nothing non-feasible in hydrogen \u2013 though there\u2019s research and development to be done. The main issue with hydrogen is the cost.\u201d\\nThat will change, he believes, as fossil fuels become environmentally and politically untenable and taxes, subsidy and demand alter. He thinks hydrogen will become a part of aviation \u201csomewhere between 2040 and 2050, depending on the subsidies and political pressure\u201d.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s pressure from green lobbyists, people like Extinction Rebellion, which has made hydrogen come to the front again,\u201d he adds.\\nThe step change in interest in sustainable aviation has re-energised research at Cranfield. Tim Mackley, head of the university\u2019s Aerospace Integration Research Centre, says: \u201cWe were always interested in efficiency \u2013 but in the last two or three years there\u2019s been a large push to saying what the manufacturers were planning wasn\u2019t really enough.\u201d\\nSustainable aviation fuels, or Safs, could make some inroads into reducing carbon emissions, and last month the government announced early development funding for eight UK-based projects, which propose to build plants to convert the likes of household waste, carbon from the atmosphere and sewage into jet fuel at commercial scales.\\nSafs can only be an intermediate measure, Mackley says. \u201cThey are sustainable in terms of their production \u2013 but they still burn producing CO2.\u201d But such \u201cdrop-in fuels\u201d, which can be added to the mix with current technology still have a valid role now, he argues \u2013 not least given the enormous carbon impact of replacing an entire global fleet of aircraft with new types of planes.\\nFor short-haul hops, those could include something like the strange craft that sits centre stage, if very much behind closed doors, in Mackley\u2019s part of Cranfield. This is an experimental eVTOL \u2013 an electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, a development project in conjunction with Rolls-Royce. Although partial footage of the plane caused some excitement among enthusiasts when leaked on the internet last year, the full picture reveals an issue: it moves by being strapped on to a large truck.\\n\u201cThis was never meant to fly,\u201d says Mackley. Instead, what the model is designed to test is how the rotors react at the difficult moment when turning between vertical liftoff and forward thrust \u2013 and, being too big to put in a wind tunnel, the plane is affixed to a hulking ex-German fire truck and driven down Cranfield\u2019s runway. \u201cIt was the only thing with the acceleration to get to 80 mph and the power to carry the aircraft.\u201d\\nCranfield is one of many players working on eVTOLS, usually in isolation, leading to some very individual designs. Sometimes, on the big reveal, Mackley admits: \u201cAbsolutely, I do think what the hell is that.\u201d\\nBut, he says: \u201cTo make the best of electric we have to be inventive about how that looks.\u201d\\nWhether hydrogen or electric, planes will evolve \u2013 and flight may well be slower than before, he says. As well as the environment, designers will always need to bear in mind how their planes will work for passengers, he warns: \u201cIf you don\u2019t build the concept that airlines like, then it won\u2019t succeed.\u201d\\nThis article was amended on 25 August 2021.
