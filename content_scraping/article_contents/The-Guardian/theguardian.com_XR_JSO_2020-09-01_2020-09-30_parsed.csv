For the first time since the protests began, XR was high up the news agenda and once again the subject of heated public debate. The nature and target of the protests drew stinging criticism, with the prime minister and home secretary Priti Patel accusing XR of undermining democracy and a free press, and branding the group “criminals” and a threat to the British way of life. In anonymous briefings the government even floated the idea of classing XR as an “organised crime group”.', 'And it was not just the Conservative party who criticised the action. Labour leader Keir Starmer said the blockade was “an attack on the cornerstone of democracy” and the newspapers themselves, as well as media commentators and the Society of Editors, have since lined up to denounce the group.', 'But for XR – and many in the wider environment movement – the action was deemed legitimate and necessary. They argued that much of the rightwing press, owned by a handful of billionaires, have played a key role in downplaying the climate crisis and undermining the structural changes needed to address it – that much of our press, in fact, is far from free.', 'Angus Satow, co-founder of the leftwing grassroots environmental group Labour for a Green New Deal, told the Guardian: “We desperately need groups like XR to highlight the political and economic actors that are driving this climate crisis.

I hope when things have settled down this will lead to real progress in the quality of the reporting.”', 'A criticism of XR ahead of its latest rebellion, especially from black and ethnic minority groups, was that its tactic of encouraging mass arrests ignored the reality of police racism, and effectively made the protests the preserve of privileged white people.', 'The September protests aimed to be different, with XR working more closely with other groups and recognising the connections between structural racism, inequality and the climate crisis.', 'Daze Aghaji, who has been involved with XR since the beginning of last year, said the last two weeks had been the most diverse rebellion so far.', '“There is still loads of work to do on this but we are learning … we are having good conversations with other groups, listening and making sure we are much better at making sure everyone knows they are welcomed.”', 'Black environmental activists outside of XR say the movement was making some progress but urged the media to highlight the work of other grassroots groups who are focusing on climate and racial justice.', 'As XR wound up its latest rebellion on Thursday, it was already preparing its next campaign.

Its actions over the past two weeks did not capture the public imagination in the way it had done in April last year. By attacking the rightwing media, they have made a formidable enemy – and according to some critics, may have distracted the press and the public from their core message about the climate crisis.', 'But as evidence of the climate and ecological emergency mounts – from melting glaciers in the Antarctic to wildfires in California and the widespread destruction of wildlife and the natural world – XR still believes it has a crucial role to play.', 'As Boris Johnson stood up in parliament for PMQs on Wednesday, 92-year-old Arnold Pease, from Manchester, was being arrested outside for his part in the protests.', 'As he was being led away by police, Pease said: “We’re here to continue holding them to account.

Seeing Boris Johnson ritually dismembered in parliament might make us feel better, but nothing changes. He still has an 80-seat majority, though less than 30% of the electorate voted for the Conservatives. We are reduced, for five long years, to spectators.', 'Our system allows the victorious government a mandate to do what it likes between elections, without further reference to the people. As we have seen, this can include breaking international law, suspending parliament, curtailing the judiciary, politicising the civil service, attacking the Electoral Commission and invoking royal prerogative powers to make policy without anyone’s consent. This is not democracy, but a parody of democracy.', 'By contrast to our five-yearly vote, capital can respond to government policy every second, withdrawing its consent with catastrophic consequences if it doesn’t like its drift. There’s a massive imbalance of power here. The voting power of capital, with modern trading technologies, has advanced by leaps and bounds. Electoral power is trapped in the age of the quill pen.', 'The problem, in other words, is not just Johnson. The problem is the UK’s political system, which presents an open invitation for autocratic behaviour. In the past, people warned that a ruthless operator could make hay with this system. Well, that moment has come.', 'Labour has long been part of the problem, refusing to contemplate even a change to our preposterous first-past-the-post elections, let alone any wider surrender of power. And it is tragic to watch it now, still playing by the old rules. These state that a party should not show its hand until a few months before the election. That’s four years away, and the power grab is happening now. We urgently need a stirring alternative vision, a call to democratic arms. Instead, we get forensic dissections of particular government policies: admirably done, but unmatched to the moment.', 'At moments like this, old parties flounder. New ideas arise outside the system, and effective opposition takes place on the street. Of course, this is difficult now, as there are good public health reasons not to gather in large numbers, and we can expect the government to exploit them. But civil disobedience is ever-inventive, constantly developing new tactics in response to attempts to shut it down.', 'We saw some of these in Extinction Rebellion’s latest week of protests, and we saw something else too: its emergence as a broad oppositional movement, taking on the billionaire press, the lobbyists, the banks and other bastions of power, that are not usually associated with the extinction and climate crises, but are fundamental to them. From the beginning, XR has been both an environmental movement and a democracy movement: participatory politics, in the form of citizens’ assemblies, has been one of its key demands.', 'Like the suffragettes and the civil rights movement, it was excoriated for threatening “our way of life”. Almost all democratic advances, everywhere, have been secured by people who were branded “anarchists” and “criminals”.', 'The democratic and environmental crises have the same roots: our exclusion, for several years at a time, from meaningful politics. In some places, particularly Ireland, Iceland, France, Taiwan, British Columbia, Ontario and several Spanish and Brazilian cities, a host of fascinating experiments with new democratic forms has been taking place: constitutional conventions, citizens’ assemblies, community development, digital deliberation and participatory budgeting. They are designed to give people a voice between elections, tempering representative democracy, allowing them to refine their choices.', 'The UK pays lip service to these innovations. Last week the citizens’ assembly on climate, convened by parliament, published its findings, which included suggestions such as taxing frequent fliers, getting rid of SUVs and eating less red meat. But there are no obvious means by which they can be adopted by the government. In Scotland, all local authorities allow residents to set part of their budgets, though so far, it’s very small: just 1% of the money allocated by central government.', 'Unless the results of participatory democracy can be translated into policy, and unless it operates at a meaningful scale, it generates cynicism and disillusion. But as the processes in Ireland, Madrid and in some Brazilian cities have shown, when people are allowed to make big and frequent decisions, the results can be transformative. Alienated, polarised populations come together to identify and solve their common problems. Democracy becomes a lived reality.', 'Nowhere has participatory politics yet been allowed to fulfil its promise. There is no principled or technical reason why the majority of a municipal or national budget should not be set through public deliberation, following techniques pioneered in the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre. There is no principled or technical reason why the monthly voting process for improving life in Reykjavik could not be applied at the national level, everywhere. The call for full-scale participatory democracy is as revolutionary as the call for the universal franchise was in the 19th century. What is needed is a vehicle similar in scale to the Chartist and suffragette movements.', 'There are precedents for environmental protests mutating into democratic revolutions: this is what helped precipitate the collapse of the Soviet Union. Our climate and extinction crises expose the failures of all quasi-democratic systems, and the blatant capture of ours by the power of money turns the UK into a global crucible.', 'In XR’s outrageous, reviled protests we see the beginnings of what could become a 21st-century democratic revolution. Through his incompetence, callousness and greed for power, Johnson has done us two favours: exposing the shallowness of our theatrical democracy, and creating a potential coalition ranging from hospital porters to supreme court judges.

In all three scenarios the report found that the use of oil in transport would reach a peak in the mid- to late 2020s due to the shift towards electric cars and hydrogen-powered vehicles.', 'Another factor dragging on the forecasts for oil demand in the coming decades are new measures to limit the production of plastic, which is manufactured using petrochemicals produced from fossil fuels, through more recycling and less single-use plastics.', 'The effect may be an upending of global energy market dynamics, according to BP. The report expects members of the Opec oil cartel, led by Saudi Arabia, to bear the brunt of the decline in demand while US shale rigs take a greater share of the global oil market over the next decade.

Now they’re campaigning against racism, climate breakdown and equality', 'In June, Simukai Chigudu stepped up on a plinth in front of thousands of people blocking the streets outside Oriel College in Oxford. The associate professor of African politics addressed the crowds inspired by Black Lives Matter and the anti-racism protests sweeping across the UK and around the world, catalysed by the killing of yet another black man at the hands of police in the US.', 'Chigudu told the crowds that, yes, he was angry – how could he not be? He is one of just an estimated seven black professors employed by the University of Oxford, an institution that has faced years of questioning over diversity and its treatment of students and staff of colour.', 'As a postgraduate student five years ago, he was one of the founding members of Rhodes Must Fall in Oxford, a major student-led protest arguing for the decolonisation of Oxford and calling for the removal of the statue of Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes, which stands outside Oriel College.', 'In early June, the world watched as protesters in Bristol knocked down the statue of slave trader Edward Colston. The energy spread to Oxford, sparking a resurgence of the campaign to bring down Rhodes.', '“When I stood up to speak and I was surveying the crowd, I could see the different eyes being cast on me. I saw a lot of people who didn’t have much to do with the university. It felt like there was this convergence of people, that an anti-racism project has to be far-reaching,” he says.', 'Yet five years prior, the Rhodes Must Fall in Oxford campaign had felt like a movement that would never spread past the city’s limestone walls. The activists who launched a campaign to decolonise the university’s curriculum and challenge its racist iconography, inspired by the University of Cape Town’s original Rhodes Must Fall campaign, were continuously challenged on their views.', 'Yet the pervasiveness of racism at the university was made startlingly apparent when, not long after the campaign began, the bar at an Oxford Union debate on the British Empire sold a cocktail named the “colonial comeback”, accompanied by images of black hands in chains.', 'After a leaked document in January 2016 warned the college would lose about £100m in donor gifts if Rhodes did fall, the movement lost momentum.', 'Yet though under the same name, this summer’s protest felt different. There was a realisation, Chigudu says, that “it felt like a city having a reckoning, rather than a closed matter for the university”.', 'This summer’s tsunami of activism has added weight to the role of students in protests and campaigns that go beyond the campus. Malaika Gangooly is starting her second year of journalism at City University of London, another institution that recently bowed to student pressure to remove the name of John Cass – the 18th-century merchant linked to the slave trade – from its business school.', 'She led the Black Lives Matter protests in her hometown of Chingford, and now plans to run for diversity officer at the students’ union. “People thought I was maybe too young to start in protests, and too heavily involved. But the younger you are, the better it is to get involved, and the more important it is. If it’s not worked in generations before us, then we’re the generation that has to try and make it work.”', 'These same arguments have been reproduced in the youth climate movement in the past two years. The urgency of the disaster has been pushed by young people, many of whom are university students. Their campus activism has led to radical divestment from fossil fuel campaigns, while students have played major roles in local branches of Extinction Rebellion or the youth climate strikes. In 2018, for example, two students at Sussex University were claimants on a significant climate change lawsuit against the UK government.', '“So much of the change that’s happening now is people my age at university. If we take it into our own hands then no one can complain about it,” says Gangooly.', 'Something in the atmosphere has changed. For Gangooly’s generation, it’s obvious that issues affecting students are mirrored in society: it is young people who will bear the brunt of the climate catastrophe; there is institutional racism at the universities that breed our future leaders.', '“[Recently] there’s been the circulation of many more ideas about how we might change society and how we deal with questions of equality, but also what that means in terms of a world in which there’s so much economic insecurity, in which there’s a looming climate catastrophe, and so on,” says Chigudu. “That’s partly contributed to the willingness of people to really rally around and protest, and for people to see the interconnections between racism, capitalism and climate catastrophe.”', 'This idea of students questioning their future on a mass scale echoes back to post-financial crisis Britain. In November, it will be a decade since tens of thousands of students occupied streets across the UK, protesting a steep rise in university fees and cuts to the Education Maintenance Allowance. Britain’s press was overrun with images of students occupying Millbank, clashes with police and placards repeating the slogan “No Future”.', 'It was one of the biggest mass movements of young people in British history, and “the first of a series of major mass movements to characterise the next five years, not just in Britain but around the world,” says Matthew Myers, a graduate student of History at the University of Oxford, pointing to movements such as Occupy and the Arab Spring that followed.', 'Though often discussed as a campaign against fee hikes, the student protests of 2010 addressed issues of austerity and inequality. “It was a very specific moment in time where young people were at the forefront. There was a sense of generational injustice,” says Myers, who participated in the 2010 protests and is the author of Student Revolt.', '“A whole generation in 2010 were very motivated by slogans of ‘no future’. They felt the future that they’d been promised – if they worked hard, got a good job, then they’d be able to achieve the level of economic stability and success which their parents had been promised – was no longer possible,” says Myers. “Students were simply the first in a long line of groups who were going to have to pay for the crisis, and pay for austerity.”', 'A decade on, it seems students are once again realising they will pay for other injustices, and they are now asking what their role is to make changes – particularly with race, climate and inequality.', 'But this resurgence of student activism will reverberate far beyond their own lives. “[It has] almost become more profound,” says Myers. “The student climate strikers are speaking as much as students as they are as human beings who are going to have to live on a planet which is entering climate catastrophe.”']",['Naomi Larsson Piñeda'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5ffce7ada9a9919e968ff66e41f2fd3c6c09040/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', '‘It felt like a city having a reckoning, rather than a closed matter for the university.’']]",

It is being marketed as a retrospective, a look back at his life and 60-years-plus career. But make no mistake about its true agenda: Attenborough is here to deliver a stark warning that time is ticking for the planet. It is a personal film – and political, too. There is emotion and urgency in that familiar soothing voice.

It must reduce rival centres of power – the judiciary, the civil service, academia, broadcasters, local government, civil society – to satellites of its own authority, controlled from the centre, deprived of independent action. But it must do this while claiming to act in the people’s name.', 'So it needs an apparatus of justification: arguments that can be fed through a sympathetic press and manufactured into outrage against its rivals. This is where the intellectual work of such a government is focused.', 'In the UK, Dominic Cummings is not the sole architect of this project: much of the intellectual landscaping has been outsourced. Since the 1950s, an infrastructure of persuasion has been built, whose purpose is to supplant civic power with the power of money. The model was developed by two fanatical disciples of Friedrich Hayek, the father of neoliberalism: Antony Fisher and Oliver Smedley. They knew it was essential to disguise their intentions. While founding the Institute of Economic Affairs, the first of the thinktanks whose purpose was to spread Hayek’s gospel, Smedley reminded Fisher it was “imperative that we should give no indication in our literature that we are working to educate the Public along certain lines … That is why the first draft [of our aims] is written in rather cagey terms.”', 'The institute, and the other lobby groups Fisher founded, honed the arguments that would be used to strip down the state, curtail public welfare and public protection, and restrict and undermine other forms of social cohesion, releasing the ultra-rich from the constraints of democracy. Unsurprisingly, some of the richest people on Earth poured cash into his project.', 'His groups translated Hayek’s ideas, seen by many as repulsive, into a new political common sense – producing the reframings and justifications on which Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan built their revolutions.', 'Others began to copy this model. Madsen Pirie, the founder of the Adam Smith Institute, describes in his autobiography how, using funds from 20 of the UK’s biggest companies, he helped to chart the course that Thatcher took. Every Saturday, while she was in opposition, staff from the Adam Smith Institute and the Institute of Economic Affairs sat down for lunch with Conservative party researchers, and leader writers and columnists from the Times and Telegraph, to plot out her rise to power. They “planned strategy for the week ahead”, and would “co-ordinate our activities to make us more effective collectively”. Pirie describes how he devised many of the policies that defined Thatcherism.', 'And elsewhere too, not least in the testimony of the Brexit campaign whistleblower Shahmir Sanni, there is evidence that these lobby groups coordinate their work, creating the impression that people in different places are spontaneously coming to the same conclusions. Several of them work from the same offices, in 55 and 57 Tufton Street, Westminster.', 'The lobby group that Boris Johnson’s government uses most is Policy Exchange. While it claims to be a neutral educational charity, it was founded in 2002 by the Conservative MPs Francis Maude and Archie Norman, and Nick Boles, who later also became a Tory MP. Its first chairman was Michael Gove. Its proposals and personnel have been adopted by the Conservative party ever since.', 'Policy Exchange has played an important role in shifting power away from rival institutions and into the prime minister’s office. For several years it has been building a case for curtailing the judiciary. It provided the ammunition for the government’s current attack on judicial review, which enables citizens to sue the government to uphold the law. This was the process transparency campaigner Gina Miller used: in 2016 to oblige Theresa May to seek parliamentary approval for triggering the Brexit process; and, last year, to overturn Boris Johnson’s suspension of parliament.', 'Policy Exchange calls such rulings “judicial overreach”. It claims they threaten the sovereignty of parliament and the separation of powers between government and judiciary. To my mind they do the opposite. The law is not whatever Boris Johnson says it is: it is legislation passed by parliament and interpreted by the courts. Both the Miller cases returned powers to parliament that prime ministers had seized. The government has now appointed a former Conservative minister, Lord Faulks, to examine judicial review, along the lines suggested by Policy Exchange.', 'This lobby group has called for the prime minister’s office to have greater powers “to develop and direct policy change” through the civil service, and to appoint leaders of public bodies whose “culture and values” align with government’s aims. It has led the public attacks on what it calls the “chilling effects” of leftwing views in academia. Its recent report on academic freedom was brilliantly eviscerated in the Guardian by Jonathan Portes, who found it riddled with basic statistical errors and mistaken assumptions. What purports to be a campaign for intellectual freedom looks more like a McCarthyite attempt to suppress left-leaning ideas. It’s an effective weapon in the government’s gathering culture war.', 'Policy Exchange’s proposals for changing the planning system, which involve a massive removal of power from local authorities, have been adopted wholesale by the government. One of the authors of this scheme, Jack Airey, has moved from the thinktank to Downing Street, as a special adviser.', 'Last year, Policy Exchange published a polemic that claimed Extinction Rebellion is led by dangerous extremists. As usual, it was widely covered by the media. Less discussed was the report that the lobby group has received funding from the power company Drax, the trade association Energy UK, and the gas companies E.ON and Cadent, whose fossil-fuel investments are threatened by environmental activism. These are among the few funders whose identities we know. Policy Exchange is listed by Who Funds You? as among the UK’s most opaque thinktanks. It might seem remarkable that without having to reveal its funders, while promoting shifts that could harm civil society, Policy Exchange remains a registered charity.', 'Conservative governments clearly attach great importance to the way charities are overseen. In 2018, a parliamentary committee sent the government an unprecedented letter, pointing out that the government’s preferred candidate as chair of the Charity Commission, the former Tory minister Baroness Stowell, was “unable to demonstrate … any real insight, knowledge or vision”; could not be seen as neutral; and had failed to withstand the committee’s scrutiny. The government appointed her anyway, and she remains chair today.', 'By such means, political life is steadily undermined, until little remains but authority and obedience to the prime minister. Without strong civic institutions, society loses its power. From the point of view of global capital, that’s mission accomplished.

What might have seemed a relatively dry idea on paper – a trawl through 200-year-old art – turned out to be thumpingly relevant to almost every aspect of modern life, even down to last week’s Extinction Rebellion protests and migrant landings.', 'Because what the Romantics did was nothing less than change our way of thinking about the world. For good and, sometimes, for ill. Blake, Shelley, Delacroix, Wollstonecraft, Chopin and the rest of the gang, Schama argued with cogency, persuasion and some great phrasemaking, gave us little less than the very ideas of democracy, of national belonging (something of a double-edged sword), of obsession with the self, even interest in nature… and “we still think with their mind, we feel with their emotional heartbeat”.', 'Think you’re the first creative type to dare to put politics into your wilfully controversial art? Delacroix and Géricault got there way first, the latter with his astonishing Raft of the Medusa. Think cancel culture is an achingly millennial movement? Try the Terror, which spread through Mary Wollstonecraft’s adopted Paris in the years after the Revolution when segments of the left, after a handsome and brave new dawn, began to ensure that thinking the wrong thoughts would not merely get you censored but torched out of (or often inside) your own home. Getting righteous and huffy in middle England at the insidious distribution of inflammatory ideas? Again, nothing on Britain’s aristos in the early 1800s, who closed the free press and outlawed atheism. Schama, without ever being too heavy- handed, drew all these and many more parallels directly back to the Romantic squad’s passionate drive to convert the old religions of veneration and obedience to the new ones of insurrection and agitation.', 'Seldom was this more in evidence in the modern age than France (again) in 1968, students and workers together on barricades. One of Schama’s strengths as a presenter – and good on the broadcaster for resisting the blandishments of a myriad younger and arguably sexier historians – is that he can actually say he was in the streets of Paris during that long fraught hopeful summer (working, I believe, on his first book), and thus has an earned right to tell us all about it.', 'Crucially, Schama never talks down, or attempts to sugar the pill by presenting a complex argument as anything other. Your brain has to keep up. This is a great series, sadly only three parts. Plus, we get intriguing art lessons along the way – and great readings by Christopher Eccleston, Harriet Walter and hip-hop artist Testament.', 'If good moment of the week was Louis Theroux video-chatting to twins, first encountered 16 years ago, who have grown into lovely understanding human beings, bad moment of the week was the same terribly young twins being encouraged by their mother, that very long time ago, to form, in essence, a Nazi pop group. Smiley-faced Hitler emojis on the T-shirts, abhorrently racist lyrics. Even in hindsight – Life on the Edge is essentially a back catalogue of greatest hits, interspersed with reflections from an older, bearded, wiser Louis Theroux – this was a grim and nasty watch.', 'One might argue that Theroux has, throughout his career, with his mix of charm and his inviting, pregnant, come-hither silences, cleverly mixed interviewees of the near-credible type with those of the (frankly) mentally ill type. Nevertheless, he has told wider truths, from the wilder fringes of humanity and the extremes of belief – often toxic, or merely of the fruit-loopy conspiracist mindset (JFK: it was suicide) – and thus expanded our conversations. The twins’ mother, April, he did not blame: she was “incapable of seeing anything through a non-racial lens”. Can any among us feel anything else, now, except pity?', 'Theroux’s fascination is and always has been the exploitation of the vulnerable, and the fact even the most absurd charlatan can inspire real results. But Theroux is inextricably drawn to charlatans, and long may that continue.', 'I have read and heard some mild criticism regarding Sue Perkins being given the big two-nighter documentary Along the US-Mexico Border, seeking some truths about the wall, the border and immigration. Why not a grownup journalist?', 'I’ll tell you exactly why. Perkins is by far the most apt person for the job. She overflows with both natural wit and empathy, and is often braver than she looks. Plus, one aspect of bravery is being unafraid of nuance, of grey areas, open to the concept that one might hold two ideas in one’s head at the same time.', 'There was little doubt where her loyalties lay: the impassioned plea for fairness towards the end of the second episode showed that Perkins is nothing less than a true romantic. But she was demonstrably capable of showing the same understanding (and warm humour, reciprocated in kind) towards a good-ole-boy Texan rancher overrun nightly by migrants, as she would show to the dirt-poor, and the fleeing, themselves. A news reporter might have let slip far more righteous Trump-contempt; Perkins was sparing with her snark, and thus the programme was greater for letting us make up our own minds. A truly enlightening couple of nights.', 'Not sure whether Leicester’s having a good year of it. It was at a nightclub there where one of the Chocolate Men – a troupe of 12 black strippers, who have, in co-founder Louis’s words, “to be good dancers and have a penis length of more than eight inches” – got carried away on his debut dance. In what must have been the most eggshell-fraught phrase uttered in voiceover this year, “Django allows a woman to briefly engage in oral sex with him”.', 'So many questions, which the makers of The Black Full Monty, Channel 4’s documentary about Britain’s first all-black male strip group, duly, if but occasionally, asked.', '“Some might say what you’re doing is perpetuating stereotypes?” “Are you selling sex, or are you selling race?” Louis and co-promoter Dante gamely tried to bat them back: “You can never satisfy everyone… anything you do as a black guy is going to be hard… it’s a stepping-stone, people are earning money, living good, what about that?” But I’m not sure we ever got an answer that would satisfy, say, the head of race and gender studies at Oxbridge Polyversity.', 'Perhaps, because there are so many questions about this, we should (as the makers tended to in the end) just see it a little bit of good dirty fun.

We are stratospheres above that now and TfL will be saddled paying for this, even in our uncertain future.”', 'Russell also accused the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, of trying to hide the full cost of the scheme.', '“Last year he told us the Silvertown road tunnel would cost £1bn, but now we finally see what TfL will actually pay and it’s heading for £2bn. This is outrageous.”', 'Transport for London said the existing cost of building the tunnel – around £1bn – had not increased. It said the additional costs covered in the £2bn figure included “ongoing operational costs … for 25 years as well as any maintenance and asset renewal required”.', 'There has been growing opposition to the project from local residents and green campaigners who say it would be environmentally destructive and undermine efforts to clean up the capital’s polluted air. They also argue it “fatally undermines” efforts to build a green recovery from the coronavirus – with dire consequences for some of London’s most vulnerable citizens.', 'Last week the shadow minister for climate change and local MP, Matthew Pennycook, added his voice, calling on Khan to abandon the scheme, saying “green transport must be the future of our city”.', 'If it goes ahead, the tunnel would be funded with a loan to be repaid by introducing tolls on the Blackwall and Silvertown tunnels.', 'The TfL accounts state the authority would repay £65m a year – index linked – between 2025 and 2050. At 1.6% [the current retail price index], that would lead to a total payment of about £2bn by 2050.', 'A Transport for London (TfL) spokesperson did not dispute the overall figure of £2bn but said the cost of building the Silvertown Tunnel – around £1bn – had not increased.', 'In a statement they added: “All payments towards the Silvertown tunnel will be funded from a road user charge, which will cover both the Blackwall and Silvertown Tunnel and will only begin once it is available for use, with payments linked to the performance of the contractor on key criteria such as availability.', '“These charges will not only repay the construction costs, but will also cover the ongoing operational costs for the tunnel for 25 years as well as any maintenance and asset renewal required.”', 'A spokesperson for the mayor said Khan “ has been clear that he doesn’t want to replace one health crisis with another, and he is determined that our city’s recovery from coronavirus will be clean, green and sustainable”.', 'The spokesperson said a new tunnel at Silvertown was crucial because the existing infrastructure was “antiquated and worn out”.', '“The tunnel will provide a public transport-focused river crossing with improved bus links across the Thames. The combination of introducing tolls on both the Blackwall tunnel and at Silvertown – and the extension of the ultra low emission zone from 2021 so that Silvertown will be within the area covered – will play a crucial role in tackling congestion and improving air quality.”', 'Steve Chambers, an independent transport consultant and academic at London South Bank University, said the £2bn price tag meant the scheme was an “expensive debt” for TfL to service.', '“The financial risks of the scheme are becoming clearer and there is no guarantee that the debt can be serviced from tolls alone.

Like millions of other little children all over the world with posters of Paddy Ashdown above their beds, you had a dream: to one day lead our boys in yellow. But unlike them, your dream came true.', 'Now, you’ll have noticed that people are very angry at the moment, about all kinds of different things: the coronavirus pandemic, Brexit, racism, climate breakdown, the economy, the Tories, the Labour party. And we want all of those people to vote for your friends and mine, the Lib Dems, at the next general election. So what we need is a statement that implies we’re like, good, but in the most general possible way. OK, hold on, now I think you might love this. What about: “I am listening”? It’s good, isn’t it? Hoof the ball right back into the public’s court. Great stuff. OK, here’s two free drink tokens – enjoy the party, champ.', 'I’m being a little unfair to Ed Davey here, and in any case, dunking on the Lib Dems is so easy it’s almost distasteful. His speech on winning the leadership contest last week was only the latest in a long line of politicians’ statements promising that their biggest priority was to listen to the electorate. William Hague made needing to listen the centrepiece of his 1998 party conference speech, and Tony Blair did the same at his party conference in 2000.', 'Listening has felt especially ubiquitous this year. Rory Stewart’s vampiric London mayoral campaign involved asking people to invite him across their thresholds for a chat and a sleepover, an idea that, in the era of social distancing, seems about as contemporary as a sprightly quadrille. Taking listening-as-home-invasion into the pandemic age, Keir Starmer has spent the summer doing Zoom-based listening tours of the country. And in the US a few weeks ago, Joe Biden assured young voters that he would “hear their voices”, too.', 'It’s not just politicians either. In the wake of George Floyd’s death, brands and institutions rushed to social media to confirm that they too were listening. Sweaty Betty is listening. The University of Hull is listening. PG Tips, with an upturned teacup pressed against your bedroom wall, is listening.', 'Why all this emphasis on listening? More often than not, it’s little more than an easy thing to say when you don’t want to alienate voters – or customers – by falling down hard on one side of an issue. Listening does form a central part of what MPs do locally in their constituencies through their regular surgeries, a term which makes the process sound about as appealing as getting your knee reset by Michael Fabricant.', 'Talking about listening to an entire population, however, is all too often an empty platitude or performance. And no wonder politicians don’t want to actually listen to public grievances when so much of what they would hear is unfiltered rage. Boris Johnson’s “People’s PMQs” stunt has seen him receive questions from the public such as “When will you resign for your mishandling of the pandemic?” and the ever-popular “How do you sleep at night?”', 'Political listening is always, in the end, a selective process. Listening to whom? Whomever’s opinion already aligns best with the party’s values? Both Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour and Nigel Farage’s Brexit party claimed to be about listening to people. And in any case, not all concerns are created equal. Tinfoil milliners concerned about whether China is beaming coronavirus into their homes via cellular data waves, or your local crank who wants to make it punishable by law not to thank the bus driver are, I would argue, less worthy of airtime than people concerned about the impacts of systemic racism.', 'A popular belief of the political centre in the UK is that the act of listening in and of itself can somehow bring wildly diverging opinion on contentious issues to an imagined point of agreement or compromise. Extinction Rebellion has attracted criticism for its emphasis on setting up a citizens’ assembly  to discuss what should be done to tackle the climate crisis. It’s a noble enough idea, but as they often emphasise, time is running out. We don’t need more conversation, we need widespread divestment from fossil fuels. When brands promise they are listening on Black Lives Matter, it implies that what is required is more testimony rather than more action. And Starmer’s inexhaustible appetite for holding inquiries is a slightly different but related urge – sure, we can take action on things, but only after we spend a great deal of time yakking about it.', 'In Leah Bassel’s book The Politics of Listening, she writes: “Politics means naming the social forces that deflect attention from particular voices, and is necessarily adversarial as well as active and creative.” It is never going to be enough just to listen; one has to take action against the forces that mean certain voices are unheard in the first place.

Will YOU comply?!” (“Yes, Jeremy,” I sigh.) “Do you know how the government is going to shrink your takeaway pizzas?!” (“No, Jeremy.”) “Should all hotels allow dogs?!” (“I don’t know, Jeremy, I’m just trying to write an article, how do I minimise you.”)', 'The actual show is basically an Old Man Yells At Cloud Olympics, where members of the public compete to see who can call in and complain about millennials the loudest. The Human Paperclip is always joined by two panelists: one a Daily Mail/Express columnist who squawks out stock phrases like “fishing rights” and “rule Britannia” like a xenophobic parrot, and the other a tired liberal who just wants to go back to 2015. Clippy presents one of the day’s stories to his panellists in as friendly a manner as he can (“It looks like you’re trying to start a culture war.

Each one has a plot that resonates with Channel 5’s core values (“stay indoors, trust no-one, everyone is trying to kill you”), and while they all feel like they could have been written by American rightwing shock-jock Bill O’Reilly after an all-night bender, The Killer Choice takes Best Screenplay for Totally Batshit Plot.', 'A war veteran EMT has to choose between saving a pregnant woman or a dying man during a convenience-store robbery. She chooses the pregnant woman, but 10 years later the wife of the man who died has become the boss of the EMT’s husband with the sole intention of hiring a hitman to kill the husband and her daughter in front of the EMT. This is just the first 20 minutes – I haven’t even got to the bit where the wife of the dead man feeds his ashes to a Venus flytrap while whispering: “It won’t be long now, John.” It is exhilaratingly bad, but I would happily watch it again and again.

And, you know, there is a strange comfort in that.']",['Jack Bernhardt'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ea7c5ce730bada2a707b6292d9b0528165fc55c/0_21_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'Blood'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef0242627413a9a30ecb27f593ce683cd4be4a63/0_193_5787_3472/master/5787.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Nicholas Ralph in All Creatures Great and Small.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dada6f33e9225f9c07ad75a54b6dc641b8ea7ce/0_74_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Ambulance Code Red.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d0e731949dcbcc7ac40943dd789e558522ad8dd/119_0_3563_2138/master/3563.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Snake'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f156a550bf86ed1b60f5d65d8ca4c3c339f96785/4_0_3563_2138/master/3563.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Elephant'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5aeecd148c40976eec992a71af62bd31d51221d/12_0_750_450/master/750.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Can’t Pay We’ll Take It Away.']]",

This is the case even if the material itself is not extreme, as the use of it could imply endorsement or support of the organisation.”', 'It listed examples of what were described as “extreme political stances”, such as “a publicly stated desire to abolish or overthrow democracy, capitalism, or to end free and fair elections”; opposition to freedom of speech; the use of racist, including antisemitic, language; the endorsement of illegal activity; and a failure to condemn illegal activities done in support of their cause.', 'McDonnell said: “On this basis it will be illegal to refer to large tracts of British history and politics including the history of British socialism, the Labour Party and trade unionism, all of which have at different times advocated the abolition of capitalism.', '“This is another step in the culture war and this drift towards extreme Conservative authoritarianism is gaining pace and should worry anyone who believes that democracy requires freedom of speech and an educated populace.”', 'Economist and former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis said the guidance showed “how easy it is to lose a country, to slip surreptitiously into totalitarianism”.', 'He added: “Imagine an educational system that banned schools from enlisting into their curricula teaching resources dedicated to the writings of British writers like William Morris, Iris Murdoch, Thomas Paine even. Well, you don’t have to. Boris Johnson’s government has just instructed schools to do exactly that.”', 'Barrister Jessica Simor QC suggested that the government has on occasion not complied with the guidance itself, after it admitted the new Brexit bill would break international law (“endorsement of illegal activity”) and continued selling arms to Saudi Arabia for use in Yemen following a court ruling that it was unlawful.', 'Do the fourth and fifth bullet points mean that schools should not accept Government money? https://t.co/5hllx55iZN', 'Tariq Ali, the writer and activist, said although the new guidance was a sign of “moral and political bankruptcy”, the advent of the internet meant such measures were futile.', '“Leaving aside the stupidity, these things don’t work,” he said. “People will read what they want to read. Trying to enhance a version of the Prevent strategy, which is already in place, is quite scandalous and shocking.', '“If you put things on a banned list, lots of young people can access them via the internet and read them. Banning them from schools will not work at all, aside from the fact it’s a sign of moral and political bankruptcy.”', 'He added: “How could both young and old people not read anti-capitalist analysis after 2008, or now with the virus going on and recessions looming all over the western world.”', 'It is understood that the DfE is clear that schools should not work with agencies that take extreme positions, including promoting non-democratic political systems, and that teachers should be politically impartial.', 'Minister for school standards Nick Gibb said: “Our new relationships, sex and health education (RHSE) guidance and training resources equip all schools to provide comprehensive teaching in these areas in an age-appropriate way.', '“These materials should give schools the confidence to construct a curriculum that reflects diversity of views and backgrounds, whilst fostering all pupils’ respect for others, understanding of healthy relationships, and ability to look after their own wellbeing.”', 'It comes after counter-terrorism police earlier this year placed the non-violent group Extinction Rebellion on a list of extremist ideologies that should be reported to the authorities running the Prevent programme.
