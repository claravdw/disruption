For the first time since the protests began, XR was high up the news agenda and once again the subject of heated public debate. The nature and target of the protests drew stinging criticism, with the prime minister and home secretary Priti Patel accusing XR of undermining democracy and a free press, and branding the group “criminals” and a threat to the British way of life. In anonymous briefings the government even floated the idea of classing XR as an “organised crime group”.', 'And it was not just the Conservative party who criticised the action. Labour leader Keir Starmer said the blockade was “an attack on the cornerstone of democracy” and the newspapers themselves, as well as media commentators and the Society of Editors, have since lined up to denounce the group.', 'But for XR – and many in the wider environment movement – the action was deemed legitimate and necessary. They argued that much of the rightwing press, owned by a handful of billionaires, have played a key role in downplaying the climate crisis and undermining the structural changes needed to address it – that much of our press, in fact, is far from free.', 'Angus Satow, co-founder of the leftwing grassroots environmental group Labour for a Green New Deal, told the Guardian: “We desperately need groups like XR to highlight the political and economic actors that are driving this climate crisis.

I hope when things have settled down this will lead to real progress in the quality of the reporting.”', 'A criticism of XR ahead of its latest rebellion, especially from black and ethnic minority groups, was that its tactic of encouraging mass arrests ignored the reality of police racism, and effectively made the protests the preserve of privileged white people.', 'The September protests aimed to be different, with XR working more closely with other groups and recognising the connections between structural racism, inequality and the climate crisis.', 'Daze Aghaji, who has been involved with XR since the beginning of last year, said the last two weeks had been the most diverse rebellion so far.', '“There is still loads of work to do on this but we are learning … we are having good conversations with other groups, listening and making sure we are much better at making sure everyone knows they are welcomed.”', 'Black environmental activists outside of XR say the movement was making some progress but urged the media to highlight the work of other grassroots groups who are focusing on climate and racial justice.', 'As XR wound up its latest rebellion on Thursday, it was already preparing its next campaign.

Its actions over the past two weeks did not capture the public imagination in the way it had done in April last year. By attacking the rightwing media, they have made a formidable enemy – and according to some critics, may have distracted the press and the public from their core message about the climate crisis.', 'But as evidence of the climate and ecological emergency mounts – from melting glaciers in the Antarctic to wildfires in California and the widespread destruction of wildlife and the natural world – XR still believes it has a crucial role to play.', 'As Boris Johnson stood up in parliament for PMQs on Wednesday, 92-year-old Arnold Pease, from Manchester, was being arrested outside for his part in the protests.', 'As he was being led away by police, Pease said: “We’re here to continue holding them to account.

Seeing Boris Johnson ritually dismembered in parliament might make us feel better, but nothing changes. He still has an 80-seat majority, though less than 30% of the electorate voted for the Conservatives. We are reduced, for five long years, to spectators.', 'Our system allows the victorious government a mandate to do what it likes between elections, without further reference to the people. As we have seen, this can include breaking international law, suspending parliament, curtailing the judiciary, politicising the civil service, attacking the Electoral Commission and invoking royal prerogative powers to make policy without anyone’s consent. This is not democracy, but a parody of democracy.', 'By contrast to our five-yearly vote, capital can respond to government policy every second, withdrawing its consent with catastrophic consequences if it doesn’t like its drift. There’s a massive imbalance of power here. The voting power of capital, with modern trading technologies, has advanced by leaps and bounds. Electoral power is trapped in the age of the quill pen.', 'The problem, in other words, is not just Johnson. The problem is the UK’s political system, which presents an open invitation for autocratic behaviour. In the past, people warned that a ruthless operator could make hay with this system. Well, that moment has come.', 'Labour has long been part of the problem, refusing to contemplate even a change to our preposterous first-past-the-post elections, let alone any wider surrender of power. And it is tragic to watch it now, still playing by the old rules. These state that a party should not show its hand until a few months before the election. That’s four years away, and the power grab is happening now. We urgently need a stirring alternative vision, a call to democratic arms. Instead, we get forensic dissections of particular government policies: admirably done, but unmatched to the moment.', 'At moments like this, old parties flounder. New ideas arise outside the system, and effective opposition takes place on the street. Of course, this is difficult now, as there are good public health reasons not to gather in large numbers, and we can expect the government to exploit them. But civil disobedience is ever-inventive, constantly developing new tactics in response to attempts to shut it down.', 'We saw some of these in Extinction Rebellion’s latest week of protests, and we saw something else too: its emergence as a broad oppositional movement, taking on the billionaire press, the lobbyists, the banks and other bastions of power, that are not usually associated with the extinction and climate crises, but are fundamental to them. From the beginning, XR has been both an environmental movement and a democracy movement: participatory politics, in the form of citizens’ assemblies, has been one of its key demands.', 'Like the suffragettes and the civil rights movement, it was excoriated for threatening “our way of life”. Almost all democratic advances, everywhere, have been secured by people who were branded “anarchists” and “criminals”.', 'The democratic and environmental crises have the same roots: our exclusion, for several years at a time, from meaningful politics. In some places, particularly Ireland, Iceland, France, Taiwan, British Columbia, Ontario and several Spanish and Brazilian cities, a host of fascinating experiments with new democratic forms has been taking place: constitutional conventions, citizens’ assemblies, community development, digital deliberation and participatory budgeting. They are designed to give people a voice between elections, tempering representative democracy, allowing them to refine their choices.', 'The UK pays lip service to these innovations. Last week the citizens’ assembly on climate, convened by parliament, published its findings, which included suggestions such as taxing frequent fliers, getting rid of SUVs and eating less red meat. But there are no obvious means by which they can be adopted by the government. In Scotland, all local authorities allow residents to set part of their budgets, though so far, it’s very small: just 1% of the money allocated by central government.', 'Unless the results of participatory democracy can be translated into policy, and unless it operates at a meaningful scale, it generates cynicism and disillusion. But as the processes in Ireland, Madrid and in some Brazilian cities have shown, when people are allowed to make big and frequent decisions, the results can be transformative. Alienated, polarised populations come together to identify and solve their common problems. Democracy becomes a lived reality.', 'Nowhere has participatory politics yet been allowed to fulfil its promise. There is no principled or technical reason why the majority of a municipal or national budget should not be set through public deliberation, following techniques pioneered in the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre. There is no principled or technical reason why the monthly voting process for improving life in Reykjavik could not be applied at the national level, everywhere. The call for full-scale participatory democracy is as revolutionary as the call for the universal franchise was in the 19th century. What is needed is a vehicle similar in scale to the Chartist and suffragette movements.', 'There are precedents for environmental protests mutating into democratic revolutions: this is what helped precipitate the collapse of the Soviet Union. Our climate and extinction crises expose the failures of all quasi-democratic systems, and the blatant capture of ours by the power of money turns the UK into a global crucible.', 'In XR’s outrageous, reviled protests we see the beginnings of what could become a 21st-century democratic revolution. Through his incompetence, callousness and greed for power, Johnson has done us two favours: exposing the shallowness of our theatrical democracy, and creating a potential coalition ranging from hospital porters to supreme court judges.

In all three scenarios the report found that the use of oil in transport would reach a peak in the mid- to late 2020s due to the shift towards electric cars and hydrogen-powered vehicles.', 'Another factor dragging on the forecasts for oil demand in the coming decades are new measures to limit the production of plastic, which is manufactured using petrochemicals produced from fossil fuels, through more recycling and less single-use plastics.', 'The effect may be an upending of global energy market dynamics, according to BP. The report expects members of the Opec oil cartel, led by Saudi Arabia, to bear the brunt of the decline in demand while US shale rigs take a greater share of the global oil market over the next decade.

Now they’re campaigning against racism, climate breakdown and equality', 'In June, Simukai Chigudu stepped up on a plinth in front of thousands of people blocking the streets outside Oriel College in Oxford. The associate professor of African politics addressed the crowds inspired by Black Lives Matter and the anti-racism protests sweeping across the UK and around the world, catalysed by the killing of yet another black man at the hands of police in the US.', 'Chigudu told the crowds that, yes, he was angry – how could he not be? He is one of just an estimated seven black professors employed by the University of Oxford, an institution that has faced years of questioning over diversity and its treatment of students and staff of colour.', 'As a postgraduate student five years ago, he was one of the founding members of Rhodes Must Fall in Oxford, a major student-led protest arguing for the decolonisation of Oxford and calling for the removal of the statue of Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes, which stands outside Oriel College.', 'In early June, the world watched as protesters in Bristol knocked down the statue of slave trader Edward Colston. The energy spread to Oxford, sparking a resurgence of the campaign to bring down Rhodes.', '“When I stood up to speak and I was surveying the crowd, I could see the different eyes being cast on me. I saw a lot of people who didn’t have much to do with the university. It felt like there was this convergence of people, that an anti-racism project has to be far-reaching,” he says.', 'Yet five years prior, the Rhodes Must Fall in Oxford campaign had felt like a movement that would never spread past the city’s limestone walls. The activists who launched a campaign to decolonise the university’s curriculum and challenge its racist iconography, inspired by the University of Cape Town’s original Rhodes Must Fall campaign, were continuously challenged on their views.', 'Yet the pervasiveness of racism at the university was made startlingly apparent when, not long after the campaign began, the bar at an Oxford Union debate on the British Empire sold a cocktail named the “colonial comeback”, accompanied by images of black hands in chains.', 'After a leaked document in January 2016 warned the college would lose about £100m in donor gifts if Rhodes did fall, the movement lost momentum.', 'Yet though under the same name, this summer’s protest felt different. There was a realisation, Chigudu says, that “it felt like a city having a reckoning, rather than a closed matter for the university”.', 'This summer’s tsunami of activism has added weight to the role of students in protests and campaigns that go beyond the campus. Malaika Gangooly is starting her second year of journalism at City University of London, another institution that recently bowed to student pressure to remove the name of John Cass – the 18th-century merchant linked to the slave trade – from its business school.', 'She led the Black Lives Matter protests in her hometown of Chingford, and now plans to run for diversity officer at the students’ union. “People thought I was maybe too young to start in protests, and too heavily involved. But the younger you are, the better it is to get involved, and the more important it is. If it’s not worked in generations before us, then we’re the generation that has to try and make it work.”', 'These same arguments have been reproduced in the youth climate movement in the past two years. The urgency of the disaster has been pushed by young people, many of whom are university students. Their campus activism has led to radical divestment from fossil fuel campaigns, while students have played major roles in local branches of Extinction Rebellion or the youth climate strikes. In 2018, for example, two students at Sussex University were claimants on a significant climate change lawsuit against the UK government.', '“So much of the change that’s happening now is people my age at university. If we take it into our own hands then no one can complain about it,” says Gangooly.', 'Something in the atmosphere has changed. For Gangooly’s generation, it’s obvious that issues affecting students are mirrored in society: it is young people who will bear the brunt of the climate catastrophe; there is institutional racism at the universities that breed our future leaders.', '“[Recently] there’s been the circulation of many more ideas about how we might change society and how we deal with questions of equality, but also what that means in terms of a world in which there’s so much economic insecurity, in which there’s a looming climate catastrophe, and so on,” says Chigudu. “That’s partly contributed to the willingness of people to really rally around and protest, and for people to see the interconnections between racism, capitalism and climate catastrophe.”', 'This idea of students questioning their future on a mass scale echoes back to post-financial crisis Britain. In November, it will be a decade since tens of thousands of students occupied streets across the UK, protesting a steep rise in university fees and cuts to the Education Maintenance Allowance. Britain’s press was overrun with images of students occupying Millbank, clashes with police and placards repeating the slogan “No Future”.', 'It was one of the biggest mass movements of young people in British history, and “the first of a series of major mass movements to characterise the next five years, not just in Britain but around the world,” says Matthew Myers, a graduate student of History at the University of Oxford, pointing to movements such as Occupy and the Arab Spring that followed.', 'Though often discussed as a campaign against fee hikes, the student protests of 2010 addressed issues of austerity and inequality. “It was a very specific moment in time where young people were at the forefront. There was a sense of generational injustice,” says Myers, who participated in the 2010 protests and is the author of Student Revolt.', '“A whole generation in 2010 were very motivated by slogans of ‘no future’. They felt the future that they’d been promised – if they worked hard, got a good job, then they’d be able to achieve the level of economic stability and success which their parents had been promised – was no longer possible,” says Myers. “Students were simply the first in a long line of groups who were going to have to pay for the crisis, and pay for austerity.”', 'A decade on, it seems students are once again realising they will pay for other injustices, and they are now asking what their role is to make changes – particularly with race, climate and inequality.', 'But this resurgence of student activism will reverberate far beyond their own lives. “[It has] almost become more profound,” says Myers. “The student climate strikers are speaking as much as students as they are as human beings who are going to have to live on a planet which is entering climate catastrophe.”']",['Naomi Larsson Piñeda'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5ffce7ada9a9919e968ff66e41f2fd3c6c09040/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', '‘It felt like a city having a reckoning, rather than a closed matter for the university.’']]",

It is being marketed as a retrospective, a look back at his life and 60-years-plus career. But make no mistake about its true agenda: Attenborough is here to deliver a stark warning that time is ticking for the planet. It is a personal film – and political, too. There is emotion and urgency in that familiar soothing voice.

It must reduce rival centres of power – the judiciary, the civil service, academia, broadcasters, local government, civil society – to satellites of its own authority, controlled from the centre, deprived of independent action. But it must do this while claiming to act in the people’s name.', 'So it needs an apparatus of justification: arguments that can be fed through a sympathetic press and manufactured into outrage against its rivals. This is where the intellectual work of such a government is focused.', 'In the UK, Dominic Cummings is not the sole architect of this project: much of the intellectual landscaping has been outsourced. Since the 1950s, an infrastructure of persuasion has been built, whose purpose is to supplant civic power with the power of money. The model was developed by two fanatical disciples of Friedrich Hayek, the father of neoliberalism: Antony Fisher and Oliver Smedley. They knew it was essential to disguise their intentions. While founding the Institute of Economic Affairs, the first of the thinktanks whose purpose was to spread Hayek’s gospel, Smedley reminded Fisher it was “imperative that we should give no indication in our literature that we are working to educate the Public along certain lines … That is why the first draft [of our aims] is written in rather cagey terms.”', 'The institute, and the other lobby groups Fisher founded, honed the arguments that would be used to strip down the state, curtail public welfare and public protection, and restrict and undermine other forms of social cohesion, releasing the ultra-rich from the constraints of democracy. Unsurprisingly, some of the richest people on Earth poured cash into his project.', 'His groups translated Hayek’s ideas, seen by many as repulsive, into a new political common sense – producing the reframings and justifications on which Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan built their revolutions.', 'Others began to copy this model. Madsen Pirie, the founder of the Adam Smith Institute, describes in his autobiography how, using funds from 20 of the UK’s biggest companies, he helped to chart the course that Thatcher took. Every Saturday, while she was in opposition, staff from the Adam Smith Institute and the Institute of Economic Affairs sat down for lunch with Conservative party researchers, and leader writers and columnists from the Times and Telegraph, to plot out her rise to power. They “planned strategy for the week ahead”, and would “co-ordinate our activities to make us more effective collectively”. Pirie describes how he devised many of the policies that defined Thatcherism.', 'And elsewhere too, not least in the testimony of the Brexit campaign whistleblower Shahmir Sanni, there is evidence that these lobby groups coordinate their work, creating the impression that people in different places are spontaneously coming to the same conclusions. Several of them work from the same offices, in 55 and 57 Tufton Street, Westminster.', 'The lobby group that Boris Johnson’s government uses most is Policy Exchange. While it claims to be a neutral educational charity, it was founded in 2002 by the Conservative MPs Francis Maude and Archie Norman, and Nick Boles, who later also became a Tory MP. Its first chairman was Michael Gove. Its proposals and personnel have been adopted by the Conservative party ever since.', 'Policy Exchange has played an important role in shifting power away from rival institutions and into the prime minister’s office. For several years it has been building a case for curtailing the judiciary. It provided the ammunition for the government’s current attack on judicial review, which enables citizens to sue the government to uphold the law. This was the process transparency campaigner Gina Miller used: in 2016 to oblige Theresa May to seek parliamentary approval for triggering the Brexit process; and, last year, to overturn Boris Johnson’s suspension of parliament.', 'Policy Exchange calls such rulings “judicial overreach”. It claims they threaten the sovereignty of parliament and the separation of powers between government and judiciary. To my mind they do the opposite. The law is not whatever Boris Johnson says it is: it is legislation passed by parliament and interpreted by the courts. Both the Miller cases returned powers to parliament that prime ministers had seized. The government has now appointed a former Conservative minister, Lord Faulks, to examine judicial review, along the lines suggested by Policy Exchange.', 'This lobby group has called for the prime minister’s office to have greater powers “to develop and direct policy change” through the civil service, and to appoint leaders of public bodies whose “culture and values” align with government’s aims. It has led the public attacks on what it calls the “chilling effects” of leftwing views in academia. Its recent report on academic freedom was brilliantly eviscerated in the Guardian by Jonathan Portes, who found it riddled with basic statistical errors and mistaken assumptions. What purports to be a campaign for intellectual freedom looks more like a McCarthyite attempt to suppress left-leaning ideas. It’s an effective weapon in the government’s gathering culture war.', 'Policy Exchange’s proposals for changing the planning system, which involve a massive removal of power from local authorities, have been adopted wholesale by the government. One of the authors of this scheme, Jack Airey, has moved from the thinktank to Downing Street, as a special adviser.', 'Last year, Policy Exchange published a polemic that claimed Extinction Rebellion is led by dangerous extremists. As usual, it was widely covered by the media. Less discussed was the report that the lobby group has received funding from the power company Drax, the trade association Energy UK, and the gas companies E.ON and Cadent, whose fossil-fuel investments are threatened by environmental activism. These are among the few funders whose identities we know. Policy Exchange is listed by Who Funds You? as among the UK’s most opaque thinktanks. It might seem remarkable that without having to reveal its funders, while promoting shifts that could harm civil society, Policy Exchange remains a registered charity.', 'Conservative governments clearly attach great importance to the way charities are overseen. In 2018, a parliamentary committee sent the government an unprecedented letter, pointing out that the government’s preferred candidate as chair of the Charity Commission, the former Tory minister Baroness Stowell, was “unable to demonstrate … any real insight, knowledge or vision”; could not be seen as neutral; and had failed to withstand the committee’s scrutiny. The government appointed her anyway, and she remains chair today.', 'By such means, political life is steadily undermined, until little remains but authority and obedience to the prime minister. Without strong civic institutions, society loses its power. From the point of view of global capital, that’s mission accomplished.

What might have seemed a relatively dry idea on paper – a trawl through 200-year-old art – turned out to be thumpingly relevant to almost every aspect of modern life, even down to last week’s Extinction Rebellion protests and migrant landings.', 'Because what the Romantics did was nothing less than change our way of thinking about the world. For good and, sometimes, for ill. Blake, Shelley, Delacroix, Wollstonecraft, Chopin and the rest of the gang, Schama argued with cogency, persuasion and some great phrasemaking, gave us little less than the very ideas of democracy, of national belonging (something of a double-edged sword), of obsession with the self, even interest in nature… and “we still think with their mind, we feel with their emotional heartbeat”.', 'Think you’re the first creative type to dare to put politics into your wilfully controversial art? Delacroix and Géricault got there way first, the latter with his astonishing Raft of the Medusa. Think cancel culture is an achingly millennial movement? Try the Terror, which spread through Mary Wollstonecraft’s adopted Paris in the years after the Revolution when segments of the left, after a handsome and brave new dawn, began to ensure that thinking the wrong thoughts would not merely get you censored but torched out of (or often inside) your own home. Getting righteous and huffy in middle England at the insidious distribution of inflammatory ideas? Again, nothing on Britain’s aristos in the early 1800s, who closed the free press and outlawed atheism. Schama, without ever being too heavy- handed, drew all these and many more parallels directly back to the Romantic squad’s passionate drive to convert the old religions of veneration and obedience to the new ones of insurrection and agitation.', 'Seldom was this more in evidence in the modern age than France (again) in 1968, students and workers together on barricades. One of Schama’s strengths as a presenter – and good on the broadcaster for resisting the blandishments of a myriad younger and arguably sexier historians – is that he can actually say he was in the streets of Paris during that long fraught hopeful summer (working, I believe, on his first book), and thus has an earned right to tell us all about it.', 'Crucially, Schama never talks down, or attempts to sugar the pill by presenting a complex argument as anything other. Your brain has to keep up. This is a great series, sadly only three parts. Plus, we get intriguing art lessons along the way – and great readings by Christopher Eccleston, Harriet Walter and hip-hop artist Testament.', 'If good moment of the week was Louis Theroux video-chatting to twins, first encountered 16 years ago, who have grown into lovely understanding human beings, bad moment of the week was the same terribly young twins being encouraged by their mother, that very long time ago, to form, in essence, a Nazi pop group. Smiley-faced Hitler emojis on the T-shirts, abhorrently racist lyrics. Even in hindsight – Life on the Edge is essentially a back catalogue of greatest hits, interspersed with reflections from an older, bearded, wiser Louis Theroux – this was a grim and nasty watch.', 'One might argue that Theroux has, throughout his career, with his mix of charm and his inviting, pregnant, come-hither silences, cleverly mixed interviewees of the near-credible type with those of the (frankly) mentally ill type. Nevertheless, he has told wider truths, from the wilder fringes of humanity and the extremes of belief – often toxic, or merely of the fruit-loopy conspiracist mindset (JFK: it was suicide) – and thus expanded our conversations. The twins’ mother, April, he did not blame: she was “incapable of seeing anything through a non-racial lens”. Can any among us feel anything else, now, except pity?', 'Theroux’s fascination is and always has been the exploitation of the vulnerable, and the fact even the most absurd charlatan can inspire real results. But Theroux is inextricably drawn to charlatans, and long may that continue.', 'I have read and heard some mild criticism regarding Sue Perkins being given the big two-nighter documentary Along the US-Mexico Border, seeking some truths about the wall, the border and immigration. Why not a grownup journalist?', 'I’ll tell you exactly why. Perkins is by far the most apt person for the job. She overflows with both natural wit and empathy, and is often braver than she looks. Plus, one aspect of bravery is being unafraid of nuance, of grey areas, open to the concept that one might hold two ideas in one’s head at the same time.', 'There was little doubt where her loyalties lay: the impassioned plea for fairness towards the end of the second episode showed that Perkins is nothing less than a true romantic. But she was demonstrably capable of showing the same understanding (and warm humour, reciprocated in kind) towards a good-ole-boy Texan rancher overrun nightly by migrants, as she would show to the dirt-poor, and the fleeing, themselves. A news reporter might have let slip far more righteous Trump-contempt; Perkins was sparing with her snark, and thus the programme was greater for letting us make up our own minds. A truly enlightening couple of nights.', 'Not sure whether Leicester’s having a good year of it. It was at a nightclub there where one of the Chocolate Men – a troupe of 12 black strippers, who have, in co-founder Louis’s words, “to be good dancers and have a penis length of more than eight inches” – got carried away on his debut dance. In what must have been the most eggshell-fraught phrase uttered in voiceover this year, “Django allows a woman to briefly engage in oral sex with him”.', 'So many questions, which the makers of The Black Full Monty, Channel 4’s documentary about Britain’s first all-black male strip group, duly, if but occasionally, asked.', '“Some might say what you’re doing is perpetuating stereotypes?” “Are you selling sex, or are you selling race?” Louis and co-promoter Dante gamely tried to bat them back: “You can never satisfy everyone… anything you do as a black guy is going to be hard… it’s a stepping-stone, people are earning money, living good, what about that?” But I’m not sure we ever got an answer that would satisfy, say, the head of race and gender studies at Oxbridge Polyversity.', 'Perhaps, because there are so many questions about this, we should (as the makers tended to in the end) just see it a little bit of good dirty fun.

We are stratospheres above that now and TfL will be saddled paying for this, even in our uncertain future.”', 'Russell also accused the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, of trying to hide the full cost of the scheme.', '“Last year he told us the Silvertown road tunnel would cost £1bn, but now we finally see what TfL will actually pay and it’s heading for £2bn. This is outrageous.”', 'Transport for London said the existing cost of building the tunnel – around £1bn – had not increased. It said the additional costs covered in the £2bn figure included “ongoing operational costs … for 25 years as well as any maintenance and asset renewal required”.', 'There has been growing opposition to the project from local residents and green campaigners who say it would be environmentally destructive and undermine efforts to clean up the capital’s polluted air. They also argue it “fatally undermines” efforts to build a green recovery from the coronavirus – with dire consequences for some of London’s most vulnerable citizens.', 'Last week the shadow minister for climate change and local MP, Matthew Pennycook, added his voice, calling on Khan to abandon the scheme, saying “green transport must be the future of our city”.', 'If it goes ahead, the tunnel would be funded with a loan to be repaid by introducing tolls on the Blackwall and Silvertown tunnels.', 'The TfL accounts state the authority would repay £65m a year – index linked – between 2025 and 2050. At 1.6% [the current retail price index], that would lead to a total payment of about £2bn by 2050.', 'A Transport for London (TfL) spokesperson did not dispute the overall figure of £2bn but said the cost of building the Silvertown Tunnel – around £1bn – had not increased.', 'In a statement they added: “All payments towards the Silvertown tunnel will be funded from a road user charge, which will cover both the Blackwall and Silvertown Tunnel and will only begin once it is available for use, with payments linked to the performance of the contractor on key criteria such as availability.', '“These charges will not only repay the construction costs, but will also cover the ongoing operational costs for the tunnel for 25 years as well as any maintenance and asset renewal required.”', 'A spokesperson for the mayor said Khan “ has been clear that he doesn’t want to replace one health crisis with another, and he is determined that our city’s recovery from coronavirus will be clean, green and sustainable”.', 'The spokesperson said a new tunnel at Silvertown was crucial because the existing infrastructure was “antiquated and worn out”.', '“The tunnel will provide a public transport-focused river crossing with improved bus links across the Thames. The combination of introducing tolls on both the Blackwall tunnel and at Silvertown – and the extension of the ultra low emission zone from 2021 so that Silvertown will be within the area covered – will play a crucial role in tackling congestion and improving air quality.”', 'Steve Chambers, an independent transport consultant and academic at London South Bank University, said the £2bn price tag meant the scheme was an “expensive debt” for TfL to service.', '“The financial risks of the scheme are becoming clearer and there is no guarantee that the debt can be serviced from tolls alone.

Like millions of other little children all over the world with posters of Paddy Ashdown above their beds, you had a dream: to one day lead our boys in yellow. But unlike them, your dream came true.', 'Now, you’ll have noticed that people are very angry at the moment, about all kinds of different things: the coronavirus pandemic, Brexit, racism, climate breakdown, the economy, the Tories, the Labour party. And we want all of those people to vote for your friends and mine, the Lib Dems, at the next general election. So what we need is a statement that implies we’re like, good, but in the most general possible way. OK, hold on, now I think you might love this. What about: “I am listening”? It’s good, isn’t it? Hoof the ball right back into the public’s court. Great stuff. OK, here’s two free drink tokens – enjoy the party, champ.', 'I’m being a little unfair to Ed Davey here, and in any case, dunking on the Lib Dems is so easy it’s almost distasteful. His speech on winning the leadership contest last week was only the latest in a long line of politicians’ statements promising that their biggest priority was to listen to the electorate. William Hague made needing to listen the centrepiece of his 1998 party conference speech, and Tony Blair did the same at his party conference in 2000.', 'Listening has felt especially ubiquitous this year. Rory Stewart’s vampiric London mayoral campaign involved asking people to invite him across their thresholds for a chat and a sleepover, an idea that, in the era of social distancing, seems about as contemporary as a sprightly quadrille. Taking listening-as-home-invasion into the pandemic age, Keir Starmer has spent the summer doing Zoom-based listening tours of the country. And in the US a few weeks ago, Joe Biden assured young voters that he would “hear their voices”, too.', 'It’s not just politicians either. In the wake of George Floyd’s death, brands and institutions rushed to social media to confirm that they too were listening. Sweaty Betty is listening. The University of Hull is listening. PG Tips, with an upturned teacup pressed against your bedroom wall, is listening.', 'Why all this emphasis on listening? More often than not, it’s little more than an easy thing to say when you don’t want to alienate voters – or customers – by falling down hard on one side of an issue. Listening does form a central part of what MPs do locally in their constituencies through their regular surgeries, a term which makes the process sound about as appealing as getting your knee reset by Michael Fabricant.', 'Talking about listening to an entire population, however, is all too often an empty platitude or performance. And no wonder politicians don’t want to actually listen to public grievances when so much of what they would hear is unfiltered rage. Boris Johnson’s “People’s PMQs” stunt has seen him receive questions from the public such as “When will you resign for your mishandling of the pandemic?” and the ever-popular “How do you sleep at night?”', 'Political listening is always, in the end, a selective process. Listening to whom? Whomever’s opinion already aligns best with the party’s values? Both Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour and Nigel Farage’s Brexit party claimed to be about listening to people. And in any case, not all concerns are created equal. Tinfoil milliners concerned about whether China is beaming coronavirus into their homes via cellular data waves, or your local crank who wants to make it punishable by law not to thank the bus driver are, I would argue, less worthy of airtime than people concerned about the impacts of systemic racism.', 'A popular belief of the political centre in the UK is that the act of listening in and of itself can somehow bring wildly diverging opinion on contentious issues to an imagined point of agreement or compromise. Extinction Rebellion has attracted criticism for its emphasis on setting up a citizens’ assembly  to discuss what should be done to tackle the climate crisis. It’s a noble enough idea, but as they often emphasise, time is running out. We don’t need more conversation, we need widespread divestment from fossil fuels. When brands promise they are listening on Black Lives Matter, it implies that what is required is more testimony rather than more action. And Starmer’s inexhaustible appetite for holding inquiries is a slightly different but related urge – sure, we can take action on things, but only after we spend a great deal of time yakking about it.', 'In Leah Bassel’s book The Politics of Listening, she writes: “Politics means naming the social forces that deflect attention from particular voices, and is necessarily adversarial as well as active and creative.” It is never going to be enough just to listen; one has to take action against the forces that mean certain voices are unheard in the first place.

Will YOU comply?!” (“Yes, Jeremy,” I sigh.) “Do you know how the government is going to shrink your takeaway pizzas?!” (“No, Jeremy.”) “Should all hotels allow dogs?!” (“I don’t know, Jeremy, I’m just trying to write an article, how do I minimise you.”)', 'The actual show is basically an Old Man Yells At Cloud Olympics, where members of the public compete to see who can call in and complain about millennials the loudest. The Human Paperclip is always joined by two panelists: one a Daily Mail/Express columnist who squawks out stock phrases like “fishing rights” and “rule Britannia” like a xenophobic parrot, and the other a tired liberal who just wants to go back to 2015. Clippy presents one of the day’s stories to his panellists in as friendly a manner as he can (“It looks like you’re trying to start a culture war.

Each one has a plot that resonates with Channel 5’s core values (“stay indoors, trust no-one, everyone is trying to kill you”), and while they all feel like they could have been written by American rightwing shock-jock Bill O’Reilly after an all-night bender, The Killer Choice takes Best Screenplay for Totally Batshit Plot.', 'A war veteran EMT has to choose between saving a pregnant woman or a dying man during a convenience-store robbery. She chooses the pregnant woman, but 10 years later the wife of the man who died has become the boss of the EMT’s husband with the sole intention of hiring a hitman to kill the husband and her daughter in front of the EMT. This is just the first 20 minutes – I haven’t even got to the bit where the wife of the dead man feeds his ashes to a Venus flytrap while whispering: “It won’t be long now, John.” It is exhilaratingly bad, but I would happily watch it again and again.

We promised to keep speaking out about the climate emergency, despite the formidable and well-funded forces who would much rather the subject remained buried. We adopted new language to emphasise the existential nature of the situation. We pledged to deepen our environmental reporting.

We have published investigations, scientific analysis, reports on species extinction and air quality – and we have kept the voices of those affected by global heating at the heart of our reporting.', 'In the past year, we’ve reported from the Arctic and Antarctic, as well as other climate frontlines: the Amazon, the Sahara, the wildfires of Australia and the American west. We reported from the Cop25 summit of governments (travelling there by train). We have closely covered the movements trying to bring about change, such as Extinction Rebellion and the school climate strikes. We dug deep into the loss of wildlife, the problems of air pollution and microplastics, and exposed the most polluting companies on the planet.', 'We want our supporters to know: when you fund us, this is what you are paying for.', 'But of course this environmental year has been unique for another reason. A succession of related crises, not least the global Covid-19 pandemic, has brought a new perspective. These crises have starkly demonstrated how so many of our global problems – public health, migration, food security, land conflict, equality, gender and race – intersect with our environmental catastrophe.', 'For example, many researchers now see a correlation between species-jumping viruses such as Covid-19 and humanity’s deep, destructive incursion into the natural world. Links between high air pollution and increased coronavirus infection rates have also become apparent, thanks to persistent Guardian reporting.

It generates awareness of the problems – as well as the solutions. It galvanises protest and resistance, putting pressure on government and industry to make positive changes.

As Christiana Figueres, the UN’s climate chief when the Paris deal was sealed in 2015, told our environment editor, Damian Carrington: “Without the work of the Guardian the delivery of the Paris agreement would have been far harder or perhaps even impossible … At a time when the darkness of fake news and doubt in science is everywhere, the Guardian is a point of light.”', 'But words alone may not be enough.

Consequently, the rest of the summer of 68 remains something of a blur, but it’s not surprising that my memories are vague: the 1960s are over half a century ago now – a fact that, I suppose, makes them genuinely historical.', 'And yet, just before that same summer, the US was aflame with the most widespread riots in its history, following the assassination of Martin Luther King in April. Nine weeks later, in June, Robert Kennedy was also assassinated, and the autumn began with the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, in August, terminating the hopes of the Prague Spring with brutal efficiency.', 'Furthermore, 1968 had started with baleful auguries. In January, in Vietnam, the North Vietnamese army and the Vietcong launched the Tet offensive, almost overwhelming the might of the American and South Vietnam military. There were more than half a million US troops in Vietnam at the time. As spring ended, Parisian students and workers took to the capital’s streets, unleashing an eruption of civil strife that created a near revolution, effectively ending the era of Gaullism. And Germany was also convulsed with a social upheaval driven by students that shook society to its foundations, initiating the policy of Vergangenheitsbewältigung (“Coming to terms with the past”) that still dominates German political debate and culture today. The list of significant sociopolitical traumas that occurred in that year is a long one. It is one of those years, like 1789 or 1848 or 1914 or 1933, where, with a little hindsight operating, one can see a paradigm shift in the affairs of the world and its peoples. Maybe that will prove true of 2020, as well.', 'As I began researching the precise time and location of my new novel, Trio (I had plumped, almost on a whim, for 1968) the serendipitous wisdom of my choice became apparent. Suddenly I had a fascinating context for my characters and their secret lives – all involved in different ways, in the making of a zany, swinging 60s movie – that had a strangely global relevance. The comedy and the absurdity of the situation, plus the intensely private and personal lives of the characters, were ideally counterposed with the darker geopolitical state of the world.', 'The cataclysms happening abroad had their effect on British society but, compared with the rest of the world, we were caught up in that complacent, hedonistic, freewheeling era. Despite malign rumblings in the background – sectarian discrimination in Northern Ireland provoking unrest and confrontation; Harold Wilson’s Labour government’s singular inability to pacify or negotiate with the trade unions – the state of Britain in the second half of the 60s is usually starkly contrasted with what was going on in the rest of the world. Britain’s travails seemed small-scale and localised compared with the whirlwinds tearing through the US, France, Germany and Italy and elsewhere.', 'The counterculture in Britain was small and isolated – intellectual and well-to-do – there was nothing similar to the stridency and potency of the student movements elsewhere. However, the historical watershed that was the 1960s and its legacy – and the tipping-point that was 1968 – can still be seen, albeit transformed, today. Martin Luther King’s assassination shifted the civil rights movement into something altogether more radicalised and militant. In 1968, Eldridge Cleaver published the seminal text Soul On Ice, placing the Black Power movement in the foreground of African American political engagement. In Memphis, striking black workers marched silently in protest with large placards slung around their necks proclaiming “I am a man” in foot-high letters. It’s not a big jump to Black Lives Matter.', 'Later, the vicious pitched battles between demonstrators and police in Chicago at the Democratic National Convention effectively demolished the hopes of Hubert Humphrey being elected president and allowed Richard Nixon to cruise to victory on a “law and order” ticket. Sound familiar? The same effect could be witnessed this coming November.', 'Other parallels abound. The French riots of May 1968 found their echo in the confrontations in Paris by the gilets jaunes last year. The first demonstrations at the Miss America pageant in September by the Women’s Liberation Movement started a process that led to victory in many feminist battles, although the war is not won, yet. At the Mexico City Olympic Games in October, black American medal-winners raised their fists in Black Power salutes on the podium. Now they “take the knee”. Far-left protest groups began to emerge with more anarchic, utopian objectives. In the US, the Weather Underground briefly flourished. In Germany the leftwing student movement, the SDS, nurtured the seeds of the Red Army Faction. Urban terrorism was reborn – direct action, circumventing due legal process, became more popular. We see the same tendencies today in Extinction Rebellion, Pussy Riot, Femen and other radical human rights organisations.', 'Whatever they may have inculcated or initiated, the swinging 60s in Britain didn’t actually begin in 1960. The early 60s were remarkably like the 50s, but various crucial cultural signposts have been proposed as to when the party actually started. Was it in 1964, when the first Brook Clinic opened and unmarried women as young as 16 could be prescribed the contraceptive pill? Was it in July that year when the Rolling Stones had their first No 1 hit with “It’s All Over Now”? Or was it the day that the model Jean Shrimpton wore a dress with the hem cut five inches above the knee to the Melbourne Races in 1965 and sparked world-wide astonishment and condemnation – and the miniskirt was born?', 'Dominic Sandbrook, in his remarkable and compendious history of the era, White Heat, plausibly advances the key moment as something less ephemeral, occurring in January 1965 when Winston Churchill – who was born in 1874 – died. With Churchill’s death went the last symbol of British Victorian imperial hegemony, and all the national myths constructed around him, and by him, suddenly lost their objective correlative. We were just another mid-sized country slowly sliding down the road to relative powerlessness and moderate influence. It was time for a change and the change duly occurred, but not in the way the rest of the word experienced it. Sandbrook comments that, “Bearing in mind [Britain’s] self-conscious traditions of conservatism and pragmatism, the relatively comfortable conditions in the universities, the rather gloomy stability of its political life and the long continuity of its institutions, it is hardly surprising that Britain did not witness vast protests to compare with Paris in May 1968.”', 'It wasn’t all depressing however, there was fun to be had. Elvis Presley rebooted his career with massive weight loss and a Comeback Special; Stanley Kubrick’s film 2001: A Space Odyssey was released; Hair opened on Broadway; the Beatles didn’t break up, their White Album indicating that the show was still on the road, sort of; and the Apollo 8 astronauts successfully orbited the moon in the days leading up to Christmas.', 'So 1968 ended on something of an upbeat note – but the consensus was that many parts of the world had been through a particularly torrid, bleak and conflict-ridden period. In the editorial of its end-of-year issue, Time magazine summed up the preceding 12 months. “Seldom has the nation been confronted with such a congeries of doubts and discontents. While US prestige declined abroad, the nation’s self-confidence sank to a nadir at which it became a familiar litany that American society was afflicted with some profound malaise of spirit and will.” For the US, read the world.

Greenhouse gas emissions, heatwaves, wildfires, melting polar ice, floods, droughts, the annihilation of wildlife, air pollution … the problems grow more severe every year.', 'Of course, 2020 has been dominated by the coronavirus pandemic, but even here the correlation with environmental destruction is clear.', 'The “tip of the iceberg” – that was the warning early in the year, when we reported that many more viruses were present in wildlife and just waiting to be released by the human destruction of nature. The UN’s environment chief said “nature is sending us a message” that our abuse of the planet had consequences.', 'As critical as it is to tackle the damage caused by Covid-19, the root cause – the invasion of wild places and the exploitation of wild animals – is not being addressed, experts warned in the Guardian, despite the relatively tiny amount it would cost. Without action, even worse pandemics would happen, top scientists warned.', 'The cascade of pandemic impacts is also hitting food supplies in vulnerable places, with the Guardian highlighting fears of the worst food crisis in 50 years and a “famine of biblical proportions”. We also revealed how meat processing plants had become hotspots of Covid-19 infections among workers: “Everyone’s on top of you, sneezing and coughing,” one person told us.', 'While a temporary reduction in air pollution was a rare benefit of the pandemic, long-term exposure to dirty air appears to drive up Covid infections and deaths. The Guardian revealed the latest research, including a striking study providing compelling evidence of a link, as well as the discovery of the virus on pollution particle samples. Poor quality air might also help explain the disproportionate impact of Covid on minority ethnic communities, we revealed.', 'The coronavirus crisis is also an opportunity, however, with trillions of dollars being deployed to fund the recovery. In-depth series in both the UK and Australia set out how this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to put the world on track to tackle the climate crisis, transforming energy, transport, food and even aviation.', 'Of course, fossil fuel vested interests remain, and the Guardian exposed their lobbying for cash in the US, Australia and around the world. We also took a road trip around the UK to seek the views of ordinary people on the Covid recovery. The conclusion: few want a return to “normal”.', 'That normal would mean the relentless rise of global heating, with the brief cut in emissions during lockdown no more than a blip. Nowhere is that heating more obvious than in the oceans. In January, the Guardian’s print edition led its front page with the news of a record high ocean temperature in 2019, showing the “irrefutable and accelerating” heating of the planet.', 'The danger signs kept coming, and we kept reporting them, from the temperature in the Antarctic rising above 20C for the first time on record, to deforestation in the Amazon hitting its highest level in a decade.', 'One of the principal duties of the Guardian is to hold power to account. Our landmark series, The Polluters, revealed the 20 fossil fuel companies whose exploitation of oil, gas and coal reserves had caused more than one-third of all carbon emissions in the modern era, as well as Google’s funding of climate change deniers and the power of the car lobby.', 'In the US, the 100 days countdown series to the US withdrawal from the 2015 Paris agreement showed how the global climate fight could be lost if Donald Trump is re-elected and how worsening heatwaves are exacerbating systemic racial inequalities.', 'In Australia, the Guardian ran an agenda-setting interactive series, The Frontline, laying bare the climate emergency in the country. The starkest illustration were the devastating bushfires that raged through the summer months and were documented in The Summer of Dread and After the Bushfires projects.

We have championed the protesters, being at the UN in New York for Greta Thunberg’s emotional condemnation of world leaders, and exploring in depth the rise of Extinction Rebellion and how it can reinvent itself for a post-pandemic world. We also revealed that a quarter of all tweets about the climate crisis came from bots that amplified denialist messages.', 'Like the climate emergency, the annihilation of wildlife that threatens the air, water and food on which we depend has not gone away, and neither has the Guardian’s coverage of the crisis. In our Age of Extinction series we examined the deadly truth behind almond milk – “it’s like sending bees to war” – and, like all Guardian exclusives, this was followed up widely by other media.', 'We also revealed the $1m-a-minute farming subsidies that are ravaging the natural world and the mysterious mass die-off of hundreds of elephants in Botswana, and dug into the UK’s high-speed rail project’s impact on biodiversity and climate change.', 'The largest environmental cause of human disease and death in the world today is pollution, responsible for many millions of premature deaths. We have kept a sharp focus on this, revealing, for example, research linking air pollution to brain cancer for the first time.', 'Pollution takes many forms and we have reported in depth on the “cancer town” in the US where the risk of the disease is 50 times above the national average, and revealed that microplastic pollution is raining down on city dwellers, with as yet unknown effects on lung health.', 'Rivers have long suffered from pollution but we revealed the startling fact that water companies discharged raw sewage into English rivers more than 200,000 times in 2019. The only thing worse than dirty water is no water, and we exposed the scandal of millions of US citizens being unable to afford water bills.', 'While hard-hitting news is at the Guardian’s core, some stories need space to tell, such as our journey to Antarctica where we encountered the surprising sound of icebergs melting, and our long read on the career of the world’s most revered naturalist, Sir David Attenborough. Another extraordinary tale was that of Takaya, the lone sea wolf whose spirit captured worldwide attention.', 'We also know that finding solutions is vital in tackling the environmental challenges facing the world, which is why we reported from Darfur on how a water project was helping to end the “first climate change war” and how scientists created a mutant bacterial enzyme that broke down plastic bottles for recycling in hours.', 'In the UK, the good news included the benefits of beavers, which now have a permanent home in Devon as well as Scotland, and plans to rewild a large patch of East Anglia and to bring back wild bison for the first time in 6,000 years.', 'The Guardian’s commitment to environmental reporting has real world impacts, but these are rarely easy to measure. So it is useful to hear from those at the top.', 'Christiana Figueres, the UN’s climate chief when the Paris deal was sealed in 2015, said: “Without the work of the Guardian the delivery of the Paris agreement would have been far harder or perhaps even impossible.

At a time when the darkness of fake news and doubt in science is everywhere, the Guardian is a point of light.”', 'Bill McKibben, the leading climate writer and campaigner, said: “There is nothing in the English-language press that comes close to matching the scope and the commitment of the Guardian’s coverage of climate change.

https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/01/entitled-by-kate-manne-review-how-male-privilege-hurts-women,"['The ‘Philosopher of #MeToo’ examines the dynamics of male/female relationships in a fresh, illuminating way', 'This book doesn’t let up. What starts as a series of anecdotes about male privilege and how it motivates men to act in violent ways develops into a narrative about the corrosive effects of entitlement. Kate Manne, dubbed “the philosopher of #MeToo”, focuses particularly on the entitlement of men to goods provided by women. Misogyny is how women are policed and made to observe limitations, “a bit like the shock collar worn by a dog to keep them behind one of those invisible fences that proliferate in suburbia”.', 'Men demand from women that they give, among other things, consent, admiration, sex, bodily control and domestic labour. Each chapter describes how an entitlement works, with supporting examples. In the chapter “Involuntary – On the Entitlement to Admiration”, Manne cites incidents of self-described “incels” murdering women who have spurned them, or who they imagine have done so. What should feel like familiar territory, the retributive violence wreaked on women for rejecting men, is covered in an entirely new and illuminating way that frames such violence as a product of masculine hierarchy. Manne draws connections and expands her analysis beyond male/female power dynamics, making a strong case that these power dynamics are not about sex or women per se, but intersect frequently with racism.', 'With perspicacity and clear, jargon-free language, Manne keeps elevating the discussion to show how male privilege isn’t just about securing and hoarding spoils from women, but an entire moral framework. She rejects the notion that on one level men see women as inhuman, simply robotic or two-dimensional providers. Women do have volition and the capacity to choose for themselves, but it is when those choices do not align with what men want that things become difficult.', 'Manne explains how women of colour, trans women and other women made vulnerable by class or sexual orientation are subjected to the compounded effects of male entitlement. In the chapter “Incompetent – On the Entitlement to Medical Care”, a series of mishaps that result from medical practitioners in the US not taking women seriously makes for stomach-churning reading. Stories of black women losing fallopian tubes and babies because their pain was dismissed show our expectation of women as care providers, not care receivers. At every point, whether it was in the blood curdling recognition of the black woman being sent home with an aspirin as a foetus tore through her insides, or the comical identification with the writer being lectured to by a man about her own book, I felt Manne explaining to me, gently but relentlessly, that the state of being a woman is simply to provide and provide.', 'Perhaps the most revealing section deals with how women are shaped by this constant extension of themselves. The coronavirus lockdown has exposed the vast difference between the work men do at home and the amount of work they think they do. And women, so accustomed to defining themselves in terms of how well they care and provide for others, struggle to demand help.', 'But we cannot despair. The rage and sadness of the book is lifted by Manne’s final chapter in which she addresses her unborn daughter, wishing for her all the things she should feel entitled to – bodily autonomy, to speak her mind, to make mistakes. “It will be a ‘long interminable fight’,” Manne says of what lies ahead of her daughter, “but for her, I can say: I am in it.” For Manne’s daughter and many others, this book will make that fight a little bit easier.', 'Entitled is published by Allen Lane (£20).

I know many people around the world have been looking forward to this race and I am sorry to disappoint my fans, the organisers and my fellow competitors.”', 'Hugh Brasher, the event director of the race, tried to put a brave face on the news. “We know how disappointed Kenenisa is and we wish him a speedy recovery,” he said. “But this was never likely to be just a two-man race as we had four of the top-10 fastest marathon runners – and six men in the field who have broken 2:05, including Mosinet Geremew and Mule Wasihun, second and third last year, and the 2018 runner-up, Shura Kitata.”', 'The women’s race, which kicks off proceedings off at 7.15am on Sunday, should still live up to its billing as the world record holder, Brigid Kosgei, faces the world champion, Ruth Chepngetich, and the 2018 winner, Vivian Cheruiyot.

On the left are bills: a single sheet. On the right is a sheaf of letters from friends and lovers. “If the pile of letters is growing faster than the pile of bills, you’re on the right track,” says Rosell. “If it’s the other way round, you’re on the wrong track. It’s not that hard, the revolution I’m proposing.”', 'We are sitting on a wooden bench at a wooden table beneath a ceiling made of braided ribbons of wood, in Rosell’s house in the Cévennes, a mountain range in the south of France. Rosell looks like someone who has been fighting a revolution for half a century: untamed white hair, bare chest and feet, grubby black tracksuit bottoms. A weatherbeaten Robinson Crusoe, still hale and eager to take on cannibals – or capitalists – at 73.', 'He has lived here, far from any road or other habitation, since the 1970s, not long after spinning out, breathless and bloodied, from the 1968 student uprisings in Paris. Many of his rebel comrades urged a return to a simpler life, but few enacted it. He found a remote plot in the least densely populated region of France and built a bioclimatic home on it; that is, a house with low energy requirements and a light environmental footprint.', 'He hoarded rainwater, composted, recycled his waste water and heated his house with firewood and solar panels. Not for him salaried work, which he refers to as “five days of prostitution followed by two days of resuscitation”. He preferred to take what he needed – and no more – from nature. On the day I visit, he shows me a shallow pool filled with electric-green water, in which he grows the protein-rich algae spirulina: delicious, he says, with olive oil and garlic. It complements a diet rich in wild plants: 70 species altogether, which he gathers from the forest.', 'Rosell currently lives alone. He does not believe in marriage and never had kids, he says, but people passed through. Some came out of curiosity, and left again; others moved in. He taught those who were interested how to live as self-sufficiently as possible. Young people bold enough to venture to his University of Applied Collective Ecology built walls out of crushed sunflowers and cow dung, motors that ran on seaweed, and reed beds that transformed sewage into drinking water. It was emphatically experimental, and it did not always work. But his approach, dismissed as eccentric by his contemporaries, appeared increasingly sensible to generations fearful that humanity had damaged the planet beyond repair, then urgent to the growing number of his compatriots who feel that their society is on the verge of collapse.', 'The belief that we are heading for some kind of all-consuming crisis is not exclusively French, of course. Serious scientists all over the world are discussing it. Wealthy Americans were buying spots in Armageddon-proof bunkers long before Covid-19, and militant environmental and social protest movements have been on the rise everywhere. Within Europe, however, a survey published last November by the left-leaning French thinktank the Jean Jaurès Foundation found that only Italy beat France for pessimism about the future. Seventy-one per cent of Italians and 65% of French people agreed with the statement that “civilisation as we know it will collapse in the years to come”; 56% of Brits shared that apocalyptic vision – slightly ahead of Americans, at 52% – while Germans came in last with a sanguine 39%.', 'In 2015, two Frenchmen, Pablo Servigne and Raphaël Stevens, who describe themselves as independent researchers, co-wrote an essay entitled How Everything Can Collapse, in which they introduced the term “collapsology”. In a long interview Servigne gave to Philosophie magazine this year, he explained that, at first, their neologism was tongue-in-cheek. The concept must have struck a chord, though, because within a couple of years he found himself at the head of a movement, and this summer the word collapsologie entered the popular French dictionary Le Petit Robert. “We created a monster,” Servigne told Philosophie.', 'For the authors of the Jean Jaurès study, the political scientist Jérôme Fourquet and the pollster Jean-Philippe Dubrulle, collapsology is driven at least in part by economic factors. The least apocalyptically minded country they polled, Germany, also has (or had, pre-Covid-19) the strongest economy, while the countries where the movement has the largest following – Italy and France – are those where economic performance has been poorest of late, and social and political tensions run high.', 'They deliberately left their statement vague as to the causes of the coming collapse, because people in different countries think differently about these. In Britain and Germany, the emphasis is on the climate crisis, as seen in the emergence of Extinction Rebellion in the UK. But in France, where they overlap to some extent with the gilets jaunes movement, collapsologists also consider society to be sick. The idea is that rampant consumerism, ever-accelerating technological advances and the dominance of neoliberalism are leading French people to perdition.', 'It is probably for this reason, say Fourquet and Dubrulle, that France stands apart from the other countries they surveyed in one important way: whereas in general the movement is strongest in the under-35 age group, “in our country, all generations, the 65-and-overs included, share the same sombre diagnosis”.', 'The movement also cuts across political boundaries, embracing everyone from the far right to the far left. One of the most outspoken collapsologists is Yves Cochet, a politician with Europe Ecology – France’s green party – and a former environment minister in Lionel Jospin’s leftwing government of the early 00s. He has retreated to a farmhouse in Britanny and reputedly has not seen the inside of a plane since 2009. But there are also French “survivalists” who – at least until about a decade ago – shared the drawbridge mentality of the Americans stocking up on peanut butter and ammo.', 'After the financial crisis of 2008, says Bertrand Vidal, a sociologist at the University of Montpellier who studies these groups, the predominantly rightwing, libertarian survivalists shifted closer to Servigne and Stevens’s softer, back-to-nature school of how-to-avert-the-worst, with its emphasis on sustainability. Differences between them remain, but one thing they share is a neo-Malthusian conviction that there are too many people on Earth. Even those who overtly criticise capitalism believe in a post-apocalyptic winnowing of the human species, in which nature will determine who lives and who dies. “They use the analogy of the grasshopper and the ant,” Vidal says, referring to the fable in which the ant survives the winter because it prepared for cold weather, while the improvident grasshopper expires.', 'The uncertainty created by ongoing financial instability, climate change and now Covid-19 has shrunk the ideological distance between the two camps still further, while at the same time swelling their followings. “People hesitate to call themselves collapsologists or survivalists,” says Vidal. “Nevertheless, I’ve noticed that it has become a subject of general preoccupation. It’s no longer restricted to a minority of fanatics.”', 'These days it is mainly a middle-class phenomenon, in part because you have to have the means to be able to contemplate a radical life change. You probably also grew up with certain expectations that you perceive to have been frustrated by the deteriorating state of the world. “These are people who don’t see a future and who, in searching for a sense to their social disqualification, find it in this idea of the end of the world,” says Vidal. It is also markedly urban – as it was in the 70s – being fuelled by a romanticised image of what it means to live self-sufficiently in a low-tech, rural setting. For that reason, most collapsologists are content to discuss their anxieties, without acting on them.', 'Servigne acted. Born in Versailles in 1978, he studied agronomy in Belgium before completing a PhD in sociobiology. The subject of his thesis was cooperation in ants. It was the early 00s, and the scientific consensus was moving away from the idea that cooperative behaviour is genetically determined – you only help your kin – to one that said the environment matters too: social animals band together in harsh conditions, even if they are not related, because their survival depends on it. This chimed with arguments he had heard in anarchist circles, and after his second son was born, he and his family left their cramped apartment in Brussels – and the academic life – to move closer to nature and likeminded people.', 'They ended up in the Drôme, a mountainous region in south-east France near Grenoble, living close to a forest where the children regularly glimpse birds of prey, wild boar, even wolves. Ironically, Servigne himself does not have time to garden – he is too busy leading a movement – but growing food is central to the family’s and community’s lifestyle. And though he and Stevens have yet to publish their vision of how best to live in the shadow of collapse – it is a work-in-progress – central to it is the concept of permaculture: living off the land, durably. Permaculture embraces organic and traditional forms of farming, but it can also extend to other domains of life: recycling, barter, homeschooling.', 'Unlike Cochet, who claims that things will fall apart in 2030 – in a series of mainly climatic catastrophes that will eliminate half the world’s population – Servigne does not predict when the collapse will happen. Indeed, he thinks we may already have entered the endgame. (Among scientists, there is a parallel debate over whether the people of lost civilisations, such as the Minoans or the Hittites, realised their societies were collapsing.)', 'Nor does he claim to have all the answers, though he believes that salvation lies in slow, local, group-based solutions. “Small is beautiful,” he says. In the eyes of many French people he has taken on the status of a guru, not unlike Greta Thunberg internationally (she herself has been compared to an earlier French guru, Joan of Arc). And although he insists that his thinking is grounded in science, he does not shy away from accusations that his crusade has a religious dimension. For him, it is impossible to think about humanity’s place on the planet without engaging in spiritual or philosophical reflection. Science, after all, has provided a diagnosis but no workable solutions to date.', 'Collapsology has plenty of detractors. The philosopher Jean-Pierre Dupuy, of the École Polytechnique in Paris and Stanford University in California, has two major criticisms. The first is that, despite vaunting their scientific credentials, collapsologists have misunderstood the fundamental nature of complex systems, whether they be ecological, financial, social or climatic. Servigne, for example, contends that the more globalised and connected human societies become, the more vulnerable they are to disruption. This is plainly wrong, says Dupuy. “It is in their complexity that both the resilience and the vulnerability of systems lie, meaning that collapse is far from a given, just because the system becomes more complex.”', 'Second, by predicting collapse on a certain date – as Cochet does – collapsologists shoot themselves in the proverbial foot. They are effectively saying that nothing we do will make any difference, but if that is true, we might as well sit back and wait for the end. They risk either engendering fatalistic resignation or, if people do act, being proved wrong. If their goal is to avert the calamity, they should prefer the second option. “The curse of the prophet of doom is to be condemned to be a false prophet,” says Dupuy.', 'He acknowledges that he is taking risks of his own, in criticising the collapsologists, because the threats to humanity are real, and they include the indifference of the vast majority of us. It is possible, though far from certain, that Covid-19 will wake us up; that people will see it as a taste of what is to come. Collapsologists read the pandemic differently. Bizarre as it may seem, says Vidal, many greeted it enthusiastically – as vindication. “For them, the catastrophe represents a sort of tabula rasa, a sweeping away of the errors of the past, and a step closer to the day when society will reboot itself.”', 'Yogan Bredel-Samson, a carpenter and builder who is raising a family in a bioclimatic cabin in the woods of the Dordogne, as part of a community of nature-loving artisans and artists, says: “When the coronavirus came, we were very happy to have our old ploughs and wooden tools, our gardens and horses.” He credits Rosell for inspiring his life change – he was a student at the latter’s alternative university 20 years ago – but says that what he took from that experience was how to live sustainably. Rosell’s politics, which he considered extreme, left him cold. “I’m against supermarkets,” he says, “not money.”', 'Meanwhile, Rosell continues his life’s experiment. Before I leave, he shows me a sweet chestnut sapling he has grafted on to an oak, in the hope that it will one day bear fruit. He does not fear Covid-19, having confidence in his immune system, because he has nourished it properly all these years. Does he see the pandemic as a warning?

Should that change be made permanent?', 'Hollingbury golf course is a big splodge of green bleeding into Brighton’s grey urban sprawl. For more than a century, its 18 holes have risen above the seaside city towards the ruins of an iron age hillfort, which is now enclosed by holes nine, 12, 13, and 14. From Hollingbury’s highest point, it is possible to look west on a clear day and see the hills of the Isle of Wight.', 'As housing has spread around the course, which is owned by the council, so has tension between golfers and walkers, who are permitted to cut across it on a network of footpaths and old drovers’ tracks. Relations seem calm on the autumn day I visit, but I gather “Fore!” is not the only four-letter exclamation to have bounced along the manicured fairways.', 'In late March, the awkward relationship flipped on its head when a lockdown ban on golf coincided with a yearning for green space among Britain’s confined households. A national campaign, supported by the Brighton MP Caroline Lucas, called for golf courses to be opened to the public to relieve crowded parks.', 'At Hollingbury, which has no fences and is part of the South Downs national park, residents responded like calves put out to pasture. They cartwheeled on the fairways and picnicked on the greens. “It was like being in the mountains up here, with that open-space feeling that makes you feel immediately better,” says Michaela Spryanova, an office administrator who lives just beyond the course’s western edge.', 'Rachel Henson, an artist and translator, came here every day, basking in the spring sunshine and sweeping views over Brighton and the Channel. She taught her daughter to ride a bike on the sloping fairway of hole 10. “We learned all the common birdsong together,” she says.', 'But then, in June, golf was permitted once more – and golfers reclaimed the course. “We knew it was coming, but it was a terrible shock,” Henson says as we walk with Spryanova from their children’s school after the morning drop-off. We stroll up towards the hillfort on one of the old paths to which non-golfers are again confined. “It depressed me so much I couldn’t come up here for a while,” Henson adds.', 'The struggle for space at Hollingbury – and a second council-owned golf course two miles to the west at Waterhall – reflects a wider debate about conservation, ecology and democratic access to green space. As a pandemic triggers a revolt on many of Britain’s fairways, it poses a vexed question: is it time we opened up all golf courses to the public for good?', 'One of the joys and challenges of golf is that it requires a lot of nice green space. How much space is disputed. A common claim that Britain’s golf courses occupy more land than housing is based on dodgy estimates, but it is a lot of land.', 'The American writer Malcolm Gladwell once considered the scale of gated golf courses in Los Angeles, a city of few parks. He calculated that if you gave each player on a basketball court the space a golfer commands, the court would cover 12 hectares (30 acres); the hoops would be more than 400 metres apart. “They’d have to play on motorcycles,” Gladwell wrote.', 'Yet this calculation depends on a course being busy. Not all courses are busy. Steve Garrioch, who has been the captain at Hollingbury since 2009, tells me he was one of significantly more than 500 members when he joined 20 years ago. There are now 122 members and about twice as many season-ticket holders.', 'Garrioch, a leather merchant, blames an oversupply: Hollingbury is one of six courses within five miles of Brighton Palace pier in a city of about 300,000 people. But its decline is not unusual. According to a participation report by KPMG late last year, membership of golf courses in Great Britain dropped to a low of slightly more than 850,000, down almost 20,000 in a year. In Scotland, membership has dropped by 14% since 2014. Yet the number of courses – more than 2,000 – is relatively stable.', 'Hollingbury, which opened in 1908, is not exclusive. “It’s for working-class people,” Garrioch says. “We’ve got taxi drivers, builders … there’s nothing elite about it.” Yet perceptions fuelled the debate about the role of courses in lockdown. “I think a certain US president has done golf no favours,” says Guy Shrubsole, a campaigner and the author of Who Owns England?. For Shrubsole, Donald Trump – and the eponymous courses on which he has played out a large part of his presidency – exemplifies the image of golf as a gated, gilded pursuit.', 'In early April, when many councils threatened to shut the gates of crowded parks, Shrubsole launched a petition at change.org calling for golf courses to be opened. More than 7,500 people signed it. Lockdown was highlighting space inequality; studies show that people in poorer postcodes not only have smaller gardens, or none at all, but also less access to smaller parks.', 'Pushing open the gates of golf courses began to feel like a moral imperative. “There’s a sense that golf is played by a small number of people and that they are potentially quite wealthy, retired, white men who don’t necessarily represent society,” Shrubsole says.', 'It is not known how many courses opened to the public. It was a fraught process for many that did. “We had nudity on the greens and kids riding bikes straight over the bunkers,” Garrioch says. Elsewhere, there were reports of quad biking, horse riding and rampant picnicking. One couple were spotted playing a rather different sport in a bunker at Glenbervie golf club near Falkirk in central Scotland. “This isn’t Butlin’s,” an anonymous member of the club told the Daily Record. “It’s frustrating that members aren’t even allowed to get their daily exercise by playing a round on their own in the fresh air, yet you’ve got locals having sex in the bunkers. Where’s the social distancing in that?”', 'But for the responsible majority, including Henson, Spryanova and their families, the overnight arrival of new parks was a revelation. “I wanted to shift debate and say there was something deeper going on here – this was about our exclusion from public space and our inability to provide enough of it,” Shrubsole says.', 'That debate was big in Brighton before the pandemic. Ten-year management contracts at Hollingbury and Waterhall were due to expire on 31 March. “It came up at pretty much my first committee meeting last year,” says Marianna Ebel, a German-born IT engineer who was elected as a Green party councillor for Goldsmid ward in May 2019.', 'Brexit inspired Ebel, 35, to enter local politics. She is now the joint chair of the council’s tourism, equalities, communities and culture committee, so council-owned golf courses are her responsibility. For a while, it was assumed a new operator would simply take over the leases. “But I remember looking at the membership numbers,” Ebel says. “I thought: ‘Instead of continuing, how about rewilding the courses?’”', 'In October, the council appointed an estate agent to market the courses, offering 25-year management leases. But they also invited bids for other uses, including projects to restore the wildlife-rich chalk grassland on which the courses were laid.', '“We simply cannot miss this exciting opportunity to create a health & wellbeing sanctuary and a wildlife haven for all,” read a petition launched in late December by the Brighton branch of Extinction Rebellion (XR), the environmental campaign group. Counter-petitions called for golf to be saved. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrats in the city pushed for the space to be used for affordable housing.', 'More than 5,000 people signed the rewilding petition, including Chris Packham, the presenter and campaigner. In January, XR Brighton held a protest outside a committee meeting. They marched on Hollingbury. “We’re not anti-golf,” insists Ben Benatt, an ecology surveyor and XR member. “It’s about a sustainable solution that addresses the climate and biodiversity emergency.”', 'In January, the council awarded a new contract for Hollingbury, securing its future as a golf course. It was a blow to campaigners and the families who had roamed the course. But the council also announced that Waterhall, where membership was in steeper decline, would shut down for a rare experiment: the rewilding of a golf course.', '“They call chalk grassland rainforests in miniature,” says Kim Greaves, as we crouch low on the first green at Waterhall. The 37-year-old played here briefly as a teenager. These days, he works with adults with learning disabilities and teaches Brazilian jujitsu, a martial art that relies on skilful leverage. He is also an amateur naturalist and part of the campaign to restore Waterhall.', 'Golfers abandoned the course when lockdown stopped play just seven days before the old lease expired. It had stood here since 1923. Six months later, the greens are cracking up. Daisies and ragwort are growing and the old holes and bunkers are filling with soil and debris.', 'The clubhouse, which sits just above the first green, has sweeping downland views. There is one proposal to move the building towards a rugby club, where dog walkers now park to enjoy the old course, and turn it into an education centre. For now, it is a symbol of a lost era. Abandoned trophies left in the window of the Spike Bar collect dust next to a golf glove, on which a large bumblebee has expired.', 'The very thin layer of soil that covers chalk in valleys across the south-east of England – the result of centuries of grazing – lets rain drain straight through it. Nutrients are scant, so dominant grasses, and the shrubs and trees that would succeed them, tend not to do well. Instead, an array of resilient wildflowers cling to the earth, supporting rare species of butterfly and birds.', 'Diversity on the old greens is still low; it will take years for the effects of mowing and pesticides to be flushed out. But Greaves wants to show me what is happening on the fringes of the fairways. Wildflowers with evocative names – betony, harebell, devil’s-bit scabious, lady’s bedstraw – are creeping in from the rough.', '“I even saw a round-headed rampion in the middle of the fairway,” Greaves says of a survey he did in the summer. “It might have been there without flowering for decades.” The delicate blue flower, also known as the Pride of Sussex, is a magnet for the chalkhill blue butterfly.', 'Rewilding here will require management. Without any intervention, ecological succession will do its thing, even on thin soil. Last month, the council took responsibility for the project after a leaseholder pulled out. Greaves is anxious to start controlling the hawthorn that is already dominating areas between fairways. In other ecosystems, big fauna would do this kind of work. “Perhaps we’ll introduce elephants here eventually,” Greaves says with a smile.', 'Golf still offers pleasure and exercise to hundreds of thousands of people. Many clubs enjoyed a growth in visitor numbers when they reopened in June; golf is nothing if not a socially distanced sport. Even XR Brighton says a sensitively managed links is far from the worst way to preserve green space, “especially if it brings a revenue stream that can help manage it in the right way”, Benatt says.', 'Housing can be an obvious – and lucrative – alternative, especially when privately owned courses can rescue their finances with a sale to developers. Reading golf club, another old, struggling course, will next year merge with Caversham Heath, a club two miles to the west. A controversial housing development will take its place.', 'But Waterhall’s fate adds weight to campaigns for old courses to remain green yet public, making permanent the freedom that excluded communities briefly enjoyed this year. Four years ago, Lewisham council closed a municipal 18-hole golf course that had occupied an old Georgian estate in Beckenham, south-east London. It is now a public park with a restored lake for swimming and boating. “It shows what local campaigns can do,” Shrubsole says.', 'It will take time for balance to be restored at Hollingbury. Today, walkers and joggers outnumber golfers by far. “It’s just getting ridiculous,” says Brian Coomber, a club member who is looking for his ball in the rough next to the 10th fairway. He says people have been using the footpaths way more since golf resumed, interrupting play and messing up the fairways. “Don’t get me wrong, I’ve got a dog myself, but at the end of the day this isn’t common land,” he says. His friend, Dave Slocombe, nods in agreement. Days later, the men leave Hollingbury to join East Brighton golf club, which is only three miles away.', 'Henson and Spryanova still walk on Hollingbury, where Spryanova says a few comments from golfers have made her children feel uncomfortable on their walk to school. Lockdown inspired Henson’s art. She made videos of the course, in which images of cartwheeling children fade into more recent footage of golf. Birds sing in the background. As we stand at the hillfort, taking in the sweep of Brighton, she can still picture those weeks. “At sunset, everyone would have been sitting here looking west, each little group taking a mound,” she says. “It looked a bit like a very spaced out village green.”', 'This article was amended on 27 October 2020 because an earlier version mistakenly said that “Liberal Democrat councillors pushed for the space to be used for affordable housing”.

The police had come to riot. Wielding batons, they stormed forward yelling, “Kill Davis!” he recalls. He was cracked on the head, knocked to the ground and felt lucky to escape with his life.', 'It could be a scene from this year’s summer of civil unrest in America. In fact it was a demonstration outside the 1968 Democratic national convention in Chicago that descended into a violent clash with police and the national guard.', 'The story of Davis and other organisers of the protest is told in The Trial Of The Chicago 7, a film written and directed by Aaron Sorkin that premieres on Netflix on 16 October. Its star-studded cast includes Sacha Baron Cohen, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Michael Keaton, Frank Langella, Eddie Redmayne and Mark Rylance.', 'In an interview with the Guardian, Davis, 80, says he was not consulted during production of the film and expresses serious reservations about how he and fellow activists are portrayed. But he also welcomes the timeliness of its release.', '“Coming out at this time is just really perfection,” he says by phone from his home near Boulder, Colorado. “There are some things that I wouldn’t agree with how Sorkin has characterised certain figures in the trial, myself included. But the impact of the movie is there and I certainly endorse and support it.”', 'The tumult of 2020 – a global pandemic, economic crisis, an uprising over racial injustice – has frequently been compared to 1968, when the Vietnam war was raging, Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were assassinated and major cities were engulfed by violence.', 'From a farm community in Michigan, Davis’s political awakening came in the early 60s. He helped created Students for a Democratic Society, effectively the voice for students in the north. Davis was an activist and community organiser and joined the antiwar movement in around 1965.', 'By the summer of 1968, Americans were dying at a rate of more than 1,000 per month in the worst year of the Vietnam war. Davis became the national coordinator of a coalition of 150 organisations dedicated to nonviolence that went to Chicago.', '“Our initial plan was to bring 500,000 people to Chicago and it was simply because the mayor refused to grant permits that the numbers reduced, but the result was a police riot. That’s how a presidential commission defined what happened. But it was watched on television by more people than watched the moment the first man landed on the moon. It was incredible.”', 'Eventually the city did grant a permit for a demonstration in Chicago’s Grant Park that was so benign it included parents with babies. Davis remembers that a young person lowered a flag to half-staff, later explaining it as a symbol of international distress.', '“The police saw the flag coming down and basically came in and beat people as they arrested this person. We had a very highly organised team of close to 4,000 marshals so I was able to put up a human chain where arms were linked.', '“We faced out towards the police to just bring the whole situation under complete control in a matter of minutes. Then I announced to the police that we have a permit and you can see we are able to secure this properly, so if you could withdraw, that would be in everybody’s best interest, or words to that effect.', '“That just set off the police and they came crashing in. As they approached me, I literally could hear police yelling, ‘Kill Davis!’ I was hit on the head and knocked to the ground. I was on the ground crawling with my two arms trying to get away and just being clubbed and clubbed and clubbed. I think what saved me that day, honestly, was a little chain fence in the park. I was able to get under the chain fence and it gave me three seconds to get away, stand up and get on the other side. I did pass out for a while.”', 'Davis went to hospital and was given 13 stitches and managed to avoid arrest. “The police realised I was seen as the organiser of this event so they came into the hospital and did a room-by-room search trying to find me to arrest me. One of the most amazing things of the impact we were having on the city is that there were nurses who literally risked their entire career.', '“This was a county hospital, they were employees of the county, and they put me on a trolley and covered me with a sheet and literally moved me from room to room to evade the police search until I could get to an exit and get out. I did, and didn’t get arrested. It really is amazing. Even today I think: wow, that was some courage there.”', 'But the incoming Richard Nixon administration successfully pushed for the purported ringleaders of the protest – including Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Tom Hayden and Davis – to be charged with conspiracy to incite a riot. They were originally the “Chicago Eight”, but the case against the Black Panther leader Bobby Seale – who was silenced in court by being bound and gagged – was eventually dropped.', 'A chaotic and raucous trial began in 1969 and forms the backbone of the Netflix movie. Davis continues: “The trial went forward with eight people and, on the opening day, the New York Times said on the front page: ‘This is the most significant political trial in American history’ – and it certainly lived up to its billing.', '“Certainly none of us want to go to prison for many years, so it’s not to say we weren’t mindful of the likely outcome, but quite honestly this was a group of people, myself included, who really saw the opportunity to basically speak to the country about the Vietnam war. We had different styles and we came from different organisations but, while the movie characterises us as squabbling and fighting a fair amount, it really wasn’t the case.”', 'When the trial ended each day at 4.30pm, the accused, out on bail, would travel far to deliver speeches to crowds of thousands of people. “This was every night with every defendant and people were stamping their feet and screaming. It was really that support of, especially, students that made such a difference.', '“We also had press conferences at the lunch break that were larger than the press conference at the White House: the entire world press was present in a massive room that could barely hold everybody. All three networks carried our story pretty much as the lead story every single day for six months.”', 'The trial lasted five and a half months. At one point all the defendants read the names of people who lost their lives in Vietnam. Five, including Davis, were found guilty of inciting a riot and all seven, plus their lawyer, were sentenced to prison terms for contempt of court. The convictions were reversed on appeal.', 'Davis became friendly with John Lennon and proposed that the onetime Beatle undertake a 42-city tour to revive the waning antiwar movement and raise funds for local causes. The first was held in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1971, but was so successful that Nixon tried to to have Lennon deported and the tour was abandoned.', 'Davis still recalls the day when Lennon took him to a recording studio in Manhattan: “Basically the entire audience is just me and Yoko and we sit there and I still don’t know what’s going to happen. John starts and he’s basically recording the final overdub of Imagine. It was really spectacular.”', 'He moved to Colorado and set up a business, consulting to chief executives of Fortune 500 companies. But his counterculture streak also saw him living alone at the bottom of the Grand Canyon for four years. “Today I teach earth whispering, how to basically deepen yourself and become more self aware and things like that. It was largely triggered by that Grand Canyon experience.”', 'Davis is played by Alex Sharp in the movie. Sorkin, known for the White House TV drama The West Wing and the Facebook origin story The Social Network, started writing the screenplay in 2007, but filming did not begin until late 2019. It is his second go in the director’s chair, following Molly’s Game in 2017.', 'Davis has mixed feelings about the finished product. “I was the coordinator of the coalition that went to Chicago and I brought back American prisoners of war from Vietnam at a time when places where I was living were being bombed by US military. In the movie, I’m made out to be a complete nerd who’s afraid of his own shadow.”', 'He adds: “Sorkin was seven years old when the trial was occurring and clearly had no understanding of the defendants or, maybe more importantly, the tens of millions of people that were just passionately supporting us.”', 'Half a century later, Donald Trump is again swimming against the tide of public opinion, according to every poll, by playing down police brutality and using the Nixon “law and order” playbook to seek re-election. Hoffman, Rubin and Hayden are no longer alive but for Davis, the echoes are inescapable. “Of course, there are very decent police officers in every state but the systemic racism in the police department just can’t be denied.', '“It’s very similar to the anti-war movement. There was a period where the protests represented a segment of society but gradually the anti-war movement came to represent the majority of society and that’s exactly what I see happening now. It is Black Lives Matter but it’s also the women’s movement and the youth movement and the environmental movement and the Extinction Rebellion movement and how they see themselves as basically being, in a way, one voice.', '“They don’t have the kind of coalition that we had in the 60s but I suspect that’s going to be coming.

But who is its secretive puppet master?', 'One Sunday in August, two weeks after Belarus’s authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko declared an implausibly decisive victory in presidential elections, I joined a crowd of around 100,000 people as it moved through central Minsk. Protest in Belarus was no longer the domain of a few hundred hardy opposition figures, and the homemade placards many people carried illustrated how broad the coalition had become: “Let’s drink to love, from the bartenders of Belarus”; “Teachers against violence”; “Working class, go on strike!”', 'The previous fortnight had been a time of national awakening, as the country united around the goal of ending Lukashenko’s 26 years in charge. As grim footage of police violence circulated on the messenger app Telegram, large numbers came out to demand that their voices be heard.', 'The enormous crowd began to flow from Independence Square, through the broad central avenues of Minsk towards a second world war memorial – because many people had received messages on their phones telling them to head there. When we arrived, the monument had been surrounded by barbed wire and placed under armed guard. Some people shouted abuse; others offered the soldiers flowers and implored them to join the side of the people. After a tense, half-hour standoff, they looked down at their phones again. Mobile internet was not working for everyone (the authorities had been switching it off at key moments) but those tech-savvy enough to install the right virtual private network (VPN) apps were able to relay the news.', 'The first place they looked was Nexta Live (pronounced “Nekhta” and meaning “someone” in Belarusian), a channel on Telegram. “Nexta says we should go towards the residence!” one man called out, joining a column of people making the short walk to Lukashenko’s official residence. Outside was a police line: cars, makeshift fences and a few hundred riot officers in balaclavas with shields. It was clear that attempting to push through would result in bloody clashes. Again, advice flashed up in the Nexta Telegram feed. “Minsk! Do not approach the police line! The best decision now is to disperse.” The crowd did just that. Since then, every Sunday, they have come out; each week, Nexta has announced the time and place of the protest a day or two before.', 'Telegram, a messaging app created by the reclusive Russian exile Pavel Durov, is suited to running protests for a number of reasons. It allows huge encrypted chat groups, making it easier to organise people, like a slicker version of WhatsApp. And its “channels” allow moderators to disseminate information quickly to large numbers of followers in a way that other messaging services do not; they combine the reach and immediacy of a Twitter feed, and the focus of an email newsletter. The combination of usability and privacy has made the app popular with protestors (it has been adopted by Extinction Rebellion) as well as people standing against authoritarian regimes (in Hong Kong and Iran, as well as Belarus); it is also used by terrorists and criminals. In the past five years, Telegram has grown at a remarkable speed, hitting 60 million users in 2015 and 400 million in April this year. Each day, another 1.5 million people sign up.', 'In Belarus, it permeates the political landscape. Opposition politicians issue press releases on a Telegram channel; journalists swap tips about where things are happening and how to avoid being detained; and people who have been tortured or beaten by Lukashenko’s thugs can find groups offering free medical or psychological support. Most importantly, Nexta Live and a number of smaller opposition channels feed subscribers with organisational information and rallying cries.', '“How can you stop these Telegram channels? Can you block them? No. Nobody can,” Lukashenko complained. But if he can’t beat Telegram, he has decided to join it instead. On the Sunday I followed protesters through Minsk, Lukashenko took off from his residence in a helicopter and flew over us. Later, his press service posted video footage, shot from inside the helicopter, to his newly created Telegram channel: the leader, dressed in black and wielding an automatic rifle, surveyed the crowds below; “They’ve scarpered like rats,” he muttered, as he peered down from the windows. Lukashenko was meant to appear uncompromising and in control, but the video was quickly copied to opposition Telegram channels, overlaid with insulting captions, voiceovers and memes, and seen there by far more. At the time of writing, Lukashenko’s channel has 86,000 subscribers, while Nexta Live has almost 2 million, an impressive feat in a country of fewer than 10 million. Last month, Belarusian authorities declared Nexta’s channel and logo to be “extremist materials” in an unsuccessful attempt to scare followers off.', 'It is a common trope for embattled autocrats to claim that protesters are in fact puppets in the hands of nefarious foreign plotters. This summer, Lukashenko suggested that his opponents were backed by the massed armies of Nato, or shadowy forces in Washington DC. But the truth is rather more embarrassing: his nemesis is a 22-year-old blogger working from a room strewn with pizza boxes 300 miles away.', 'Two weeks after that Sunday in Minsk, I meet with Stepan Svetlov at Nexta’s makeshift headquarters, inside the office of an NGO in a Warsaw apartment block. After buzzing me in, Svetlov appears at the apartment door in baggy jeans and a blue sweatshirt. There are armed police outside; unsurprisingly, given the volume of threats the group receives. “We get them all the time. They say they’re going to blow the office up, they say they’re going to kidnap us and drive us back to Belarus,” Svetlov tells me. We sit down in the room from which he and four others run Nexta. It contains a couple of computers, and a table covered with blue takeaway coffee cups.', 'Svetlov, who only recently turned 22, has not been to Belarus for two years. His parents were there until recently, but have now left the country, having been advised by friends with government contacts that things might get dangerous. “At the start of all this, my mum was quite sceptical, but now she has started to support me,” Svetlov says. Has it been a shock for his parents that their son is now seen as the revolution’s puppet master? “You could say they were quite surprised,” he says, smiling.', 'Svetlov launched Nexta as a YouTube channel in 2015, shortly before the last round of elections in Belarus. “Nobody to vote for/ Only mustachioed portraits everywhere,” ran the lyrics to a song that formed the channel’s first post. Nexta’s sharply satirical videos about Belarusian politics swelled subscriber numbers to 100,000, and quickly brought it to the attention of the authorities. A clip Svetlov made entitled “Lukasherlock”, about the Belarusian president’s claims to have solved a crime overnight, was deemed to be in potential violation of a law on insulting the president, and a criminal case was opened against him. By that time, he was studying in Poland, and he has not returned to Belarus since. In 2018, Svetlov switched his main activities from YouTube to Telegram, realising its potential to reach more people more easily.', 'As the summer’s election campaign wore on, Nexta’s popularity began to grow, partly because other bloggers who remained inside Belarus were harassed or thrown in jail. Sergei Tikhanovsky, who ran a YouTube channel and intended to stand for president, was arrested in May. In June, Igor Losik, administrator of the second biggest Belarusian Telegram channel, was also arrested. Both remain in jail. Tikhanovsky’s wife, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, eventually ran against Lukashenko as an opposition unity candidate. The dictator assumed she would give the election a veneer of legitimacy while posing no threat; but her promise to be a transitional leader ahead of new, fair elections began to energise a population desperate for change. Svetlov and his small team in Warsaw were quick to share videos from her rallies.', 'On 9 August, election day, Belarusian authorities turned off the internet almost completely as they announced the results – 80% for Lukashenko and 10% for Tikhanovskaya – to widespread disbelief and fury. After three nights of protests and ruthless police violence in response, the internet returned, a sign the authorities felt they had the situation back under control. But as detainees were freed and began to tell their stories, the Nexta team in Warsaw was deluged with horrific testimony and graphic footage of violence and injuries. I spoke to a western diplomat who told me that it is hard to overestimate Svetlov’s role in this summer’s protests, with most traditional opposition leaders jailed or forced into exile before the presidential vote: “I think he’s been the most important person of this entire period.”', 'Svetlov’s small team was overwhelmed by the volume of information coming from Belarus. “During the peak, there were about 200 messages coming every minute, or 100,000 a day. It was impossible to work through. We ignored text and just looked at photos and videos, and put the best on to the channel,” he recalls. As we speak, a young woman enters the office with a brusque, “Hi” and settles down for a shift at one of the computers, sifting through the thousands of messages, videos and tipoffs that Nexta receives each day. “You can’t talk to her, she’s still working anonymously,” Svetlov tells me, suggesting we continue our conversation in the kitchen.', 'I ask Svetlov about the Sunday I followed the crowds in Minsk, who in turn were following his directions. There were three people in the office that day, he says, tracking events in the Belarusian capital. There was no great science behind it: no complex software mapping the crowds, or algorithms to determine the numbers – simply three young people scrolling through hundreds of messages sent from the ground, and trying to determine which were the most relevant. Before major logistical information is put on the channel, it is debated in a small Telegram chat containing about 15 people, Svetlov tells me, including Nexta’s administrators and those from a few other channels.', '“We understood that people were by the war monument, and they needed to do something. Someone suggested they should go to the residence and everyone agreed, so we put it on the feed,” he says. And with that, a 22-year-old sitting in Warsaw moved a crowd of 100,000 people in Minsk.', 'None of this would have happened without Telegram’s creator, Pavel Durov. The reclusive 36-year-old Russian is ascetic in most lifestyle choices, arrogant in his interactions with others and quite brilliant at what he does. Born in St Petersburg, he learned coding in school, and immediately used it to subvert authority. According to a biography by the Russian journalist Nikolai Kononov, Durov hacked the system so that all the computers in the classroom displayed a photograph of the teacher and the caption “Must die”.', 'Later, as a student at St Petersburg State University, Durov set up a web forum for his fellow students. He did everything he could to promote it, organising real-life beauty contests that forum users could vote on, and creating controversial alter egos to ramp up controversy. “They were really juicy characters and people believed in them: an anti-feminist, a homophobe, a Stalinist,” he told Kononov. In much the same way that Mark Zuckerberg’s Harvard forum grew into Facebook, Durov and his brother Nikolai, who still work together today, turned their university website into VKontakte (meaning “in touch”). The Durovs were joined by a team of young coders, working out of the famous Singer House building in central St Petersburg, and the company grew rapidly in Russia and the former Soviet countries, partly because it also allowed users to share music and videos.', 'As VKontakte evolved into a tech giant, Durov gained a reputation as a strange, imperious figure. Obsessed with The Matrix, he saw himself, like Keanu Reeves’ character Neo, as a coder with a mission. He looks a little like a boyish Reeves, and in his rare public appearances is always dressed in black. He is a fan of grand gestures, such as a 2012 stunt in which he threw 5,000 rouble notes (then worth about £100) from the windows of Singer House and watched people scuffle on the street below.', 'But many artists were unhappy at VKontakte’s failure to take action against widespread copyright infringements on the site, and it was also slow to act on offensive material or groups, including those belonging to “Occupy Paedophilia”, an organisation that shared videos of attacks on LGBT people to its 90,000 followers on the site. Durov has a libertarian streak and has often said over the years that he values free speech above all, though to many, his unwillingness to take quick action over hate groups looked like an evasion of moral responsibility.', 'He also refused to bow to Kremlin pressure to ban opposition political groups, after protests broke out in Russia in late 2011. “This is my official answer to the security services,” he wrote on Twitter at the time, posting a photograph of a dog wearing a hoodie. As the informal relationship he had with figures around the Kremlin broke down, he was forced to sell his stake in an investment fund linked to pro-Kremlin oligarchs; and in the aftermath of the annexation of Crimea in 2014, he fled Russia, citing threats against him.', 'Durov acquired St Kitts and Nevis citizenship, and is now based in Dubai, spending long periods travelling the globe with his team of 15 or so coders in tow, often staying in hotels or rented houses. His precise movements are hard to track, and he ignored several interview requests for this article. (An associate of his tells me this is because “he has very high quality standards” and has met few journalists who lived up to them.) Instead, Durov communicates through a sporadically updated Telegram channel, where around once a month he drops his thoughts on freedom of speech, or the flaws of rival messenger services, particularly WhatsApp, which he loves to denigrate (“WhatsApp sucks”). Occasionally, the channel gives an insight into Durov’s lifestyle, such as a post last June in which he extolled the virtues of a “seagan” diet of wild fish and nothing else. He drinks no alcohol or caffeine, and claims not to have taken any pills or medicine for the past 15 years. In an October post marking his 36th birthday, he shared tips on how to stay looking young (you should live alone, for a start).', 'Since leaving Russia, Durov has focused on Telegram, the app he began developing as a way to speak securely with his brother and other associates. He has portrayed Telegram as a labour of love; it carries no advertising, and he says he has so far funded it himself, from the vast profits he made from VKontakte. A plan to launch a cryptocurrency called TON, which would have been integrated into Telegram, faltered earlier this year after the US Securities and Exchange Commission ordered the cash to be returned to investors.', 'One of the chief reasons Telegram is so beloved of protest movements is that it will run even if national regulators ban it. Used in conjunction with another app called Psiphon, it can circumvent most firewalls. Protesters in Iran used this approach to get around a government ban on Telegram in early 2018. But this loophole makes it just as useful for drug dealers, terrorists and other criminals. In Britain and many other places, one of the primary uses of Telegram is for buying drugs. In India, authorities have found Telegram has become a leading source of pirated music and film streams. Most notoriously, it also became known as the Isis app of choice. Former former prime minister Theresa May singled out Telegram in 2018 when she warned about “smaller platforms” that “can quickly become home to criminals and terrorists”.', 'According to Joshua Fisher-Birch, a researcher at the Counter Extremism Project in New York, Telegram was the forum Isis fighters used most often to communicate with each other at the height of the group’s dominance of parts of Iraq and Syria. “They felt it was a safe space, because they would not have their data shared with any government, and they also liked the ease of use,” he tells me. Durov’s explanations for why he does not lose sleep over this have been far from convincing: “Ultimately, Isis will always find a way to communicate within themselves, and if any means of communication turns out to be not secure, they’ll just switch to another one,” he said at a conference in 2015.', 'But, despite its initial reluctance to work with governments, Telegram has started taking action against terrorist-linked channels, Fisher-Birch says. In November last year, thousands of chats, bots and channels with Isis links were removed, in a joint operation with Europol, who said Telegram had gone to “considerable effort” to identify and remove Isis-linked content.', 'Earlier this year I spoke, via Telegram audio, to the administrator of a number of channels covering the Hong Kong protests, including one with more than 100,000 subscribers. Anticipating what would happen in Belarus, he told me that the organisers used channels for disseminating timely information to protesters, and the group chats for discussing their next steps. He particularly appreciated a Telegram feature that allows one user to delete a chat for both themselves and the other party, and had used it when friends had been arrested, in case police gained access to their phones.', 'He also liked the way people could be mobilised very quickly. “A big Telegram moment was at the Polytechnic University [in Hong Kong] last November, when a lot of students were trapped inside and the police were trying to attack. We used the channels to get as many people there as possible to help save them from arrest,” he told me. Although he was sure that some of the chats were infiltrated by police informants, a feature allowing users to hide their telephone numbers meant he felt more protected than on WhatsApp or other messengers. “With Telegram, we are pretty sure that we can’t be monitored by the government,” he said.', 'In Belarus, it is not just the tech-savvy youth who rely on the app. I realised this at the end of a reporting day in the provinces, when I stopped the car in a small village about an hour from Minsk, and got chatting to a 72-year-old woman who lives alone in a neat cottage. A former manager at one of Belarus’s many Soviet-built, state-run factories, Valentina is exactly the kind of person one might have expected to support Lukashenko – and she told me that until a few years ago she had, appreciating the way he had steered the country through the 90s without allowing the oligarchy and inequality that developed in neighbouring Russia and Ukraine to take hold. “If he had left 10 years ago, he would have gone down as a hero, but he has started to treat the people as though they are trash,” she said as we drank tea made from leaves she had foraged herself.', 'The transformation in Valentina’s political views began when she stopped watching state news on television and started using Telegram, which one of her grandchildren had installed for her on the chunky desktop computer in her bedroom. Now, each night before bed, she draws the orange curtains in the spotlessly tidy room and settles into an armchair at her computer desk to scroll through her Telegram feed. “It’s very addictive! I think, I’ll just take a look for half an hour, and before I know it, it’s nearly three in the morning. Which is a disaster as I have to wake up early to tend the allotment.” Almost all her friends are on Telegram, too, usually with the help of their children or grandchildren.', 'Meanwhile, the standoff in Belarus appears to have reached something of a stalemate: the Sunday protests continue, but Lukashenko remains reluctant to make concessions. A whole network of smaller Telegram chats and channels, coordinating protest in various cities, streets or even specific apartment blocks, has now appeared, creating a localised and fragmented protest movement that authorities cannot possibly crush.', 'Back in Warsaw, I ask Svetlov what comes next for Nexta. The evening before we meet, the channel had published the home address of a pro-Lukashenko official. Wasn’t this an incitement to violence? “That was not meant to exert physical pressure on him – it was more for psychological effect, so that people start thinking about their actions. We see the same thing with policemen who are scared to show their faces and hide behind masks,” he says. In the weeks after our meeting, Nexta releases the names and dates of birth of thousands of policemen, having been sent a leaked list.', 'Will Svetlov feel a sense of responsibility if the protests turn violent, given the volume of his followers? What if something happens to the people he outs on Nexta? He shrugs, with his usual half-smile, and dodges the question. “From the beginning, we saw it as a peaceful protest. It was the authorities who started the repression.”', 'As Lukashenko’s legitimacy has crumbled, he has increasingly looked to Vladimir Putin for support. While the Russian president has little affection for Lukashenko, he has even less for street protest. In the Kremlin, there has been horror at how quickly discontent has flared in a neighbouring country that appeared to be stable. Russian authorities banned the app in 2018, after Durov refused to comply with their demand that Telegram should share encryption data with the security services on request. But after two years in which millions of Russians got round the ban by using their own VPN, this June the Kremlin gave up and legalised Telegram again.', 'Still, events in Belarus show that even in the harshest of crackdowns, neutralising Telegram as a mobilising force is close to impossible. Lukashenko recently warned Putin that he, too, should be wary of Telegram: “You’re a powerful country, a nuclear country. But the Soviet Union was also a nuclear country. So you can’t relax… Through the internet, through these Telegram channels, they will get so deep into people’s brains.” The words were clearly meant to pressure Putin into continuing to prop him up, but Lukashenko might have a point – that the app, created by an exiled Russian, could one day play a similar role in Russia.', 'Recently, Svetlov inserted a poll into the Nexta Live channel to ask followers where they were based. Out of more than 700,000 respondents, over half were in Belarus, but 28% were in Russia. “When things quieten down in Belarus, we need to start reaching that Russian audience, too,” Svetlov says, smiling. “We won’t call for people to protest. But if they start, we’ll certainly cover it.”']",['Shaun Walker'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a4707fb3b7c35984bef7c046aec517c5ca801b6/0_284_2392_1434/master/2392.jpg?width=480&dpr=1&s=none', 'Telegram allows huge encrypted chat groups.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd9322e746a47d24100c2b2f411348d3676aa312/0_313_5941_3565/master/5941.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Stepan Svetlov, creator of the Nexta channel.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4d4e8bb71cbe14c70db89cc2565d712410e3f9e/0_325_8510_5107/master/8510.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Pavel Durov, founder of Telegram.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/203b8d369133590d2a81d3cbe894826317de0fda/87_451_4562_2736/master/4562.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Protests in Minsk.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fefd247b5b91ef478cc9a497d08fc53fb5558b2a/0_218_3302_1982/master/3302.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Belarus president Alexander Lukashenko (second left) in Minsk.']]",

The new data also revealed Indigenous Australians of all ages continue to be disproportionately subjected to strip searches by police.', 'The proportion of searches carried out on Indigenous Australians of all ages rose from 9% to 13% between 2018-19 and 2019-20.

In Liverpool in the city’s west, it was 10%.', '“Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should not have to live in fear of being strip searched by police. This harmful practice is eroding good community relations and feeds into distrust and fear of the police,” Lee said.', 'Police in NSW have been repeatedly criticised over the use of strip searches. Earlier this year, the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission released two separate tranches of investigations into individual searches which were found to have been unlawful.', 'The reports followed a lengthy public inquiry into the use of the policing tactic, which heard evidence of a number of potentially illegal strip searches. Among them include a 16-year-old girl who was left fearful and in tears after she was forced to strip naked in front of police at the Splendour in the Grass Festival in Byron Bay.', 'In a statement, a NSW police spokeswoman said the force would take a “considered approach” when the final report from that investigation is released later this year, and pointed to the overall reduction in strip searches and a year-on-year decline in the number of searches of children from 175 to 96.', '“A number of changes to policies, processes and training – including a new Person Search Manual, updated verification and auditing processes, and music festival procedures – have already been implemented, which have all been subject to monitoring by LECC,” the spokeswoman said.', 'The spokeswoman also defended the seven searches conducted on children aged between 11 and 14, saying they had been “reviewed and deemed to comply with policy and legislative requirements”.', 'But Vicki Sentas, a lecturer at the University of NSW – who last year co-authored a report which found that the use of drug dogs was helping to fuel massive increases in strip-searches – said the “differential policing” of Indigenous Australians revealed by the figures showed the need to reform the often-criticised legislation governing strip search powers.', '“Police leadership appear to have responded to the public backlash against strip searches by sending the message for police to ease off on music festivals,” she said.', '“None of the changes to police policy and training on strip searches have made a difference for how First Nations people are being policed and it’s only getting worse.

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/19/teacher-talk-about-racism-government-meddling-white-privilege-victim-narratives,"['With ‘white privilege’ and ‘victim narratives’ in the government’s crosshairs, we are worried about how to do our jobs', 'In October, the women and equalities minister Kemi Badenoch made a dramatic intervention in the House of Commons during a session commemorating Black History Month. Schools, she said, that teach students about certain ideas from “critical race theory” as “fact” were breaking the law: “We do not want teachers to teach their white pupils about white privilege and inherited racial guilt.”', 'The minister’s words came not too long after guidance for schools in England was published that said schools “should not use resources produced by organisations that … promote victim narratives that are harmful to British society”. It’s safe to say that these two developments, which seemed designed to have a chilling effect on discussing the uncomfortable truths of racism in Britain, have made fellow teachers and myself worried about what we can and can’t say. And the day after Badenoch’s speech, I was due to take a PSHE (personal, social, health and economic) lesson about racism.', 'Most of the students in my class are white, so before we even started the lesson, I knew that the racial status of whiteness in a white-majority society was going to come up. I felt unsure as to my role – I hadn’t had time yet to absorb Badenoch’s statement – but the intelligence and inquisitiveness of my students led the way. “Can you be racist towards white people, because I told my friend that you can’t?”, asked one. Others began sharing their experiences. A black student talked about how their family members had been stopped by the police in town. Two non-white students explained how a teacher got them mixed up for a year. There was no point during the lesson when any of the white students shared experiences of racism. Isn’t that discrepancy in their experiences an example of “white privilege” in action?', 'Schools are complex ecosystems. You might be dealing with more than 1,000 students and several hundred staff members. It became evident to me that there were many members of staff who didn’t know or maybe even care about the issues raised during Black History Month. I know that one member of staff said, “All lives matter” at one point, while another drew a false equivalence between Black Lives Matter and the BNP. This highlights both the importance of educating staff about race, as well as the fact that schools are contested spaces for social issues.', 'Now we are faced with the dilemma of how to teach vitally important concepts without breaking government guidance. Colleagues often have the same worrying scenario in mind: they try to have a nuanced conversation about “whiteness” or the legacy of white supremacy, and a student goes home and tells their parents that they’re learning about how racism is their fault. The government says it is against teaching certain ideas, as if they were “accepted facts”. But no concept in the social sciences is uncontested and surely Badenoch knows this, so the real consequences of her words is probably going to be a chilling effect.

Some were at the end of long journeys, and more than a dozen aircraft were soon dangerously low on fuel.', 'About an hour after the first sighting, Eddie Mitchell, a news photographer, was on his way to the airport to cover the shutdown when he remembered that he had two drones in his car. Fearing that he might come under suspicion, he rang the police: “I said: ‘I’m heading to Gatwick, please don’t think it’s me!’” Mitchell is licensed by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to fly drones commercially, sometimes in his capacity as a cameraman, sometimes for official bodies such as the fire brigade. But he had good reason to be cautious. Four years earlier, in December 2014, he was trying to get aerial footage of a fire close to Gatwick when police arrested him. His drone was confiscated and he was held for five hours. (He later won compensation for wrongful arrest.)', 'By midnight, 58 flights had been diverted or cancelled. But there hadn’t been any drone sightings for an hour, and Gatwick tried to reopen the runway. And then, suddenly, the drones reappeared. “We had the feeling that it was going to last all night,” I was told by a former Gatwick employee who did not want to give her name. She was right: into the next day, every time staff prepared to reopen the runway, more sightings were reported. Staff and police speculated that the drone operator had gained access to the flight radar system, or was somehow listening into police or airport communications.', 'Some feared the drones were being operated by terrorists. “Drones can be transformed into flying suicide vests,” said David Dunn, a drone expert at Birmingham University. In the previous two years, there had been multiple terror attacks around Europe, including the suicide bombing at the Manchester Arena 18 months earlier, which killed 22 people. It had been reported that Isis had used consumer drones to drop grenades in Iraq. After the failed attempt at reopening, Sussex police alerted the Metropolitan police’s counter-terrorism unit. “We were under siege,” the former employee told me. The drones seemed to be taunting them. “It started to feel like a national emergency.”', 'By about 9.30 the following morning, Sussex police had called in officers from five other police forces to help with the search. A helicopter and several police drones went up to search for rogue drones – to no avail. At 10.20am, police told reporters that although this was a “deliberate act to disrupt the airport”, there was “absolutely no indication to suggest this is terror-related”. There was speculation that it could be an environmental protest, or even an “inside job” – sabotage by a disgruntled ex-employee. Whoever it was, the impact on Gatwick – Britain’s second-biggest airport, with 46 million people passing through each year – was seismic. Later that day, Gatwick CEO Stewart Wingate said that the drone flights were “highly targeted” and had “been designed to close the airport and bring maximum disruption in the run up to Christmas”.', 'Mitchell, the photographer, was observing all this. “It was panic stations,” he told me. Although the atmosphere in the airport was frenetic, for the photographers – Mitchell remembers there being about 30 of them – it was a long and boring day. None of them caught sight of any drones, and Mitchell was beginning to doubt whether there was one.', 'At about 5pm, Mitchell was parked at the end of the runway with a colleague when something caught his eye: a red and green light, hovering in the distance. This was it. He reported the drone to police, before jumping out of the car to start snapping. “I thought, we’ve got it, and the idiot flying it,” he said. “That was the money shot.”', 'But when he opened up the image on his computer, ready to send to his editors, he realised he’d made a mistake. The image did not show a drone. It was a helicopter hovering 10 miles away; between the darkness and the distance, his eyes had played a trick on him. “If I’m making a mistake – and I fly drones two or three times a week – then God help us, because others will have no idea,” he said. He called police to retract his reported sighting.', 'At 6pm, military trucks arrived at Gatwick with an anti-drone system designed for battlefield operation, and installed it on the roof of the south terminal. This system can track and disable drones; it works by jamming the radio frequency connecting the drone to its controller. At 9.30pm, Gatwick’s chief operating officer Chris Woodroofe announced that the airport would remain closed overnight because of new drone sightings. The military system was operational by around 10pm. It did not pick up a single thing.', 'In the early hours of Friday 21 December, the runway reopened for the 10th time. At 5.58am, a plane from East Midlands airport landed at Gatwick. The drone incident was over.', 'The airport had been closed for 33 hours. More than 1,000 flights had been cancelled, and more than 140,000 passengers affected. “It showed the serious risk of drone intrusion, and how quickly that could bring an airport to its knees,” said John Strickland, an aviation consultant. In total, 170 drone sightings were reported, 115 of which were later deemed “credible” by police. But neither Mitchell, nor any of the news crews camped out for two days, had managed to get a photo or video. Neither had any of the thousands of passengers and airport staff on site; no one who reported a sighting had captured an image on their phone.', 'The Gatwick incident was the first time a major airport was shut down by drones, and it distilled deep cultural anxieties – from the threat of terrorism and unconventional attacks by hostile states, to our fear of new technology. Two years later, it remains unsolved, despite a police operation that lasted 18 months, cost £800,000 and involved five different forces. Conspiracy theories abound online: people claim that the incident was a setup by companies selling counter-drone systems to market their products, that it was a coverup for a cyber-attack on the airport, or that it was staged to bring down the share price ahead of a Gatwick share sale (a week after the drone incident, a majority stake was sold to a French airport group).', 'Despite lack of evidence – or indeed any leads or convincing motives – Sussex police and Gatwick maintain it was a sophisticated, malicious and well-planned attack. On social media, meanwhile, the Gatwick drone has become a punchline, with many casting doubts on its very existence.', 'Richard Ryan knows more about drones than most – he is a barrister specialising in drone law at Blakiston’s Chambers, as well as being a registered commercial drone operator. At the time of the Gatwick incident, he lived in Horley, just a mile away from the airport. When he heard the news, his first thought was: “It was only a matter of time.” Despite his enthusiasm about the transformative possibilities of drones, he had long worried that someone might put them to sinister use.', 'A day or two after the airport reopened, Sussex police asked Ryan to come in for an interview. Ryan quickly established that they were not interested in his professional expertise: they wanted to ascertain whether he had been involved. “I told them that, upon consideration, I don’t think it’s a valuable use of our time, because simply put, it wasn’t me,” he recalled. “I’ve previously worked for the UAS Unit at the Civil Aviation Authority. I’m qualified and responsible in terms of my drone use.” The next day, police put a note through his letterbox saying they had visited.', 'He was not the only local resident to receive police attention. At about 10pm on 21 December, 12 armed police officers stormed a house in Crawley, a few miles from the airport, and arrested married couple Paul Gait and Elaine Kirk on suspicion of “disrupting services of civil aviation aerodrome to endanger or likely to endanger safety of operations or persons”. Gait, an ex-soldier and window fitter, was a model aircraft enthusiast. Their names leaked to the press. The Daily Mail’s front page the next day splashed on the story, with a photo of the couple next to the headline: “Are these the morons who ruined Christmas?”', 'They were not, it turned out, the morons who ruined Christmas. During the 36 hours they were held at the police station, it was established that they had been at work while the drones were flying, and despite Gait’s collection of remote-controlled helicopters, they didn’t own a drone. (Kirk’s ex-husband told the Mirror that it was unlikely she was involved because “she hates toy aircraft”.) They were released without charge. Gait delivered a tearful statement to the hordes of reporters outside their home: “As you can probably imagine, we are feeling completely violated. Our home has been searched and our privacy and identity completely exposed.”', 'While Gait and Kirk were in police custody, there seemed to be another breakthrough in the case when a member of the public found a damaged drone in Horley, near Gatwick’s perimeter fence. A forensics team looked for fingerprints, and digital data that could show where it had flown to and from. But on analysing this data, police ruled out its involvement.', 'The Gatwick drone incident led news broadcasts and front pages for days. It had cost airlines around £50m, and there were fears that it could spark copycat attacks if the culprit wasn’t found. That weekend, the Sunday Times ran a story warning that terrorist groups were planning to attack airports using drones.', 'As the days passed and no one claimed responsibility, the theory that environmental activists were to blame seemed less and less likely. But the investigation appeared to be floundering. In the weeks after the incident, police visited Simon Dale, who runs a drone retail and repair shop, to gather background information about drones that might help their investigation. “The parameters they were describing didn’t make sense,” he told me. “[The drone] was apparently flying in and out of buildings close to terminal buildings, almost taunting the tower by one account, which would be very hard to do. They said you’d have to have intimate knowledge of the buildings, so the idea someone was tens of miles away doesn’t add up. They were asking us if it could be controlled over 3G. It seemed quite far-fetched.”', 'Military drones such as the Reaper or the Predator are capable of flying hundreds of kilometres and staying in the air for more than 24 hours at a stretch. But most drones do not have anything approaching this capability: they vary in size, but most are, even with their arms extended, no bigger than a laptop. They struggle to fly in wind or rain, and have limited battery life. Top-tier consumer drones can travel for up to five miles, but have a maximum flight time of about 30 minutes. Custom-built drones might manage up to a couple of hours, but not much more: larger batteries add weight, which uses up more battery. “If someone were flying drones for hours, they’d need a carload of batteries,” Ryan told me.', 'On 23 December, a few days after the incident, DCS Jason Tingley of Sussex police publicly expressed what many were thinking when he said: “We are working with human beings saying they have seen something.” Gatwick is one of the most heavily monitored patches of land in the UK, but no hard evidence had been found. Tingley admitted that there was “always a possibility that there may not have been any genuine drone activity in the first place”.', 'This did not go down well. The following day, Sussex police released a statement reiterating that sightings remained at the forefront of their investigation. On 29 December, Giles York, the Sussex police chief constable, went on the BBC’s Today programme, saying he was “absolutely certain a drone was flying throughout the period the airport was closed”. He told presenters that 115 sightings had been corroborated, and that 92 of these had come from “credible” people. But he inadvertently muddied the water further, saying: “Of course, we will have launched our own Sussex police drones at the time with a view to investigate, with a view to engage, with a view to survey the area looking for the drone, so there could be some level of confusion there.”', 'Strangely, despite the lack of evidence, the possibility that this might have been a case of human error does not appear to have been entertained for long. Through Crimestoppers, Gatwick offered a £50,000 reward for anyone with information. The investigation marched on.', 'Drone enthusiast Ian Hudson started filing freedom of information requests (FOIs) in the first half of 2018, seven months before the Gatwick incident. His first few were aimed at local police forces near his home in Yorkshire. How many times had a drone been reported for flying near a school? Or taking contraband into prisons? Had there been prosecutions?', 'Hudson wanted hard data to counteract what he saw as scare stories about drones. Alongside his day job in IT, Hudson runs a popular drone-related Twitter account, @UAVHive, and is part of Britain’s close-knit community of drone hobbyists, who gather on message boards to swap opinions about the latest tech and share photos taken from great heights. Hudson is sceptical of overblown fears about new technology. Back when mobile phones were becoming popular, Hudson worked in customer service for BT. “I was on the receiving end of worries about how they can burn your brain,” he told me. “I think people fear drones because they’re new.”', 'On a cold day in September, I stood in a field outside Bradford with Hudson and a group of five local drone flyers. They were all men, mostly in their 30s or 40s, and had got to know each other via hobbyist Facebook groups. They handled their drones with immense care, joking that the machines might be blown away for ever in such high winds. In the presence of a drone, the first thing you notice is the sound – a deep, mechanical thrum as its small, helicopter-like blades spin to propel it into the air. One man, a commercial operator who uses drones for roof inspections, had brought along goggles that allow you to see through the drone’s camera. I put them on, and as the drone took wobbly flight, I was transported over the hills and valleys that lay beyond.', 'A few years ago, a T-shirt became popular among Britain’s drone flyers. “Before you ask”, it says. “It’s a drone. Yes, it was expensive. Yes, it has a camera. About 25 minutes. Over a mile away. No, you can’t fly it.” Since the Gatwick incident, the men told me, people who see them flying drones are often more hostile than before. I heard several drone flyers repeat some variation of a new saying: “Gatwick drone? There’s more evidence for the Loch Ness monster.”', 'Civilian use of drones is expanding all the time, as technology improves and costs fall. Back in the 60s, remote-controlled model aircraft became available to consumers, thanks to breakthroughs in transistor technology, and an enthusiastic community sprang up, similar to that surrounding drones today. The CAA estimates that there are currently about 130,000 drone flyers in the UK, operating drones ranging from flimsy toys that sell for £50, up to much more sophisticated machines costing £1,000 or more.', 'Drones were developed as weapons. Their usage in war hugely increased after 2001, when the US deployed them in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their association with warfare gives them a sinister edge in the popular imagination, as does the hornet-like buzzing sound they make in flight. There are concerns about their potential use in smuggling drugs or weapons; and the risks to privacy posed by flying cameras. In October 2018, seven men were jailed after using drones to fly £550,000 worth of drugs into prisons in the Midlands and the north-west. In Donbas, Russian-backed separatists have weaponised consumer drones to drop grenades on Ukrainian government trenches.', 'With his FOIs, Hudson aimed to show that such incidents are rare. His urge to dispel fears about drones comes from a deep enthusiasm about the possibilities that they offer. Drones can deliver medicine to hard-to-reach areas and survey fires to aid rescue missions. They have mundane uses, too; in roof inspections, they save the cost of scaffolding or the risk of climbing a very tall ladder, in the oil and gas industry they are used for remote monitoring of platforms and oil spills. As far back as 2013, Jeff Bezos floated the idea of drone-based Amazon deliveries.', 'The men at the drone meetup near Bradford were mostly interested in photography – they showed me aerial shots of the ocean and spectacular landscapes. “I’d just never get to see this perspective without a drone,” one man told me, a sense of wonder in his voice. Drone enthusiasts speak scathingly of rulebreakers: this is a self-policing community. They worry that misuse will lead to more regulation, which will hamper their activity. “If someone is doing mischief, which you’ll find on YouTube or whatever, people immediately report them to the police and the CAA,” said Hudson. “There’s no tolerance of people being daft with drones – there’ll be laws made and it’ll affect everyone who has one.”', 'When Hudson first heard about Gatwick, “I thought this was some absolute idiot and I wanted them caught.” But then he realised “the basic facts don’t add up”. Sussex police had mentioned lights in the corroborated sightings. But if someone had planned the attack, to the extent that they had procured scores of batteries and hacked the drone’s in-built geofencing software – which uses GPS to stop drones from flying into restricted zones such as airports or prisons – then why would they leave the lights on? “You’d disable them,” said Hudson.', 'Hudson looked at publicly available information: photographs taken during the incident, and statements by Sussex police. Since then, he has identified inconsistencies that he believes undermine the claim that there were drones at Gatwick. Soon after we first spoke, Hudson sent me a long email, including a timeline of tweets and photographs posted during the incident, highlighting contradictions. (“Did he send you four A4 pages with closely typed text and diagrams?” another drone-flyer joked. “It’s one of Ian’s pet subjects.”) The photos he included showed military counter-drone systems being set up on 20 December, the second day of the shutdown – and tweets by Sussex police mentioning sightings after this point, right into the early hours of 21 December. This included one cluster by “credible” witnesses – airport staff and police officers.', 'After it was set up, the military system should have picked up any drone activity – but nothing was recorded. Hudson wanted answers: “I want to be able to say: ‘Wait a minute, these credible witnesses aren’t all credible.’”', 'In July 2019, about six months after the incident, Hudson filed his first FoI to Sussex police: “Can you confirm the date and time of the final sighting of the December 2018 drone at Gatwick?” Under the Freedom of Information Act, public bodies have to respond within 20 working days. Often this is refused, on grounds of national security or the time it will take to find the information. But Sussex police did not even send a refusal.', 'Gary Mortimer, editor of the popular drone site sUAS News, and a general enthusiast for flying objects (at different points, he has been a hot air balloon pilot and a member of the air force), joined Hudson in filing FoI requests. Apart from a response to a simple question about the cost of the investigation, their requests were almost always ignored or rebuffed. Ryan, the barrister, filed an FoI of his own with Sussex police. It included 14 questions. “I wanted to understand: how on earth did I get on their list?” he told me. These, too, went unanswered, and remain so today.', 'Soon after the incident, Mortimer had published a blog post questioning whether the supposed drone might have been “a cover for some other operation”. But he also wondered if the real explanation might be more mundane. “One option is that something that wasn’t a drone was reported, and then the next day, police flew their aircraft there and people saw that,” he said to me. “Then it’s Chicken Little and the sky falling in.”', 'In the months following the Gatwick incident, there was a flurry of alleged drone sightings at airports around the world – though each only resulted in shutdowns of an hour or so. In January 2019, it was Heathrow, and Newark in the US; in February 2019, Dubai. Anxiety about malicious uses of drones intensified in September 2019, when a splinter group of Extinction Rebellion announced plans to shut down Heathrow by flying drones on the runway. The organisers were arrested and no drones were flown. Soon afterwards, the retailer John Lewis said it would stop selling drones due to the risk of misuse. “It feels like people are turning against drones, even though most flyers just want to photograph nice landscapes,” one hobbyist told me.', 'Before the Gatwick incident, there were already calls for the government to address the potential threat of drone misuse; the British Airline Pilots Association was one prominent voice. In January 2019, parliament published the results of a major drone consultation and brought in more regulation, including compulsory registration for drones over a certain weight, and greater police powers to land and seize them. This had been under way before Gatwick, but the incident focused political attention. In the weeks that followed, Gatwick and Heathrow spent £5m on counter-drone systems. A more far-reaching drones bill is on its way through parliament.', 'In theory, it should be fairly easy to assess how often drones get close to planes, but in fact, this is disputed. When two aircraft come too close to each other, the incident is known as an “airprox”. Pilots or air traffic controllers report such incidents to the UK Airprox Board, which exists to enhance air safety by reporting “the circumstances, causes and risks of collision” in UK airspace. It recorded 280 such events in 2017, 40% of which related to drones. The overall number of reported incidents has increased by a third since 2016.', 'In late 2018, Simon Dale, the drone retailer, set up a website called Airprox Reality Check, where he digs into the data for drone sightings reported to the board, assessing what else might have been in the area. “More often than not, it’s a full-sized helicopter,” he said.', 'In the US, the Federal Aviation Authority said it gets more than 100 reports every month from citizens who believe they’ve seen a drone near a plane or an airport. Back in 2015, the Academy of Model Aeronautics analysed these sightings and found that just 3.5% actually involved a near-miss between aircraft and a drone.', 'Sussex police and Gatwick Airport both firmly stuck to the line that the December 2018 drone sightings were credible, since they were reported by police officers and airport employees who knew what they were seeing. “We can all accept that some of the sightings were wrong – that’s obvious,” said the former Gatwick employee who did not want to be named. “But these were colleagues who had been working at airports for 20, 30 years, and knew how serious it was.”', 'Back in the 60s, Percy Walker, the director of Britain’s Ministry of Aviation accident inspection branch, said that eyewitnesses to aviation accidents are “almost always wrong”. Subsequent academic studies support the notion that it is difficult for the human eye to accurately assess fast-moving, distant objects. If people often think they have seen a drone when they have, in fact, seen something else, then what else could have happened at Gatwick?', 'In April 1954, a strange phenomenon swept across the town of Bellingham, Seattle, and other communities in Washington state. People began to observe “windshield pits” on their cars – minor damage that, when magnified, can look like a tiny crater in the surface of the glass, usually caused by sand or other small debris colliding with the windscreen at high speed. As the phenomenon was reported in the press, more people noticed marks and chips on their screens. A few weeks before the sightings began, the US had exploded a huge hydrogen bomb in the Pacific Ocean, and many blamed these nuclear tests. Others believed a nearby navy communication tower was warping the glass. Residents panicked. By 15 April, almost 3,000 windscreens had been affected, and the mayor asked for assistance from President Eisenhower.', 'Today, the Seattle windshield pitting epidemic is often cited as an example of mass panic, in which people attributed a sinister cause to something that had been there, unnoticed, all along. Two days after the appeal to the president, Seattle police issued a statement saying that the pitting epidemic was “95% public hysteria”. Sightings suddenly stopped.', 'This kind of mass panic has been documented throughout history, and all over the world. More recently, the “Croydon cat killer” was alleged to have brutally murdered hundreds of cats in and around London, leaving the bodies, in the words of one journalist, “in places children are sure to find them”. The alarm was raised by a cat shelter, and reports in the local press were picked up nationally and then internationally – despite the fact that there was no discernible pattern, or evidence of human involvement. As the story gained prominence, more people reported cat murders: ultimately, more than 500 were called in. But after an investigation spanning several years, in September 2018, the Metropolitan police concluded that the cats had been hit by cars or eaten by foxes.', 'Is it possible that something similar happened at Gatwick? “In a state of anxiety, we often focus attention on innocuous stimuli,” said Gary Small, professor of psychiatry at UCLA and an expert in mass hysteria. “There’s a lot of anxiety about terrorism. There’s a lot of anxiety about drones.”', 'In the year that followed the Gatwick drone incident, police knocked on 1,200 doors, took 222 witness statements and identified 96 persons of interest. But on 27 September 2019, Sussex police formally closed the investigation, saying that “without new information coming to light, there are no further realistic lines of inquiry”. The force said that the incident was not terror-related, and that there was “no evidence to suggest it was either state sponsored, campaign or interest-group led”. The force cited “corroborated witness statements” in its conclusion that at least two drones were in operation through this period, and that it was a “serious and deliberate criminal act designed to endanger airport operations and the safety of the travelling public”.', 'In June 2020, Sussex police settled out of court with Paul Gait and Elaine Kirk, agreeing to award the couple £200,000 in damages and legal fees for their wrongful arrest. No one else has been charged over the drone incident, and the couple’s legal team said that “serious doubts remain as to whether there were, in fact, any drones flown over the airport”.', 'In public, the airport and police stuck firm to the idea that there was definitely a drone incursion. But privately, some have doubts. “We work on evidence, and I haven’t seen any. That’s really all there is to say,” one police officer with knowledge of the case told me.', 'Still, many people remain convinced. Dunn, the professor at Birmingham University who studies the security risks posed by drones, said “there is a circuit of people interested in this topic”, referring to drone researchers and airport personnel, “and they’re fairly categoric that while the later sightings may have been a crane, initially there were absolutely drones”.', 'At the time, there was no clear guidance on what an airport should do in the event of a drone incursion, accidental or hostile, so closing the airport was a reasonable decision. “It’s not an industry that can take a flippant view about any threat to safety, and there can be a high price for that,” said John Strickland, the aviation consultant.', '“Pre-Gatwick, it was like the blind leading the blind, because nobody really knew what to do. But since Gatwick, a lot of bright people have focused on how to solve this problem,” says Richard Gill, CEO of Drone Defence, a security consultancy that provides counter-drone technology to governments and big corporations. This view is shared across the industry. “While we may never know what really happened at Gatwick,” says Adam Lisberg, the corporate communications director at drone manufacturer DJI, “it was the event that forced the aviation and drone industries around the world to find solutions so that a single drone sighting doesn’t close down an airport.”', 'Few people disapprove of improving systems for keeping airports safe, but hobbyists feel that suspicion is being cast on anyone who flies a drone at all. In Bradford, one man told me he had sold his drone – it was too difficult to find areas where flying was permitted. Even Ian Hudson told me that he barely flies his drones any more. “It’s just too much hassle,” he said.', 'But drones remain a passion – and he is persevering with his FOIs. He recently got a tranche of heavily redacted emails from the Department for Transport, showing discussion of counter-drone systems in the days that followed the incident, but nothing directly related to the investigation. Sussex police, in particular, have been remarkably unresponsive. “There’s been no explanation, and it just comes across as people covering arses,” Hudson said. “I want to get to the truth.”', 'Most people with any interest in the Gatwick drone have already made their mind up. Either the initial sighting was a mistake, and subsequent sightings were the result of mass panic or confirmation bias, as proved by the technical unfeasibility of what was described. Or there was a drone, and the same technical challenges are evidence that it was an extremely sophisticated attack, one that we should be wary of dismissing.', '“I cannot rule out the capabilities of a mystery drone, but the more seemingly magical powers ascribed to it, the more sceptical you become,” said Lisberg. “Every time a bit of information challenges the initial version, it seems to confirm how sneaky it really was.

In February this year, in a separate report, the former commissioner Michael Adams QC wrote he was “concerned” that a number of “key policy positions” in the manual were “wrong at law”.', 'In its final report, the watchdog declined to say whether the practice is legal or not. Instead it has called on the parliament to “clarify” laws saying until it does “the lawfulness of this practice remains debatable”.', '“The lack of clarity in relation to these issues makes it difficult for police and for oversight bodies to decide with certainty whether it is lawful for an officer to ask a person to do these things, and use force if that request is refused,” the report says.', '“This is not a satisfactory situation given how intrusive and often traumatic strip-searches are for the person searched. Given how common these practices are, this ambiguity should be resolved.”', 'A continuing theme in the LECC’s investigation has been a lack of understanding among police about their powers under the law, and the report detailed a number of attempts made by the NSW Police to educate officers on the law.', 'In October last year, police sent a state-wide message to officers reminding them of the prohibition on strip-searching a child under the age of 10 including “looking into or removing nappies”, the report stated.', 'Responding to the release of the report on Tuesday, NSW police said it had made “significant changes” to its policies regarding strip-searches since the inquiry began.', '“This program of reform has already seen real change: since 2016, the percentage of strip-searches conducted in the field resulting in a find has risen from 33% to 46%,” a spokesperson said. “The findings are now being reviewed by the NSW police force executive who will take a considered approach to further reform in this area.”', 'Greens MP David Shoebridge said Tuesday’s report showed parliament needed to act to change the laws around strip-searches.', '“The LECC inquiry has uncovered routine and criminal lawbreaking by the police in how and when they undertake strip-searches and who they search,” he said.', '“Police have been on notice about the problems with their strip-search regime for well over a decade yet unlawful searches have continued. It’s time for parliament to step in and end that. This report shows very clearly the urgent and necessary need to change the law relating to searches and strip searches to protect both police and the public.”', 'The LECC’s reports into strip searches have routinely detailed cases of officers conducting unlawful searches, often on minors. In one case investigated by the commission in March 2018 and revealed in Tuesday’s report, two officers in a regional town stopped a Aboriginal boy who had been riding a motorbike without a helmet.', 'After the boy tried to flee from officers, they “chased and arrested” him, “by applying force, including knee strikes to the lower half of his body, and placed him in the rear pod of the police vehicle, which was parked on a major highway”.', '“The young person was made to remove all of his clothes, lift his genitals and pull the cheeks of his buttocks apart,” the LECC report stated.', '“Nothing adverse was found on the young person as a result of the search. When the officers decided to arrest the young person, they did not know that the motorbike had been stolen and therefore decided to pursue, chase, arrest and strip-search the young person because he was riding a motorbike without a helmet.”', 'In NSW, police are permitted to carry out field strip-searches only if the urgency and seriousness of the situation requires it. In the case of minors, a parent, guardian or support person must be present during the search unless it’s necessary for the safety of the person or to prevent evidence being destroyed.']",['Michael McGowan'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec37484361bb65da30f937ffcc851892f3bad21a/96_188_1865_1119/master/1865.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'New South Wales police badges']]",

It gives an insight into the workings of the organisation that produces the Guardian, the Observer, and the Guardian’s editions in the US and Australia, over the last year.', 'This year was the most challenging and extraordinary year for news that I can remember, and I’m sure many of you feel the same way.', 'As you’ll read in this report, our journalists worked tirelessly throughout 2020, from the very start of the year with the Australian bushfires, through the struggle for Hong Kong, the Harvey Weinstein verdict to the death of George Floyd, and the dramatic and divisive US presidential election.', 'But of course, the Covid-19 pandemic was the dominant global story of the year, transforming so much, from our editorial priorities to how we work. Our coverage sought to foreground the science and the latest data, to hold the government and the scientific establishment to account and expose incompetence, and to bring empathy and humanity to the stories of the victims.', 'We realised early on that the pandemic had the capacity to change everything about how we live, so Guardian and Observer journalists devoted formidable effort and resources to investigating the social and economic effects of this crisis. We also understood the important role that endeavour, community and charity would play in confronting the emergency, and so sought out hope wherever it could be found.', 'We expanded our reporting on the climate and environmental crisis, following the movements trying to bring about change, digging deep into the loss of wildlife and investigating the mounting problems of air pollution and microplastics. We also drew the connection between the Covid crisis and the environment, trying to get politicians to understand how the pandemic is the result of our annihilation of nature, year after year.', 'Our investigations team produced a succession of game-changing revelations about the UK government’s handling of the pandemic, such as the scandalous disregard for life in care homes, and the repeated mishandling of vital protection equipment for healthcare workers.', 'In the UK, our sensational revelation, in partnership with the Daily Mirror, that the prime minister’s right-hand man, Dominic Cummings, had travelled from London to Durham during lockdown, and then taken a 50-mile trip to Barnard Castle to “test his eyesight”, resulted in a public outcry. Our reporting, like a lot of the best stories, originated with Guardian readers who told us what they had seen.', 'Our investigations were not limited to the UK. We also revealed further allegations of sexual abuse committed by Donald Trump, and unearthed the disturbing background of his supreme court justice pick, Amy Coney Barrett. We published the Luanda Leaks, showing how Africa’s richest woman, Isabel dos Santos, made her fortune through exploiting her own country, and revealed Jeff Bezos had his phone hacked by the Saudi crown prince – a truly astonishing exposé.', 'These kinds of revelations are at the heart of what we do. Without reader support, we would have fewer resources for the time-consuming, painstaking reporting that often takes weeks or months to get to the front page. If you are a Guardian supporter, thank you for helping us to bring these stories to light.', 'Guardian journalists in the US, UK and around the world have reported with clarity, authority and calm on the Black Lives Matter movement, the debate on monuments to slavery, and the broader social and political questions they raise.', 'In the US, our election coverage included rigorous analysis of the myriad ways millions of Americans are denied voting rights, extensive reporting on the primary and presidential campaigns, and round-the-clock analysis of the election itself. We spoke to voters in often-overlooked communities to understand who and what was motivating them to vote.', 'In Australia, our reporters worked over the festive period to provide unrivalled live coverage of the unprecedented bushfires that ravaged the east coast. The team followed this up with The Frontline, an in-depth multimedia investigation into the many ways the climate emergency is already affecting Australia.', 'Our numbers: +66% in podcast listens, including for Today in Focus, Football Weekly and Full Story **', 'Our multimedia journalism continues to go from strength to strength. Today in Focus, presented by Anushka Asthana, took home the best current affairs podcast prize at this year’s British Podcast Awards.

We now receive support from readers in more than 180 countries, helping us to safeguard the Guardian’s independent journalism.', 'The pandemic and its effects have made life much harder for Guardian readers and supporters around the world. This year, even more than in the past, we are extremely grateful for the financial support readers give to help safeguard our independent journalism.', 'Thank you.', 'I joined the Guardian in March 2020, a few weeks before the first lockdown in the UK. At that point I could never have imagined just how much our business would need to change and adapt in what has been an extraordinary year.', 'My priorities as chief executive throughout the pandemic have been to ensure we continue to serve our readers, digitally and in print, while prioritising the safety of our employees and minimising the economic impact of the pandemic on our business. Strong Guardian journalism relies on a solid business and a team of dedicated commercial colleagues across many different departments. Working life has been very different in 2020, and I am extremely grateful for the commitment and flexibility our employees have shown this year.', 'Our numbers: 2.1 billion unique browsers to our digital platforms, +67% on the year before **', 'The growing appetite for Guardian journalism was reflected in continued growth in readership – we had a record 1.5bn unique browsers and 16.4bn page views to our digital platforms during 2019-20, both up more than 20% on the previous 12 months.', 'Whilst we experienced record digital readership, coronavirus has accelerated difficult changes across the media sector – we have responded by restructuring some areas of our business as part of a strategy to support the Guardian’s long-term commercial growth. Sadly these changes have included job losses for a number of colleagues, to whom we will say goodbye over the next few months. This process has been difficult, and we have aimed to support all those affected as much as possible. We thank those leaving the organisation greatly for their contribution to the Guardian.', 'Despite these pressures, our unique reader relationship model has proved successful. As our editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, writes, the Guardian has provided independent, fact-based journalism to unprecedented numbers of readers and we have seen an increase in readers’ support over the past year.', 'Since the start of 2020, we have gained 268,000 new digital subscriptions and recurring contributions, an increase of 43%. As a result, digital reader revenues have continued to grow – with recurring contributions and digital subscriptions (boosted by the popularity of our flagship Editions app) two critical sources of income to support our business and our journalism. Print subscriptions to the Guardian, the Observer and our international news magazine Guardian Weekly (with 70% of its subscribers living outside the UK) have also grown to record levels. And in the past 12 months we have received more than 530,000 single contributions from readers who believe in the Guardian’s purpose, and want to support us. Including print subscribers and single contributions, people have supported the Guardian financially more than 1.5m times in the last 12 months.', 'Our numbers: 75,000 attendees to our Guardian Live online programme **', 'We adapted very quickly to the new normal. Guardian Live made a successful pivot to digital, with over 75,000 attendees to our online events, and Guardian Jobs supported the NHS, offering free job listings.', 'And, while the advertising market remains challenging, teams have continued to win new business and high-value repeat bookings – a testament to the strength of our relationships and reputation for brilliant execution.', 'Our international outlook and presence continues to deliver for us commercially as well as strengthening Guardian journalism, with significant growth in the US and Australia where we have well-established presences. And, in the year of Brexit, we have had record numbers reading and supporting the Guardian financially from continental Europe. We will continue to invest in the Guardian’s increasingly global business.', 'We live in a time of great economic uncertainty. There are many challenges ahead for the global news media sector, but we remain confident that the Guardian’s core strengths – high-quality, trusted journalism, a meaningful purpose and trusted brand, a highly talented set of employees, and a commitment to being reader-centric and reader-funded – provide a solid foundation for the organisation to achieve long-term success.', 'Thank you for supporting us. In a deeply troubling year it is inspiring that so many readers agree that progressive journalism is needed more than ever.', 'Readers in 180 countries fund our journalism because they believe in our mission, our independence, and our reporting – and that’s inspiring to all of us who work at the Guardian.', 'From our supporters: Only this week I was recommending the Guardian subscription to a friend because it is such good value for the money. Having read today’s newsletter, I have just altered my contribution and will endeavour to increase it further in due course. In this ever more dangerous world and the sinister manoeuvring of our own government, independent reportage with integrity, which is what you provide, is essential and I thank you for it. Liz Hanson, a reader in Melrose, Scotland', 'Our unique ownership model means we are not controlled by a billionaire owner, or a group of shareholders demanding financial returns – any profits made, and all financial contributions from readers, are reinvested directly into our journalism.', 'Many supporters believe, like we do, that everyone deserves access to quality journalism, so choose to help us remain open and free of a paywall. Our supporters tell us that they deeply value the approach we have chosen – where everyone can access Guardian journalism, regardless of where they live, what they can afford, or how they like to consume the news.', 'Alongside our successful contributions model, in 2020 we have a renewed focus on offering digital subscriptions to our premium apps, in order to build a financially sustainable organisation.', 'As part of our ongoing mission to deliver purposeful, quality journalism, we have evolved our digital subscription products in line with the changing demands of readers in a world of constant breaking news, best digital practices and journalistic innovation. In 2020, we introduced a Weekend Edition for Australian readers, as well as a special Earth Edition to sit alongside our UK Daily Edition – available as part of the Guardian’s digital subscription. We also launched Guardian Puzzles – a dedicated app for crosswords and puzzles from the Guardian and the Observer.', 'From our supporters: I so appreciate the excellent and authentic reporting that the Guardian does – never more than now. I depend on your reporters and photographers to cover US stories with a deep cultural understanding of not only the news, but also the underlying issues that provide a necessary context to truly make sense of where we find ourselves today. Thank you for all that you all do! Susan E Werbe, a reader in Newton, Massachusetts, US', 'Remarkably, despite the health and economic depredations of Covid-19, record numbers of readers chose to financially support us in 2020. The ongoing developments around the global coronavirus pandemic, the Black Lives Matter movement as well as the Guardian’s climate pledge and its US election coverage have all been significant drivers of reader support.', 'Our numbers: 900,000 digital recurring acts of support, +43% since November 2019 **', 'The Guardian has gained 268,000 new digital subscriptions and recurring contributions over the last year, an increase of 43%. Total digital recurring support now stands at over 900,000, up from 632,000 in November 2019. An 11% year-on-year increase in subscriptions to print products helped offset the hit from the global pandemic to newsstand sales. We now have a record 119,000 print subscriptions across the Guardian, the Observer and Guardian Weekly. In the 12 months to end of October 2020, the Guardian also received over 530,000 single contributions from readers across the world. Including print subscribers and single contributions, people have supported the Guardian financially more than 1.5m times in the last 12 months.', 'In the past few months, we have started to encourage readers to sign in when they visit the Guardian digitally, so we can remember their preferences, improve their experience of the site, and tailor the messages and advertising they see.', 'Strengthening our relationship with our readers, combined with award-winning journalism that the world needs right now, along with our huge reach globally is how we’ll attract more people to support the Guardian financially by the end of our 200th anniversary.', '2020 has been a year of monumental disruption, tragedy, activism and change. Throughout these disorienting times, we have sought to go beyond simply reporting the news to provide clarity, hold the powerful to account, and bring empathy and humanity to stories that may otherwise go untold.', 'More than ever, our evidence-based journalism and rigorous analysis has sought to be comprehensive, authoritative and calm – allowing Guardian readers to navigate an at times overwhelming volume of information and noise.', 'Coronavirus is one of the biggest and most complex stories of our time, touching on all facets of life – politics, science, the economy, people’s lives and relationships. Throughout, our reporting on the pandemic has been expert and courageous – not only in holding those in power to account for their handling of the crisis, but in bringing warmth and humanity to a bleak period and focusing on the tragic stories of the hundreds of thousands of lives lost around the world.', 'Our numbers: 63% growth in subscribers to Guardian YouTube channels **', 'In the early days of the crisis, our 100 Days series looked closely at the growing international impact of the pandemic and our insightful video explainers and Q&As clearly guided our readers to the facts during an increasingly complicated time. We pivoted our Science Weekly podcast to focus on listeners’ questions about the virus – doubling the podcast’s audience in just a few months. And, as the situation worsened, our Lost to the Virus series and Lost on the Frontline, a Guardian US and Kaiser Health News initiative, highlighted the immense human cost with care and sensitivity. Lost on the Frontline has become the exclusive US data source for Amnesty International’s initiative to track deaths of global healthcare workers from Covid-19. The series also influenced the Frontline Heroes Act, a proposed legislation in the US Congress to provide support for the families of fallen healthcare workers and was referenced by Senator Ron Wyden during a hearing about the national PPE shortage.', 'We have never lost sight of the importance in holding the powerful to account for their role in managing the crisis. Within the Guardian’s investigations team we established a coronavirus investigations wing, publishing a string of exclusives. We uncovered who attends the secret scientific Sage advisory group – and revealed Boris Johnson’s then chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, attended meetings. We revealed the private firm running the UK PPE stockpile, Movianto, was sold in the middle of the pandemic and in a joint exclusive with ITV revealed chaotic conditions at Movianto’s warehouse, which resulted in delays in deploying vital supplies to UK healthcare workers. Our in-depth piece looking at missed opportunities pre-lockdown, the inside story of herd immunity and behind-the-scenes tussles between scientists and politicians was a comprehensive picture of the UK’s missteps. More recently, our journalists unpicked the allegations of “chumocracy” at the heart of the pandemic response, with a series of revelatory stories. In opinion, we discussed the government’s secret Covid contracts.', 'Most notable was our sensational exclusive (with the Daily Mirror) on Cummings’ lockdown trip, which provoked national outrage and created the biggest crisis in trust for the UK government in recent years. The scoop forced Cummings to explain his actions in a Downing Street garden press conference and led the prime minister to make the extraordinary claim that his senior adviser had done nothing wrong and that people needed to ‘move on’ despite millions of people having abided by the rules.', 'As both Johnson and Donald Trump succumbed to the virus, we closely covered the news of the president’s Covid diagnosis, hospitalisation, bizarre joyride, and his contagious inner circle. And we looked at how Johnson’s diagnosis, denials and admissions took the nation on an emotional rollercoaster.', 'We challenged Trump’s claims that hydroxychloroquine was a “miracle cure” drug and revealed how the leader of a group peddling bleach as a coronavirus cure wrote to the president the week before he promoted disinfectant as a possible treatment. We improved and continue to update our coronavirus trackers and UK regional breakdowns, providing a valuable service to our readers over many months. And, following a reader callout, our science team answered questions about the pandemic covering everything from vaping to vaccines.', 'We focused on its effect on young people with a new project – the Covid Generation – telling their stories, from missed education to the toll on mental health, through powerful words, portraits and their own lockdown drawings. We also provided hope by sharing practical and positive stories in series such as Guardian Australia’s The Good Place, the young entrepreneurs defying lockdown, and Anywhere but Westminster’s lockdown specials.', 'Our correspondents around the globe contributed to our coronavirus coverage and our understanding of how different countries tackled the pandemic, from Iran – a country in the grip of one of the worst outbreaks – to how Venezuela used the crisis as a cover to crack down on dissent. From the plight of tourists trapped in a Tenerife hotel, to the eerily empty streets of Milan and the desperation of Covid sufferers in Beijing.', 'We looked at the scandal of the Ruby Princess in Australia and the British holidaymakers stuck on cruise ships unable to dock. We followed the quarantine of Melbourne and the easing of restrictions, including a fantastic First Dog cartoon and a look at how Melbourne residents embraced their first day of freedom.', 'Our coverage of the pandemic was also recognised as some of the most trusted among the major news brands. Oxford University’s Reuters Institute for Journalism cited the Guardian as doing the best job of all the papers among UK media outlets, and ranked us as the second most visited UK news site for coronavirus updates, second only to the BBC. A separate Survation study also named the Guardian as the most trusted UK paper on the topic.', 'Outside of the pandemic, the other major global story of 2020 has been the Black Lives Matter movement. Our coverage since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on 25 May has been urgent, thought-provoking and clear in what has been a deeply personal and emotionally charged moment for so many. With journalists located around the world, we have been able to provide a unique and intimate perspective on the worldwide protest movement for justice.', 'In the US, we reported, often under difficult conditions, on the protests for justice, incidents of police brutality and counter-demonstrations by racist militias. We investigated how communities of colour are enduring three crises at once: endemic police violence, Covid-19, and an economic crisis threatening jobs and livelihoods. Our coverage explored the history of brutal police violence and systemic racism in the US, and the institutional reforms needed to make a meaningful difference. Our journalists reported on these events, and the broader social and political questions they beg, with clarity, authority and purpose. We raised the voices of protesters, armed our readers with the facts, and provided wide-ranging perspectives on the government response. We profiled the black-led groups leading the calls for justice, the families directly affected by police brutality and asked what it really means to ”defund the police”. We exposed how structural poverty and enduring racism in the deep South has a direct impact on the deaths of black Americans from Covid-19, and our exclusive piece on the impacts of global heating further revealed how black and brown neighbourhoods would be unequally affected. Our interview with Bubba Wallace, Nascar’s only black driver, revealed rapidly changing attitudes to race in the sport.', 'In Australia, we continue to focus on Indigenous Australians and the injustices they experience. We broke stories on outrages involving the mining company Rio Tinto, reporting on the firm’s decision to blow up a sacred Aboriginal site and the flawed legislation that allowed it. Our reporting ultimately led to the resignation of Rio Tinto’s CEO and senior executives as well as a parliamentary inquiry recommending a moratorium on any destruction of potential heritage sites until laws are passed in the new year. Our multiple award-winning Deaths Inside series, which has examined every Indigenous death in custody since 2008, continued to uncover stories of injustice this year. Images of protesters, who marched in cities and towns around Australia in support of Black Lives Matter, cited our Deaths Inside project and our investigations into the death of David Dungay Jnr to highlight systemic racism in Australia.', 'In light of the toppling of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol, we reported from communities across the UK. Our Young, British and Black series highlighted 50 voices of this generation and we launched a powerful Black Lives series that looked at the extraordinary stories of the people at the forefront of social change and civil rights. And, to celebrate Black History Month, we produced an interactive timeline documenting two millennia of world-shaping individuals and momentous events that define black history and gave away glossy wallcharts with the newspaper.', 'Our opinion writers also covered the shocking global implications and big new ideas emerging from the crisis in The World Turned Upside Down series, and highlighted the renewed urgency of anti-racist movements in America and the UK in columns by Patricia Williams on George Floyd’s killing, and Afua Hirsch on racism built in Britain.', 'Although coronavirus has dominated the news in the UK, we’ve continued to report rigorously on other stories that are affecting people’s lives.', 'On 31 January, we marked Brexit eve, capturing the mood of the nation, from Westminster to West Yorkshire. We wrote about the pain thousands of our readers felt and published our “Missing You Already” supplement, which included a moving series of letters to the UK from key cultural figures, generating an appreciative response from our readers.', 'Away from Brexit, our reporting has captured the complexities of the coronavirus pandemic, a multitude of government U-turns, tumultuous party politics and reflected a determination to capture the hidden effects of an unprecedented year.', 'With input from thousands of pupils, teachers and parents via our communities team, we led the way in our reporting on the GCSE and A-levels fiasco – from our exclusive forecast that 40% of A-level results would be downgraded to revealing that the chair of Ofqual threatened to quit unless the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, publicly backed him.', 'In business, we went back undercover at Sports Direct and discovered that question marks remain over the chain’s treatment of staff. We also covered the dramatic events as two of Britain’s biggest retailers collapsed – the demise of Philip Green’s empire and, the following day, of Debenhams. Off the back of Guardian reporting that consistently called for organisations such as Tesco to review their stance on rate rebates, big supermarket chains changed their positions and repaid hundreds of millions to the treasury.', 'Our coverage of the EHRC’s damning report into antisemitism in the Labour party was detailed and revelatory, including our scoop revealing the key insights the day before the report was released. And – in the same week – we published a letter signed by more than 800 legal figures, accusing the government of dangerous rhetoric and calling for an immediate apology.', 'As footballer Marcus Rashford’s campaign to end child food poverty captured the public’s imagination, we spoke to the families dependent on free school meals. And it was inspiring for us to read that Rashford was driven to campaign for free school meals after reading an article in the Guardian.', 'And, with the ongoing inquiry into the Grenfell fire – which restarted in September 2020, 28 months since it began – we continued to highlight this hugely important story, covering the fallouts from the inquiry and speaking with the survivors still seeking justice.', 'Our investigative reporting has continued to expose and uncover injustices across the UK. In March, a critical court judgment into Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum found he had orchestrated the abduction of his two daughters. This was the culmination of a 20-year inquiry that began with a Guardian exclusive. We doggedly followed the long and bitter court battle, which revealed UK police had been deterred from investigating the kidnap.', 'We secured leaked Foreign Office documents, which uncovered that it was No 10 – not the Home Office – driving controversial plans to process asylum seekers in other countries.', 'We have also maintained our focus on previous Guardian exclusives. Since the Guardian exposed the scandal of the wrongful deportation of Commonwealth citizens from the Caribbean in 2018, the Windrush debate continued with our reporting on the number of people entitled to compensation who may still be unknown. The EHRC Windrush report was a damning indictment of the hostile environment policy and the seventh critical report arising from our reporting.', 'We reported on a public inquiry into undercover policing, which launched in November – six years after it was first announced. The inquiry was a result of a Guardian investigation revealing how police covertly monitored the campaign for justice over the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence. It followed years of disclosures uncovered by the Guardian and by the activists who had been the victims of spying.', 'In the US, the Guardian has continued to deliver deep and impactful journalism during a year in which the country’s social, economic and political fabric was dramatically challenged. We repeatedly broke news on the Trump administration’s constant departure from norms, starting with the anger and divisiveness of his state of the union address, shortly followed by Nancy Pelosi’s electrifying response.', 'A key strand of our election coverage was our year-long Fight to Vote series – which launched in 2019. It assessed the many ways Americans are denied the fundamental right to vote, and included an ambitious ballot-tracking exercise. Our piece on Trump’s admission that he was undermining the US Postal Service to make it harder to vote by mail was cited in a lawsuit against the USPS. The project continues to deliver essential reporting on Trump’s attempts to defy the election outcome.', 'In February, we detailed how the president survived impeachment and reflected on a decade in which America swung from the hope of the Obama era to the nihilism and misogyny of Trump. We chronicled the Democratic primaries and reported on Kamala Harris’s memorable challenge to Joe Biden’s race record.', 'Our numbers: +100 million page views to the Guardian’s US election live results tracker **', 'We followed the twists and turns as the Republican party rushed to fill the supreme court seat left open after the death of Ruth Bader Ginsberg. An exclusive Guardian investigation revealed that Amy Coney Barrett – Trump’s now-confirmed supreme court justice – was involved with a secretive Christian group, a story cited by the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, in his attack on the media. Our reporting on Coney Barrett’s anti-abortion stance was referenced by Senator Richard Blumenthal, who credited the Guardian for making key information public while questioning Barrett during the hearings.', 'Our election explainers – including the inventive Build Your Own Election and how the electoral college helps the Republicans, enabled readers to visualise paths to victory for both candidates. Our live election results tracker was a monumental success and, along with our round the clock live blog, was a cornerstone of our coverage. Almost a year in planning, the tracker broke all traffic records, becoming the Guardian’s most viewed page ever, culminating in more than 100m page views in election week. It formed part of a record-breaking week for the Guardian overall, with more than 190m page views and 52.9m unique browsers worldwide within 24 hours.', 'Our Today in Focus special US election episode took listeners through the momentous night moving from New York to Florida, Arizona to Pennsylvania and trying to make sense of what happened. After the election result was eventually called, we profiled the president-elect, looking at how Biden styled himself as the antithesis of Trumpism and at the election of Kamala Harris, the first woman of colour to be voted vice-president.', 'Outside of politics, our journalists followed the sexual assault and rape trial of the disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein. As a guilty verdict was handed down, we broke the news before other major news organisations, and documented his rise and fall, the key moments of the trial, the six women at the heart of the trial and how it divided the #MeToo movement.', 'In December, we also joined a global consortium to continue the work of murdered Mexican journalists. In collaboration with 24 international media outlets across 18 countries, and coordinated by Forbidden Stories, the Cartel Project investigates the global networks of Mexican drug cartels and their political connections around the world.', 'Our reporting has also focused on society, culture and lifestyle. Our State of Men series took a hard look at what it means to be male in 2020. In a similar vein, we launched Childfree, a series in which women spoke openly about their decisions to not have children. And our pandemic epiphanies series centred on positive stories on what writers and readers discovered about themselves during the pandemic. Our series Trans Freedom Fighters shone a light on the trans and non-binary leaders on the frontlines of 2020 organising and activism in the US.', 'Our brilliant reporting of the massive Australian bushfires continued into 2020, as the devastating fires continued to burn across vast areas of the country. In the most devastating bushfire season ever, our small team closely followed events as conditions worsened, from Mallacoota beach to Bairnsdale, where conditions on the ground proved most devastating. Our analysis of the fires and the failure of the prime minister to act, or even acknowledge the connection to the climate crisis, shocked the world. Our innovative visual explainer showed how the 2020 fires are very different from those in previous years with an exclusive story revealing how the Australian government approved a Chinese company to run a water mining operation in drought-stricken Queensland.', 'Our political reporting in Australia has exposed significant flaws, consistently holding the government to account.', 'Our dogged coverage of the robodebt scandal culminated in November 2020 with a $1.2b payout to 400,000 victims. We revealed how the coalition government believed it had no duty of care for welfare recipients, and also exposed the questionable $400k grant given to an aged care home operator when others missed out.', 'The New South Wales corruption tribunal was gripping, and exposed how the state premier, Gladys Berejiklian, had been in a secret relationship with a disgraced former MP, with excellent commentary on the fallout and unanswered questions.', 'We continued our scrutiny of the government’s role in the climate emergency. In our Green Recovery series in May, we highlighted how there were many ways stimulus spending might have also hastened the transition to a low-carbon economy, but the government didn’t take up those options and the year ends with Australia’s climate policy debate still stuck in an endless loop of political rhetoric, but under increasingly critical scrutiny from the rest of the world.', 'Facebook has apologised for defamatory posts about an Australian politician – it was not even prepared to delete the posts until Guardian Australia reported on the case in August.', 'We also explored how Australia is starting to recognise coalmining might not be viable long term, including an exclusive on the private investigator working for the controversial Adani mine who secretly spied on and photographed an activist’s family. We also exclusively revealed a photograph of an Australian soldier drinking beer from a prosthetic leg thought to belong to a Taliban fighter killed by special forces in Afghanistan.', 'And finally, The Wait series gave a voice to people and places that may otherwise go unheard, telling the story of the forgotten refugees stranded in Indonesia as a result of Australia’s border crackdowns.', 'Guardian Australia has led the reporting on many of these local stories and will continue to pursue them, because facts and accountability matter, for good public policy and to shore up citizens’ trust in the political system.', 'At the start of the year, our groundbreaking scoop revealed that Jeff Bezos had his phone hacked by the Saudi crown prince.

The story had an immediate and far-reaching impact, and was followed up all over the world.', 'The New Zealand election was another huge moment; from the details of Jacinda Ardern’s win and possible coalition to our reporting on the broader political picture on why the country does not respond to populism in ways other countries do.', 'We ran a series of deeply moving pieces to mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, including a beautiful dispatch from the memorial ceremony. We also spoke with survivors who returned to the camp for the anniversary in a series of heart-wrenching interviews, including on Today in Focus.', 'Our This is Europe series featured many memorable stories — from our exclusive on the EU’s support for vulnerable EU nationals to remain in the UK, and research on rising support for Eurosceptic parties, to a collection of European critics’ responses to UK culture. We launched Europeans – a series of seven new films from across Europe and revealed how Europe’s demographic map is being reshaped from Germany to Spain.', 'We focused on the profound changes taking place in Hong Kong in our Fight for Hong Kong series.

We later told the stories of the people caught up in the blast in an extraordinary interactive using footage survivors captured on their smartphones.', 'As protests continued in Belarus over the re-election of Alexander Lukashenko, a Guardian documentary followed three independent Belarusian film-makers as they turned their cameras on themselves and their communities.

Our feature on how Jürgen Klopp transformed Liverpool provided great insights, as did our exclusive interview with Liverpool’s title-winning captain, Jordan Henderson.', 'In October, our exclusive investigation revealed how much the FA chairman, Greg Clarke, and the Premier League knew, but did not admit, about secret Operation Big Picture talks. We also explored how the plans did not go far enough for women’s football. One of our Sportblog pieces was hailed by Gary Lineker as “the most sensible and balanced comment piece I’ve read on this by far”. In November, Clarke resigned after a disastrous select committee appearance, while our guide to the US golf Masters provided much-needed cheer. We were also the first to report on a revelatory film about Liverpool and Klopp and featured a vivid interview with the boxer Bilal Fawaz.', 'During the past year we’ve continued to report on every aspect of the environment – publishing a piece of environmental journalism roughly every three hours. In October, we renewed our commitment to readers, pledging to keep reporting on the climate emergency, raising the alarm and investigating the crisis and possible solutions.

As part of a year-long series on America’s water crisis, with partner Consumer Reports, our landmark investigation revealed how millions of ordinary Americans are facing unaffordable bills for running water.

This announcement sent a signal to encourage other companies to follow our lead, increasing the pressure on oil companies, miners and other extractive industries to change course. Our exclusive on the vast profits made by big oil since 1990 served as a timely reminder of their role in the escalating climate emergency. And, in the lead-up to Davos, Greta Thunberg and other climate strikers wrote for us urging world leaders to abandon the fossil fuel economy.', 'Despite it being a tricky year for in-person interviews, we’ve still featured some fantastic names – Tom Hanks on surviving coronavirus, Black Lives Matter founder Alicia Garza on stepping away from the movement she helped create, the warm and irrepressible Miriam Margolyes and Samuel L Jackson on roots, race and revolution, Helena Bonham Carter on divorce, Pierce Brosnan on life after Bond and a hilarious Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.

In our staycation special, comedians shared their worst trips and, after Blind date went temporarily virtual, we were thrilled to see it back in the wild.', 'Philanthropic funding supports impactful, mission-driven reporting projects at the Guardian. Our projects are often timely, but none more so this year than the Fight to Vote series, which was supported by foundations including Craig Newmark Philanthropies and the Park Foundation. This series launched a year before the US presidential election and was a critical anchor of our election coverage. With philanthropic support for a dedicated editorial team, reporting from the series established the role of Republican suppression tactics and the campaign to undermine election integrity long before the election. The Guardian was first to cover the shift to mail-in voting, the role of USPS, and Trump’s false claims of widespread voter fraud, and broke many stories, including one on dark money behind voting restrictions and the Trump campaign’s first failed attempts to prove voter fraud.', 'Similarly, the Age of Extinction series supported by the BAND Foundation and the Wyss Foundation – which reports on the global biodiversity catastrophe – has ensured that our interconnectedness with nature and its critical role in our own existence has remained a front-and-centre consideration among policymakers across the world dealing with the Covid outbreak, including the UN and the UK government.', 'Support from an array of funders including Humanity United, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Packard Foundation, Open Philanthropy Project and the 11th Hour Fund continues to make possible in-depth and vital storytelling on a range of environmental issues, such as the global impact of intensive farming practices, the dramatic changes taking place in our oceans, and the ongoing damages to our public lands. Award-winning reporting on global inequality, poverty, and human rights will continue in the years ahead, with expanded support for the series on labour exploitation and modern slavery and the continuation of the global development site. We have seen immense impact across our projects, all of which are contributing to delivering change at a policy level as well as creating a lasting impact for the individuals affected by the issues.', 'An incredible special report in the Observer on the Femicide Census, about the number of women killed by men every year was a truly shocking story, opening up the discussion on violence towards women. It came not long after readers expressed concern about the Guardian publishing an obituary of the convicted rapist and murderer Peter Sutcliffe – a sensitive topic covered by our readers’ editor in a thoughtful column, in addition to reporting of his victims and their stories.', 'In the run up to the US election, the Observer continued to dissect the role of Facebook and the potential issues the platform could cause for Biden, including two powerful interviews with the whistleblower Yaël Eisenstat and early investor Roger McNamee. A deep dive into Facebook also looked at the pivotal role the platform would play in the US elections.', 'In July, the Observer revealed how pressure from Donald Trump led to the British government banning the Chinese technology giant Huawei from its 5G telecoms network.

The star of the film Clemency, Alfre Woodard spoke to Observer New Review about the US prison system, her enslaved great-grandfather and her hopes for Black Lives Matter.', 'In a noisy media landscape, Guardian US stands out by providing a global perspective on American events and issues. Our reporters are rooted in communities across the country – with bureaux on the East Coast, including New York and Washington DC, the West Coast and in the South – and our vision is to continue to expand our coverage across the US.', '2020 has been a momentous year. From the Trump administration’s mishandling of the pandemic, to the atrocious killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others that led to the powerful resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement, and a dramatic US election – our journalism has been authoritative and courageous. In this year of extraordinary upheaval, we’ve shared wide-ranging perspectives, elevated underrepresented voices, challenged controversial decisions on the climate crisis, and held the powerful to account.', 'Reporting a presidential election in the midst of a pandemic presented new and interesting challenges for our news desk. A virtual newsroom replaced a crowded office. Major decisions were made via instant messaging instead of across desk dividers. Reporters were equipped with PPE to ensure they could do their jobs safely. What did not change was our commitment to be in as many places as possible, and speak to as many people as we could.', 'From our supporters: Thank you so much for both covering terrible news incidents, and reporting about them in a way that speaks for peace and justice. I’m not black. I am Cuban-American and I trust the Guardian to report the news with a good heart, being honest and balanced.

Our non-stop journalism drove record breaking traffic: on Wednesday 4 November, the day after the election, the Guardian recorded its highest-ever digital traffic, reaching more than 190m page views and 53m unique browsers worldwide in 24 hours, exceeding all previous traffic records by a huge margin. The Guardian’s live results tracker alone received more than 100m page views in election week and we also reached a larger number of Guardian readers in the US than ever before – 165m page views from 70m unique browsers in the month of November.', 'Just as the Black Lives Matter movement in the US, and the global reckoning it spurred, defined much of our coverage this year, it also inspired us to look inward and assess how we could improve our own diversity, equity and inclusion, to ensure we better reflect the communities we serve and allow for a more diverse range of perspectives. In addition to the Guardian’s global commitments to anti-racism, in the US we made explicit commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion that involved changing our newsroom practices and systems to make them more equitable, and building a more equal culture.', 'The degrading treatment of journalists by law enforcement, encouraged by political cheerleaders, is another deeply troubling aspect of these events. And our journalists have been reporting up close, at personal risk, to make sure millions of readers around the world can see for themselves what’s taking place. Throughout the year, Donald Trump continued to peddle disinformation, not just about the integrity of the news media, as he had done for the previous four years, but this time about coronavirus. Most notable was the misinformation he spread around the level of danger it posed and potential cures. As his daily coronavirus briefings became a platform for lies, campaigning and denials, Guardian political reporters were there, interrogating his claims and arming readers the facts, prioritising public safety in a way the administration was not.', 'From our supporters: I would like to congratulate the Guardian on the depth and breadth of the coverage over last week in relation to the election … thanks for the excellent journalism you continue to provide which is why I have no hesitation in continuing to subscribe to the paper. Louis Boyle, a reader in County Down, Northern Ireland **', 'We continue to reject climate denial rhetoric, doubling down on our commitments to the environment both in our reporting and as an organisation. In America, we joined forces with hundreds of newsrooms to promote climate solutions as part of Covering Climate Now. We also invited first-time voters to take over the Guardian homepage as part of climate week. Beyond our partnership with CCN, we collaborated with other like-minded partners to go deeper and further on stories that matter to Americans. We teamed up with Kaiser Health News to launch Lost on the Frontline – an interactive documenting every healthcare worker lost to Covid – and we launched America’s Water Crisis with Consumer Reports to investigate the challenges many in the US face getting access to safe, clean, affordable water.', 'Our base of recurring supporters also hit a milestone this year, surpassing 150,000 in August. This extraordinary growth is something we value deeply and which allows us to continue the essential reporting we do. This support was matched by an outpouring of generosity during our end-of-year campaign last year. Each year, we set an ambitious target to raise money for our journalism. In our 2019-20 end-of-year appeal, we raised $1.5m from more than 30,000 readers in every state across America.', 'This year, our new partnership with Apple News also introduced millions more Americans to Guardian journalism. The US business has continued to grow steadily, contributing positively to the Guardian as a whole.', 'Guardian US will continue to cover the stories that matter in America, with ever more readers and supporters who believe in our unique perspective, our business model and our editorial purpose.

Appreciation for Guardian Australia’s coverage was reflected in strong audience growth and record financial support.', 'Shortly after, the outbreak of Covid-19 propelled audience growth to record levels. The number of unique browsers increased by 104% in March alone to 11.6 million, making Guardian Australia the country’s fourth most popular news site. By August, several months into the pandemic, audience numbers remained high at 7.4 million, a year-on-year increase of 72%, cementing Guardian Australia’s position as the country’s leading progressive news brand.', 'From our supporters: To me, Guardian Australia is one of the last bastions of independent journalism in this country. It is essential to any democracy that we have a free and independent press. They hold those in power to account, interrogate issues and inform the masses. The Guardian does those things for me. Charmaine, a reader in Victoria, Australia', 'Throughout the turbulent and challenging events of 2020, Guardian Australia’s stretched newsroom still managed to produce a series of distinctive, in-depth journalistic projects. The Frontline series took readers inside Australia’s lived experience of climate change, from new bushfire zones to disappearing underwater forests, while The Green Recovery series explored the environmental opportunities in Australia’s post-pandemic recovery. The Full Story podcast is continuing to grow strongly and was recognised at the 2020 Australian Podcast Awards, winning silver in the best current affairs podcast category, and bronze in the best documentary podcast category.', 'In partnership with the University of NSW, Guardian Australia introduced Temporary, a narrative podcast series that tells the stories of refugees stuck in legal limbo in Australia.

For their coverage of Rio Tinto’s destruction of Juukan Gorge cave, a sacred Indigenous site in Western Australia, Lorena Allam and Calla Wahlquist won the Walkley award for coverage of Indigenous affairs.', 'Guardian Australia’s latest series, Dreams interrupted, investigates how the pandemic is shaping a generation of young Australians who now find themselves in a recession that will have an outsized impact on the trajectory of their lives. The series, funded by the Barlow Foundation, will also explore how it is that so many Indigenous children are in jail, and how the disruptions of 2020 can give rise to an environmentally friendly recovery.', 'In Australia, the challenges to journalism from many quarters are unrelenting – perpetual job losses, the reduction in the number of regional news outlets and cuts to the public broadcaster. In the face of these conditions, Guardian Australia made a concerted effort to grow its community to 150,000 supporters. The fundraiser was the first premised on supporting Guardian Australia itself, rather than distinct editorial projects, and was highly successful. The target was surpassed ahead of schedule, and several innovative features were launched, including an interactive map to display messages from supporters across the country.', 'Our numbers: 150,000 community of supporters across Australia **', 'Amid the softening Covid-19 advertising market, Guardian Australia was bolstered by philanthropic support from VivCourt, the Judith Neilson Institute and the Limb Family Foundation. Meanwhile, a grant from the Balnaves Foundation helped fund a dedicated arts reporter for three years, and a grant confirmed from the Barlow Impact Group will fund three upcoming projects on youth inequality.

Our values – of honesty, integrity, courage, fairness, and a sense of duty to the reader and the community – are likewise reflected in our people, culture and organisational impact.', 'Coronavirus brought a year of extraordinary change to working practices for Guardian employees around the world. We responded quickly to the pandemic, shifting the majority of our workforce to remote working – with only very small groups of essential staff producing the website and newspaper from our offices in London. We have been forced to rethink our ways of working, adapt to the virtual world and overcome the challenges of keeping our teams connected with one another.', 'Coronavirus has also accelerated many of the long-term trends affecting the news industry and, like many other titles, several areas of our business have faced financial pressures. In July 2020, we announced that we would need to restructure a number of areas, which sadly included job losses, meaning a number of valued colleagues left the organisation this year.', 'Inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, many organisations, including the Guardian, have had to recognise that there is still much work for us to do. People from different backgrounds have different perspectives on what makes “news” and we recognise our employees need to reflect the audiences we serve. We have made some advances in diversifying the Guardian in recent years, but we need to accelerate our efforts so we are better equipped to produce more meaningful and more impactful journalism.', 'Working collaboratively with our People of Colour groups based in the UK and US, we announced a company-wide commitment to anti-racism and plans to improve representation of black, Asian and minority ethnic people throughout the organisation. This work culminated in a comprehensive race action plan that looks closely at how we operate across all levels of the company; from hiring to remuneration, training to career progression. We commissioned Marcus Ryder, an expert on media diversity, to review our target of at least 20% black, Asian, minority ethnic (BAME) representation across the organisation, and to make recommendations for department-specific goals.', 'Our efforts in this space have also involved reflecting on the Guardian’s history. In July, the Scott Trust commissioned research on the Guardian’s founding moments to identify any connections – direct or indirect – with the slave trade. The work will be carried out independently by the University of Nottingham’s Institute for the Study of Slavery, and will investigate any links between the Guardian’s founder, John Edward Taylor, his associates, their investments and/or business activities with historical transatlantic slavery.', 'These commitments build on work we have already done. In December 2019, we released our first UK ethnicity pay gap report – one of only a small number of media organisations to do so. The ethnicity pay report is an extension of the yearly reporting we already do on our gender pay gap reporting and identifies key areas of focus.', 'We have continued the important work of our employee-led diversity and inclusion forum to secure a consistent and strategic approach to drive real change across the business. This year, we signed up to the Business in the Community Race at Work charter, implementing the five calls to action. In January, we held our second diversity and inclusion week in the UK, attended by more than one-third of employees, and provided virtual events, training and learning opportunities – all aimed at cultivating a working environment that celebrates and supports difference in all its forms.', 'Mental health and wellbeing has also been a key focus for us at the Guardian, particularly in response to the uncertainty and change brought on by the pandemic. In May, we held a week of events and workshops to mark Mental Health Awareness Week in the UK, and have since launched new workshops on mental health for line managers and employees across the organisation. We continue to provide free employee assistance programmes in the UK, US and Australia, and on-demand resources to promote strong mental health.', 'We show our commitment to tackle the climate crisis in three key ways – through sustained world-leading environmental journalism; through measuring our own carbon emissions and by working with our employees to make significant changes and lead by example. In January, we made global headlines announcing we would no longer accept advertising from fossil fuel extractive companies. Greta Thunberg, Naomi Klein, Greenpeace, Extinction Rebellion and Global Witness publicly supported our landmark decision and readers were delighted when we told them the news.', 'In October 2020, we announced new climate commitments and launched further editorial and business initiatives, including a climate data dashboard. Our climate plan has been informed by a full audit of greenhouse gas emissions from Guardian Media Group’s direct and indirect emissions, with newspaper production and our print supply chain the biggest contributors to the Guardian’s carbon footprint. We renewed our environmental commitments in a letter to readers, with an ambitious business goal of eliminating at least two-thirds of our total emissions by 2030. In 2020, our employee sustainability forum supported the development of our Climate Pledge 2020 and our promise to prioritise the escalating climate crisis in our journalism and our business decisions.', 'Our commitment to the environment has also been widely recognised. In 2020, the Guardian was awarded the first sustainability strategy of the year award at the Newspaper & Magazine Awards, in October we were named winner in the business transformation category at the Reuters Responsible Business Awards, and in November we won the prestigious BBVA Foundation Biophilia Award for Environmental Communication for the Guardian’s environmental reporting, which the foundation said had had a “transformative impact” in the global community.', 'Through the Scott Trust, our independent charity the Guardian Foundation supports media under threat, promotes diversity in the media and empowers children and young people to engage with the news. The charity envisions a world in which all people can tell their stories, access the truth and hold power to account.', 'In the last 12 months, the Guardian Foundation’s award-winning free news literacy project, in partnership with National Literacy Trust and PSHE Association, NewsWise, educated 2,563 children aged seven to 11 in 47 primary schools in disadvantaged areas across the UK. The results are inspiring – after taking part in the programme, twice as many pupils were able to tell whether a news story was real or fake (from 32.7% to 67.2%) and pupils were more than twice as likely to feel able to tell if a news source was trustworthy (33.3% to 82.8%).', 'In response to school closures as a result of coronavirus, NewsWise created a family zone with activities, links, tips and advice to help families learn more about the news together, a series of teacher training webinars and the Happy News Project to help primary pupils transition back to school with a focus on wellbeing, with uplifting stories, teamwork, speaking and news writing.

But I’m not really interested in the economy; I’m interested in what makes a person feel alive. And getting involved with a campaign, no matter how big, can make you feel much better, much more engaged – even energised – than just sitting and worrying about the state of the world.', 'How does an effective campaigner get started? I asked Alena Ivanova, 33, because I think she embodies the activist life well lived. She came to the UK eight years ago from Bulgaria, where there are very few entry points to activism: no developed student movement, little spontaneous campaigning. “It was living in London that radicalised me. I thought things would be different, but better. Actually they were different, but the same: people were just as devoid of real power to make decisions about their lives, and it was so expensive that everyone was too busy working to think about it. You either have to make a retreat into yourself, or you have to commit to trying to make it better for everyone.”', 'Ivanova found groups through word-of-mouth. A guy she met on Tinder suggested a left-wing reading group; from there she joined the Women’s Strike and Sisters Uncut; and then got involved with the Labour party. She’s since battled everything from the closure of a community language programme to Britain exiting the EU. “National campaigns, which were epic failures, local campaigns, which were small failures. My only experience of success was getting the freedom of movement motion past the Labour conference.” This was in 2019, when an overwhelming number of motions forced the party not only to uphold freedom of movement – which their 2017 manifesto had promised to end – but to extend it. Ivanova ruefully points out that there’s little mention of this motion now.', 'But if you think political action seems worth it only when it succeeds, going in a straight line from raising awareness, through fundraising, to getting parliamentary attention, to changing the law, well, you have to ditch all that. It’s not couch to 5k: you can’t put your civic identity through a set of key performance indicators. This is why activism and voluntary work are different from the usual run of happiness-booster suggestions: because you can’t control the outcome simply by working harder, you almost certainly won’t always succeed and there will be moments where, if you care, it is very painful. That’s the joy, I suppose: it’s more like life than yoga is. But just like yoga, you have to find an approach that works for you. To decide which, ask yourself these key questions:', 'The assumption about altruism is that you have to want to interact the whole time – in an activist context, to be in constant debate or always at a protest; and in charity work, be dealing directly with someone in need.', 'But there are roles for all personality types. Sophie Livingstone, 43, runs Trustees Unlimited (a company that matches charities with trustees, and that aims, among other things, to improve diversity among trustee bodies). She is shortly to take over at Little Village, a baby bank (like a food bank but for baby-related gear), and says, “We have volunteers who interact directly with families, but there are other people who just want to sort babygrows.” Both are useful.', 'The same is true politically: if canvassing is your idea of hell, you might help behind the scenes, with organising or planning. Perhaps you could devise a map of food poverty like All Of Us Together, which was inspired by Marcus Rashford’s campaign; or if you can code, join the Radical Engineers and be matched with a project that needs a developer.', 'Once you have a passion for a cause, such as migrant rights, there are a near infinite number of entry points, from housing a refugee yourself to resisting racism locally. Zoe Gardner, 32, is policy adviser at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants. She describes grassroots initiatives, which always need more support: “Befriending services, legal advice, talking to people, handing out food and donations.” Be realistic about how much time you can commit and it will help focus your efforts.', 'In 2015, Gardner realised she wanted to go all in, and spent two months on the Greek island of Lesbos at the height of the refugee crisis. Together with an anarchist group, she helped with “bringing in boats, giving people a hot drink and dry clothes, directing them to the official refugee camp”. The scene was very mixed, politically – anarchists working with Islamic Relief, and maverick Kent mothers who had never done campaign work before. It was disorganised and imperfect: some people used these groups as a symbol of how useless the EU was. But in a way, part of the ad hoc movement’s success was that, in its spontaneous internationalism, it made plain what European institutions wouldn’t admit: this wasn’t a Greek problem, it was an us-problem. Besides, Gardner says, “How many more people would have just felt unwelcome, if we hadn’t done that?” This experience seeded Gardner’s attitude today, in her professional life: that however adverse the political context, the work she does never feels pointless. There is no such thing as wasted human connection.', 'People often think in binaries: are you political or altruistic? Are you a person in need or a volunteer? When truthfully, we are all of these things. It’s time to collapse the distinction between the helper and the helped, something addiction and prison services have known for years: there is no more effective support than that which comes from someone who’s been there.', 'Danny O’Donoghue, 53, is area manager of the Richmond Fellowship, a mental health charity, and describes some volunteers who previously suffered severe mental illness, and who now run a Hearing Voices group. “If you ever want to know total isolation, try hearing voices. Nothing is more alienating than something you can’t share. When clinicians ran these groups, they were poorly attended – sometimes the staff outnumbered the people. That never happens with volunteers with experience. I was struck by one saying, ‘The voices have always been the thing I hide, that I find some way to bury. The pleasure in this instance is being able to wear it as a uniquely qualifying asset, to apply it in support of someone else’s recovery.’”', '“Join a political party” is like the bromide of activism, not in the sense that it’s soothing, in the sense that it’s just so boring, a fire blanket over the spirit – especially the endless meetings. I never heard this as plainly expressed as by the Bernie Sanders campaigner Claire Sandberg, whose motto was, “Never have groups: it creates a tyranny of the annoying”; and her sub-motto, “Never have a meeting whose action is another meeting.”', 'If you want to see those principles in action, look at the most momentous movements of the recent past: Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion. Rupert Read, a co-founder, describes XR as “nothing like the Green party, it’s not a membership organisation. Anyone can act in the name of XR, provided they adhere to its values, principally nonviolence.” This has led to some “very unpopular actions – with XR, let alone with the public. But it shifted the conversation. Power conceded something to all of XR’s demands. I was there when we met Michael Gove, and the next day parliament put through a symbolic emergency climate motion unopposed. The last two years have been the best years of my life, finally being involved with something that was successful. But it’s not just about success.

Since the Covid lockdowns, however, Hodgson admits, it’s been “bonkers”. “We had 70 applications in April and May alone.”', 'It’s a pattern echoed across the UK, with communes reporting being inundated by new applicants of all ages, driven by the Extinction Rebellion movement and its focus on low-carbon living and, more recently, by the glimpse that lockdown has offered of simpler, less consumption-driven, lifestyles.', 'There are more than 400 such “intentional” communities across the UK. Many are cohousing set-ups, in which residents live in individual dwellings with a few common areas and domestic functions; others are based upon a lifestyle or worldview (spiritualism, gender non- binarism, veganism) and feature a variety of communal labour arrangements and facilities.', 'A surprising number are longstanding country communes, such as Bergholt Hall, founded in the heyday of the 1960s and 70s back-to-the-land and self-sufficiency movements. It was an era when an ideological generation of “diggers” (named after the 17th-century English communards) sought to challenge notions of the sanctity of the nuclear family and opt out of “the grab-game of straight society” (as hippy bible Oz magazine put it in a 1968 article on the first London digger commune).', '“Sixties and 70s communalism was a backlash against hi-tech postwar societies,” says Professor Luke Martell, who teaches a module on alternative societies at the University of Sussex. “These movements had a grand vision to change society, often along lines of economic communism, and rejected social norms such as monogamy and the concept of traditional childhood. Of course, with the failure of the communist states, these revolutionary ideas lost currency, even as the communities they gave rise to live on.”', 'Helen Jarvis, a professor of social geography at Newcastle University, sees the renewed interest in communalism as one expression of a “neotribalism”. “There’s a groundswell of common yearning for connectedness and for a sort of radical alternative,” she explains. “This is about housing, but it’s also about how people are choosing to eat and to form human connections. There’s a recognition that the lifestyles of the past are permanently broken.”', '“It was all about John Seymour [author of the 1976 bestseller The Complete Book of Self-Sufficiency] back then,” recalls Hodgson, who lived in London squats across London during the 70s. He later settled at Bergholt Hall, a 19th-century great house with a Queen Anne function room, wood and metalworking workshops, dairy, orchards, and shared kitchen, laundry and bathroom facilities.', '“We didn’t mind things being a bit rustic. Today’s generation, Thatcher’s kids raised with central heating in every room of the house, don’t expect our draughty corridors.”', 'It’s perhaps natural that there are tensions between old-guard communalists (typically referred to as “elders”) and those arriving to communalism in the wake of Covid, and as the climate crisis gathers pace. Long gone are the days when a rambling country pile could be bought for a few tens of thousands of pounds, and it can cost eye-watering sums to join a traditional rural commune. Many of the original communities, including Bergholt Hall, Canon Frome Court in Herefordshire and Postlip Hall in Cheltenham, require substantial capital buy-ins from new members (a unit for a single person at Bergholt Hall costs from £97,809). Despite popular conceptions, it’s not a fall-back option if times are hard.', 'Financial barriers mean that more than 50% of intentional communities fail within their first two years says Chris Coates, author of Utopia Britannica and a moderator of Diggers and Dreamers, a communal-living networking group that has seen a quadrupling of its membership since lockdown to 14,400 members.', 'Motivations have changed over two intervening generations. Today’s 20- and 30-somethings are more likely to talk of post-carbon living or permaculture, in which ecosystems are viewed as inextricably interlinked, rather than self-sufficiency or communalism for its own sake.', 'Arran Skinner, 21, has lived at Erraid, a farming commune in the Inner Hebrides, since 2018. He came to communal living out of a yearning to live close to nature and minimise his carbon footprint', '“Many of my friends were heading off to uni and I didn’t know what to do, so I came here as a volunteer and just stayed on,” he says.', 'Skinner believes many people in their 20s are excluded from communal living due to prohibitive costs, opting to travel between farms and communities as a Wwoofer (seasonal worker), or pitching up at of a handful of woodlands communities, such as Tinker’s Bubble in Somerset and Stewards Wood in Devon, where conditions are basic and residents live under constant threat of eviction. The Isle of Erraid, and its sister commune Findhorn on the Moray coast, are unusual in paying members for their community labour contribution in food and board.', 'A looming issue for enduring intentional communities is what Kirsten Stevens-Wood, who researches the subject at Cardiff Metropolitan University, refers to as “unintentional ageing”. Despite the original diggers’ hope of “automating out all drudgery, toiling and moiling… so every cat can do his or her own thing”, rural survival requires as much elbow grease today as it did in the 1970s.', '“All of the things that these communities were doing 30 years ago – digging vegetable patches, splitting firewood – are much harder when you’re still there doing them in your 70s,” Stevens-Wood says.', 'Findhorn, for example, has an average resident age of 55, and Bergholt Hall has taken to curating its intake to balance ageing residents with young families and, like other 1960s and 1970s-established communes, is exploring financial instruments to enable incomers with little access to capital to join the community, such as shared ownership and loans. This means that single applicants to Bergholt Hall who are in their 50s and 60s (who represent over half of approaches) are likely to be disappointed. But it also means “elders” tend to step back when it comes to decision-making by consensus. “There’s an awareness that new families are on their way in, and we’re on the way out,” Dave Hodgson adds.', 'Rory Hodgson, 43, is Dave’s son and grew up with his mother in “a typical semi in Ipswich”, but spent idyllic summers as a teenager at Bergholt Hall. As an adult, he found himself priced out of his father’s commune and now lives at Redfield, a housing co-op in Buckinghamshire established in 1978, where a 19th-century mansion and 17 acres of grounds and mature fruit orchards are owned in trust. Residents pay rent and dabble in organic farming, but typically work two to three days a week outside the commune to cover their outgoings. “Redfield isn’t about private ownership and what’s me and mine,” Hodgson says.', 'In his view, new recruits to communalism are more pragmatic than boomer diggers, such as his father. “Feeding yourselves from the land year-round with no money coming in like that 1970s fantasy is bloody hard work,” he says. “At Redfield the kids go to normal schools and we have paid jobs. These days there’s a desire to have the best of both worlds.”', 'Founding ideologies are not, however, fully a thing of the past. Tensions emerge in rural communes around fault-lines such as diet, says Jenny Pickerill, a professor of environmental geography at the University of Sheffield who has studied intentional communities around the world. “I’ve known of secret breakaway meat-eating groups in communes that are technically vegan or veg,” Pickerill laughs, adding that whatever their age British communards often exhibit what she terms a “deep green-ism” in comparison to their counterparts elsewhere.', 'Staci Sylvan, 42, a birth doula, lives in Heartwood, set up on the principle of non-violent cooperation. Heartwood is in Carmarthenshire, a region of Wales that’s historically attracted Britons keen to live alternative lifestyles, but where feelings can run high about English incomers. Sylvan welcomes a recent flurry of interest from younger would-be communards, many of whom, she says, have arrived at alternative living through Extinction Rebellion and climate camps. “I came to communalism through protest groups in the 1990s. When I first joined Heartwood I was in my 20s and would thrash about trying to change things in the commune. Now I accept all the compromises that this kind of living requires.”', 'Andrea Jones, whose PhD focused on intergenerational relations in communes, believes emotional literacy is the secret of older communes’ success: “For communal living to work, individuals need to put in the emotional labour: being tolerant of each other’s foibles, for example, and being willing to let go of petty grievances.” One reason spiritual communities such as Erraid thrive, says Stevens-Wood, is that they “have something that unites them and promotes considerate behaviour, whereas a wave of communes set up in the 1990s on purely ecological grounds collapsed, in many cases, into infighting”.', 'Bob Fromer, 78, lives at Birchwood Hall – a green and feminist commune in the Malvern Hills that was established in 1970 – with his partner Lynda Medwell, 70. Also a veteran of the 1970s London squatting scene, Fromer briefly set up his own community before joining Birchwood Hall in 1984 and loves Birchwood’s communal meals, views and the camaraderie on the monthly maintenance days, when they work on upkeep of the gardens and buildings. For Fromer, tolerance and “a robust constitution” are the requisite qualities in a successful communard. “We get a lot of applicants who need looking after, but we are not a therapeutic community, so we need members who are self-sufficient. If you’ve come from a nuclear family and can’t shake the privacy that comes with our way of living, or are very house-proud, it generally won’t work.”', 'Daniela Zapf says that Covid has redoubled her ambition to live in a large community. Born in Germany, she arrived at Findhorn aged 22 and originally planned to stay for a few weeks. Six years later she’s still there. Zapf lives in Bag End one of a cluster of wood-built homes in the Findhorn ecovillage site. “The best part for me is the bonds we have here, like these ancient tribal bonds, not quite family but something much more than friendship” she says, talking about what keeps her there as a young person with a biotechnology degree and the world ahead of her. “This is something I wouldn’t want to miss in my life in future, even if I leave here.”', 'A proposed Leeds-based urban cohousing project, Chapeltown Cohousing, is now working to make its members representative of the community, with rented units and quotas for minority groups, but diversity often proves difficult for rural communities, despite the lip- service many pay to opening out to BAME and less physically able members. Quite apart from capital and labour demands, there’s a cultural expectation to contend with, says Stevens-Wood. “You need a certain approach to life to live in a commune. At heart this is a white, middle-class dream.”', 'For all of the challenges, the applicants keep coming. Bergholt Hall is fielding hundreds of applicants for its two available units and Heartwood, Canon Frome Court and Redfield are currently closed to new applicants, although they are receiving inquiries from as far afield as Hong Kong. “Many will be disappointed,” says Chris Coates. “But some will break ground on new projects. That’s why we’ve called the community diggers and dreamers, we’ve always been a mixture of the practically minded and utopianists.”', 'Stevens-Wood hopes the growing interest in alternatives to nuclear family dwelling will prompt overdue changes to English housing policy, “so it’s less laser-focused on nuclear families and home ownership”. For Fromer, sharing labour and resources as a communard is as good for the planet as it is our sanity. “This is a much cheaper way of living that gives you the good life yet frees you up to work differently and work less,” he says. “Whether you’re 20 or 60, that’s a pretty good deal.”', 'Findhorn and Erraid are open to short stays.

He was quickly snapped up by the WHO’s Global Programme on Aids (later UNAids) in Geneva, where he worked from 1987 to 1992 as a technical adviser.

Two important new books by prominent American authors, both written before the result of the presidential election was known, should help to capitalise on the new spirit of cautious optimism by laying out bold but well-argued plans for accelerating action against climate change.', 'How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need by Bill Gates presents a compelling explanation of how the world can stop global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions effectively to zero. Gates and his wife, Melinda, are well known for their foundation’s tremendous work on improving health and tackling disease around the world, particularly in poor countries. It is this concern for the most vulnerable people on the planet that has meant Gates has occasionally appeared equivocal about climate and energy policies that he thought could undermine the fight against poverty and illness. However, this book lays out forcefully his understanding that the impact of climate change poses a far bigger threat to lives and livelihoods in developing countries – it is thwarting efforts to raise living standards because poor people, in every country, are the most at risk from droughts, floods and heatwaves.', 'Gates rightly emphasises the importance of improving the resilience of both rich and poor countries to current and future climate change that cannot now be avoided. But his book leaves no doubt that adapting to the impact is not a solution on its own – we must also eliminate global emissions of greenhouse gases.', 'His strategy for reaching zero emissions is laid out in a very straightforward way, using numbers to help guide the reader to the magnitude of the challenge. He notes that annual emissions of greenhouse gases before the Covid-19 pandemic were well over 50bn tonnes worldwide, and rising. Getting to zero within the next few decades will be no mean feat.', 'The book breaks down the sources of these emissions into a few broad categories – making things, plugging in, and getting around – and Gates knows how to frame issues in terms with which everybody should be able to engage, without dumbing down the material.', 'At its highest level, his strategy is simple: make power generation zero-carbon by replacing fossil fuels with renewables and nuclear power, and then electrify as much of our activities as possible. This works in theory, but creates significant challenges, such as how to manage the intermittency of supply from sources such as solar panels and wind turbines.', 'A key device used by Gates is to calculate the cost of clean alternatives relative to fossil fuels, and where they are currently more expensive, to quantify the difference as a “green premium”. He then explains how this premium can be reduced through innovation and government policies. The credibility of the strategy is strengthened by references throughout to technologies in which Gates is investing his own money, such as novel ways to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and then store it. He also acknowledges that his sincerity will be doubted by some because of his wealth and use of private jets, for instance. But I think readers will discover from his book that he is a serious and genuine force for good on climate change.', 'The only major concern I have is that in emphasising, correctly, the importance of rich countries reaching zero emissions by 2050, he appears to suggest that cuts in greenhouse gases over the next 10 years are less important. In fact, the amount of warming we face depends on cumulative emissions, so countries such as the US and UK need to be cutting sharply from now, and for the next 30 years.', 'Gates is also caught in the crosshairs in Professor Michael E Mann’s book, The New Climate War: The Fight to Take Back Our Planet, which criticises the 2016 edition of the billionaire’s annual letter, written with Melinda, for highlighting the challenges of cutting emissions and declaring “we need an energy miracle”. Mann, America’s most famous climate scientist, points out that many zero-carbon alternatives to fossil fuels are now cost-competitive with fossil fuels. He even suggests that, far from needing a miracle, we could achieve 100% clean electricity with current renewable technologies alone.', 'The main focus of Mann’s book is a call to arms in the new war against “inactivists” who are using new tactics of “deception, distraction and delay” to prevent the phase-out of fossil fuels. Mann is a robust character, and has fought off several disgraceful onslaughts against him and his work by climate change deniers in US politics and the media over the past 20 years. He warns that vested interests and ideological extremists who oppose efforts to eliminate fossil fuels no longer deny outright the reality of climate change because people can now see the evidence for it all around them. Instead, opponents of action now rely on slightly subtler arguments, and Mann reveals how they are sometimes unwittingly assisted by clumsy communications from climate scientists and campaigners.', 'He cautions against highlighting in particular the need for action by individual citizens and consumers. As important as personal efforts are, they can distract attention away from the critical role of governments and companies in making systemic changes.', 'Mann criticises the practice of flight-shaming climate researchers, because it creates the false impression that experts have to experience personal sacrifice and deprivation to be taken seriously, regardless of how successful they are in persuading politicians to act. Despite the attention devoted to it, flying is responsible for about 3% of annual greenhouse gas emissions.', 'Mann also attacks “doomsayers”, including some members of Extinction Rebellion, who claim that we have already passed the point of no return, condemning us all to imminent climate destruction. Such claims are not based on science and have the effect of making people give up on efforts to rid the world of fossil fuels.', 'Mann does not pull his punches, but his aim is usually strong and true. This book will no doubt prove controversial for some climate campaigners, as well as the deniers, but I hope it will be read by everybody who is engaged in making the case for action.', 'Both Mann and Gates appear optimistic that the world can stop climate change, but they are also under no illusions about the scale of the challenge we face and the many obstacles that lie in our way. They also show just how wrong those people are who think we cannot or should not succeed.', 'Bob Ward is policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on climate change and the environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science', 'How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need by Bill Gates is published by Allen Lane (£20).

And first he has some bones to pick with his fellow campaigners...', 'The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\xa0Learn more.', 'Bill Gates appears via video conference – Microsoft Teams, not Zoom, obviously – from his office in Seattle, a large space with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Lake Washington. It’s a gloomy day outside and Gates is, somewhat eccentrically, positioned a long way from the camera, behind a large, kidney-shaped desk; his communications manager sits off to one side. If one had to stage, for the purposes of symbolism, a tableau of a man for whom a distance of 3,000 miles between callers still constitutes too intimate a setting, it might be this. “As a way to start,” says Gates’ aide, “would it be helpful for Bill to make a couple of comments about why he wrote his new book?” It is helpful, and I’m not ungrateful, but this is not how interviews typically commence.', 'The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\xa0Learn more.', 'There is an urge towards deference, when speaking to Gates, which attends few other people of commensurate fame. Celebrity is one thing, but wealth – true, former-richest-man-in-the-world wealth – is something else entirely; one has a sense of being granted an audience with the Great Man, a fact made more surreal by his famously muted persona. The 65-year-old has the lofty, mildly longsuffering air of a man accustomed to being the smartest guy in the room, leavened by wry amusement and interrupted, on the evidence of past interviews, by the occasional peevish outburst – most memorably in 2014, when Jeremy Paxman questioned him about Microsoft’s alleged tax avoidance. (“I think that’s about as incorrect a characterisation of anything I’ve ever heard,” he said, practically squirming in his seat with annoyance.)', 'Unlike the Elon Musks or Larry Ellisons of this world, however, Gates is perceived to be sensible, uxorious, modest, vowing not to ruin his children with boundless inheritance or to waste energy trying to send things to Mars. In the late 1990s, the US government brought an antitrust suit against Microsoft, accusing it of maintaining a monopoly in the PC market; a final settlement in 2001 overturned an earlier order for the company to be broken up. Since then, Gates has enjoyed a reputation as the Good Billionaire, dispensing a fortune through his foundation and overshadowing what his detractors would say is his biggest shortcoming: his unquestioning belief in progress as a function of capitalist growth.', 'All of these aspects come together in Gates’ new book, How To Avoid A Climate Disaster, which, as he tells me, grew out of two things: his interest in the sciences and what struck him as an irresistible challenge – the fiendishly difficult problem of how to further global development while reducing emissions. For the past few decades, much of Gates’ focus has been on expanding access to electricity in the remotest parts of the world. “And yet,” he says, “the idea of adding new electricity capacity – you can’t just go build coal plants. And understanding how expensive it needs to be, and how this is going to work, had me doing a lot of reading.”', 'There’s another, greater obstacle to reaching zero emissions, which is the political challenge – part of which involves climate activists limiting their exposure to accusations of hypocrisy. Gates loves private jets; he calls them his “guilty pleasure”. He loves hamburgers and eating grapes year-round. A few weeks after we speak, it is reported that he is involved in a bid to buy Signature Aviation, which handles ground services for 1.6m private jet flights a year. Today he says, “I get sustainable aviation fuel that I use when I fly,” and mentions another, vaguely futuristic-sounding service: “I’ve paid to offset my carbon footprint – there’s this group Climeworks that does direct air capture up in Iceland.” On the subject of imported food, he says: “Well, growing food locally is often worse, because you’re putting things in greenhouses that have an insane climate imprint. I’m not the only one who eats out-of-season food, as far as I know. But if that’s people’s main objection and they’ll adopt my plan, then” – Gates smiles, in a rather glittering way – “I’ll cede my grape-eating.”', 'For Gates, this focus on grapes and private jet travel is, relatively speaking, like rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic. “What months of the year do I have to stop eating hamburgers?” he says sardonically. “I don’t need the tomato. Or the lettuce. Just the bun and the meat will do.” There is no suggestion that using “direct air capture” to offset one’s flights, were such a service even affordable for regular people, would make the slightest dent in the problem. But by using a private jet, Gates makes it easier for others to undermine him. It’s not, one imagines, the strongest tool in his skill set, to play dumb in order to win lesser mortals over.', 'Instead, what he does is bombard us with data and expertise. His book encompasses wisdom from sources that range from less well-known climate scientists, such as Vaclav Smil and Ken Caldeira, to John D Cox, author of Weather For Dummies, which, says Gates, remains one of the greatest books about weather ever written. Yet Gates’ book is compulsively readable. His ambition was to “cut through the noise” and give consumers better tools for understanding what works, an ambition he meets admirably. It’s more than that, however. Gates can get an audience with anyone, can marshal almost limitless resources, and is dogged in the detail. The result – particularly in the wake of the Trump presidency – is thrilling.', 'It is also, occasionally, comic. “I can’t deny being a rich guy with an opinion,” he writes, with a nod to the flip-side of his visionary status, that of the despised billionaire flogging a hobby-horse. And there is a nerdy bathos to some of his passions. In one episode, Gates takes his 15-year-old son, Rory, round a power plant on a family holiday, something he bills as a jolly day out. “I’m in awe of physical infrastructure,” he explains.', 'The depressing part of the book is its account of the challenge ahead, which Gates presents as extremely urgent – and, in order to avoid defeatism, also just about doable. He points to a headline figure: 51bn. This is the amount of greenhouses gas, in tons, emitted globally each year, which we have to get down to net zero by 2050. The first step towards this is understanding what we’re dealing with. “Let’s have more literate climate articles, so people can understand if it’s a breakthrough that’s a big deal or a small deal.”', 'For example, the transport industry, on which so much attention is focused, accounts for only 16% of global emissions – which is why, as air travel has ground to a halt, greenhouse gases have gone down by only around 5%. As Gates points out, the future of car travel lies in electric vehicles; but if the electricity comes from coal-fired power plants, the switch is of limited value. Cars are a minor part of the problem compared with the juggernaut of emissions generated by the global cement and steel industries.', '“Most people don’t understand what cement is,” says Gates, igniting with interest. “And I spent literally weeks understanding why it’s so miraculous, and could we use less of it?” The same goes for meat production. “To understand, OK, what is the ratio of the input of the calories of the cow to the output? What are cow genetics?” Cow burps and farts account for around 4% of global emissions; without striking beef from our diets, how can those emissions be offset or eliminated?', 'Like a lot of people, I’ve indulged in somewhat magical thinking around this, dutifully recycling my plastic every week while assuming that, when push comes to shove, the US government will devote the entire annual defence budget to climate control and invent a shield or something. And Gates covers some cool, sci-fi type innovations, most of them to do with those direct air capture technologies, which suck (not the scientific term) greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere. There is a solar-powered dehumidifier to get drinking water out of air, and a technology for storing heat in “molten salt”. There is geoengineering, which may one day be capable of reducing the amount of sunlight hitting the world’s surface by “distributing extremely fine particles” into the upper atmosphere or using a salt spray to “brighten clouds”. But these innovations are cripplingly expensive and imprecise. If you meddle with clouds over the US, there is no guarantee the temperature in China won’t go down.', 'The biggest gesture most powerful authorities are willing to make involves divesting from polluting industries. Last year, New York state pledged to divest its $226bn (£165bn) pension fund from fossil fuel companies. This strikes Gates as wholly inadequate; it diverts the focus from more urgent concerns, such as finding a carbon neutral energy source to power the electricity grid. “It’d be tragic to have this whole generation behind the cause, and then you just do the easy stuff like divesting securities. You can say, ‘OK, I don’t want any more of those evil oil company stocks. Yay!’ Well, how many tons [of carbon] did you avoid by doing that?”', 'The same goes for everybody vowing to eat less meat. “I mean, these are good things – in fact, buying Beyond Burgers [a plant-based “meat” company that Gates invests in] actually drives demand, which will get the quality up and the rate premium down, so consumer behaviour is important. But unless you replace steel, it’s a joke. Just forcing companies to report their CO2 is a good thing; but when you open that steel company report, you’re going to go, ‘Oh, this is shocking, they have emissions!’ And what? Are we not going to build buildings in India to provide people with basic shelter?', '“If this was all about a 20% reduction, it should be pretty easy. Rich countries could reduce our cars and big houses, and the ridiculous amounts of meat we eat by 20%. The thing that makes climate so hard is that it’s not about a 20% reduction – it’s about getting it to zero. So things like [changing] mass transit so you have 20% less miles driven in the city, that doesn’t go anywhere.”', 'The only thing that would neutralise the climate impact of public transport is if every vehicle were powered by a zero-emission fuel. One solution Gates cites is clean hydrogen. It doesn’t yet exist in a widespread usable form, but were the technology to advance to create “super, super cheap and totally clean hydrogen, that helps a lot of industrial processes. You could use that to make fertiliser in a clean way, to help make steel in a clean way. That alone would help with about 30% of emissions, which is pretty amazing – to have one thing that can do 30%.”', 'If there is a credibility gap in listening to Gates on this subject, it comes from the suspicion that he lives in a world so far removed from the rest of us as to raise large blind spots. It’s a small thing, but in a 2014 Rolling Stone interview, Gates mentioned a lunch with Charles Koch, the libertarian billionaire who made huge sums from the oil business and for decades lobbied to reduce US environmental regulations. “He’s a very nice person,” Gates said in that interview, “and he has this incredible business track record.” Koch, along with his late brother David, spent decades funding climate deniers. Gates’ regard for him seems vested entirely in his success as a businessman; no matter how philanthropic, at some level the billionaire class is loyal primarily to itself.', 'But there is no denying that Gates is alert to inequity. “It’s the rich countries that did all the emissions,” he says, “but it’s these poor countries [that will suffer]. The injustice of this on a global basis is pretty mind-blowing.” Still, he is often at odds with other climate campaigners, particularly those on the left. Of the Green New Deal, the proposal backed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that raises the goal of carbon neutrality in a decade, he is flatly dismissive. “Well, it’s a fairytale. It’s like saying vaccines don’t work – that’s a form of science denialism. Why peddle fantasies to people?” This seems a little harsh, and one suspects that Gates’ vehemence is powered by a broader disapproval of Ocasio-Cortez’s politics. But his point is that there isn’t the time, money or political will to reconfigure the energy industry in a decade; by encouraging an impossible goal, you doom yourself to short-termist measures that prove insufficient.', 'How helpful does he consider protest movements like Extinction Rebellion, with their habit of shutting down busy thoroughfares at rush hour? “Well, what we need is innovation. So if they’re really strategic about what street they cut off, and some poor guy is blocked in traffic and he sits there and says: ‘God, I’ve got to figure out a way to make steel [carbon neutral]. I was being lazy, but now that I’m sitting here in traffic, I’m going to go home tonight and figure how to do this.’ Then it’s a very direct connection between blocking the traffic and solving climate change.” He smiles sarcastically. “I don’t mean to make fun of it – in a way their passion is valuable. But it’s going to manifest in some ways that aren’t that constructive. So we need to channel that energy in a way that takes 51bn and moves it towards zero.”', 'And Greta Thunberg? “To some degree the resonance of the issue – if climate change wasn’t important, she wouldn’t be on the front page.” I quite like Gates for this. One can imagine him having a pop at Malala Yousafzai, too; popular sentimentality is not something that interests him. “I’m not trying to take anything away from her. And every movement needs iconic leaders who speak, and that’s a pretty good thing. But there’s probably some teenager who believes that the Rohingya should be treated better, and another who thinks we’re not investing enough in good education. So the world has sought her out to speak in this clear, almost innocent way about a cause that we’re trying to orchestrate our energy around, and say hey, can we maintain this and convince people to make sacrifices? And how big do these sacrifices need to be? So I’m glad: you can’t have a movement without high-visibility figures. I hope she’s not messing up her education. She seems very clever.”', 'Well, hang on, I say: you’re a college drop-out yourself.', '“That’s true. Teaching yourself stuff works very well for some people, and probably for her.”', 'Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard in 1975, to form Microsoft. For the next 20 years, he focused solely on building the company; by 1996, it had a market cap of $100bn. Gates, meanwhile, became the world’s richest man in 1995, a spot he held intermittently until he was bumped by Jeff Bezos in 2018.', 'It’s tempting to read the Gates aesthetic – plain, functional, allergic to anything not in service to his goals – as the key to his success, and at least as important as his coding genius. These days, according to Forbes, his personal fortune is around $120bn (£88bn). But it wasn’t until he turned 40, he says, that he started to think about philanthropy, even though it was always there in his upbringing. His father, Bill Gates Sr, was a lawyer who became instrumental in the setting up of the Gates Foundation. His mother, Mary, who worked on various charitable boards, gave a toast at Gates’ wedding to Melinda, saying, “From those to whom much is given, much is expected.” So yes, says, Gates, “The idea that the success of Microsoft is so much money for one individual – that giving that back to society in some constructive way might be something I might end up doing – slowly but surely dawned on me.” He was mentored in this by his friend Warren Buffett. Gates is still annoyed by something CNN founder Ted Turner said of both men, years ago, “claiming that we wanted to be higher on some wealth list. And honestly we weren’t hyper-focused on it.”', 'The subject of pandemics is one that has obsessed him for two decades, going back to the foundation’s initial $750m donation to the Gavi Vaccine Alliance in 1999 and culminating in 2014 when he gave a Ted talk on the international community’s failure to prepare for the next big outbreak. Gates has donated $100m to Covid research, and on CNN before Christmas, predicted that “the next four to six months could be the worst of the epidemic”. Will he wait his turn for the vaccine, like everyone else? “That’s right. I’m a healthy 65-year-old, and I’ll delegate it to the states. So probably in March or April, they will film me taking the vaccine.”', 'That he is filmed is important. Gates has become the focus for online conspiracy theories about how he “created” the virus, and is now using the vaccine to implant microchips. For months, he has been batting away these theories; in an interview with Reuters in January, he repeated with weary finality how “crazy” and “evil” it all was.', 'Does he think the vaccine roll-out in the US, which has been fairly chaotic, could have been better handled? “It’s incredibly complex, especially when trying to do so at the scale and speed required. For context, India’s campaign to give 400 million children the measles rubella vaccine took over two years with a full year of planning. National leadership is crucial: I am hopeful the incoming administration can help give that.”', 'Meanwhile, Gates points out that the experience of the pandemic bears “strong connections” to what will happen if we don’t address the climate emergency. “We rely on government to look out for the future, so that even if something unlikely shows up, people aren’t dying and the economy isn’t wrecked. And so for the pandemic, despite many people, including myself, saying that we ought to get prepared – literally the title of my Ted talk was ‘We’re not ready’ – the government let us down. And so with climate change: we want government to look ahead and do the right things.” It is a much more complicated landscape, in which the single most useful thing individuals can do, in Gates’ view, is to educate themselves, the better to judge the impact of various solutions. “There’s no simple thing like get a vaccine and the nightmare ends. You’re talking about replacing every steel and cement factory, everything you do with electricity and transportation, even food. It’s way broader, and the time to do these large-scale things is way longer.”', 'One of the more mind-blowing facts Gates shares in his book is that during the ice age the global temperature was a mere six degrees cooler than it is today; and when the dinosaurs were around, only four degrees hotter. So, as climate deniers love to say, what’s the big deal if things warm up a bit?', '“That was confusing me a little bit,” Gates says. “We have these huge ranges of temperature, there have been forests at the south pole, so hey, how bad can this be? But understand that it’s the rate of change; that the speed with which the CO2 is going up is so fast, that evolution can’t help. If this was happening over tens of millions of years, instead of 100 years, then the Earth could adjust.” He pauses to consider another terrifying detail. “The fact there is so much water in the Antarctic ice, and that it can raise the sea level by over 100ft – that is mind-blowing, too.”', 'If he were 30 years younger, would he consider not having kids? “Rich countries are worried about shrinking. So no, I wouldn’t say to somebody, please don’t have kids. We will make the world a reasonable place to live in and so kids will be fine.” He thinks for a moment. “It is weird that in 2050, I’ll be 95 years old. Will I live to see this play out, in terms of what works and what doesn’t work? This is why you have to engage the young.”', 'Gates’ method of engaging his children is in line with his own interests, which his son, Rory, now 21, passionately shares. (His daughters, Phoebe and Jennifer, are 18 and 24 respectively, and seem to have been spared the holiday day trips.) “The history of steel goes back some 4,000 years,” says Gates dreamily, and mentions again how much he loves concrete. Did Rory never complain about being dragged off to look at a factory? “He has a deep amount of curiosity,” says Gates. “There were a few – like going to the sewage plant – that were fairly smelly. Going to where they process garbage, and the factory where they make toilet paper and paper towels, that also had a bad smell. Although for both of us that was pretty interesting.”', 'Gates considers himself “naive about the physical world”, and is fascinated by how things work. “We’re both a bit like that. So it was like: how are things really made? This guy Smil [energy academic Vaclav Smil] writes all these books about this, such fascinating books, but they never sell. People just take the fact that you flip the switch and the light goes on for granted, and behind that are such unbelievable innovations. Likewise the creation of steel and how cheap all that stuff is. Seeing it directly, I highly recommend that. I want to see tours of steel plants go up dramatically.”', 'There is an assumption, I suggest, that anyone in Gates’ wealth category has a personal contingency plan: a secret rocket ship, say, or a fortified island, or at the very least, an extremely well-stocked bunker. “No, I don’t. In my lifetime, the weather will be worse, but it’s mostly at the equator. I’m not a survivalist.” Instead his version of survivalism is to fund innovation. “I’m putting money into carbon capture and nuclear fission. The [Gates] foundation does what we call adaptation work, which is improving seeds.” (This is so crops can survive drought and floods in the zones most affected by the climate crisis.) He is also investing in the development of batteries that could, for example, power Tokyo for three days if a cyclone knocked out the power. (It would cost $400bn.)', 'Is there any single area of innovation that, if we got it right, might save us? “The basic answer is no,” says Gates. The scale of the threat is so all-encompassing, so demanding of radical changes to transport, buildings, industry, land use and political will, that “there is no single breakthrough that can solve all those things”.', 'There are, he says, “a couple that are very high on the list”. If there is something talismanic about Gates, and the faith we have in our billionaires and geniuses to magic us out of this hole, he isn’t here to encourage it. “But if you only get the top ones on the list,” he says, with a kind of terrifying calmness, “you’re in deep, deep, deep trouble.”', 'Bill Gates’ How To Avoid A Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have And The Breakthroughs We Need is published by Allen Lane on 16 February at £20.

Deeper inside the tunnel the phone signal is weak or non-existent. Communication has become more sporadic as HS2’s eviction team has advanced.', 'However, the activists are still managing to get messages out saying they are safe and well, in good spirits and that the tunnel network is so far holding up. HS2 has not commented on operational details of the eviction.', 'Eleven days after the tunnel occupation began, the tunnellers continue to resist attempts to evict them, as they hope to raise the alarm about the climate emergency in general and the destruction of ancient woodland and the diverse flora and fauna, which they say the HS2 project is causing.', 'A comprehensive survey of the impact of HS2 on wildlife said the project would destroy or damage irreparably five internationally protected wildlife sites, 693 local wildlife sites, 108 ancient woodlands and 33 legally protected sites of special scientific interest.', 'HS2 disputes this, and says it is delivering an unprecedented programme of tree planting and habitat creation alongside the new railway, with 7m trees and shrubs to be planted between London and Birmingham alone. Economists and planners have also told the Guardian they believe the route will help create jobs away from London and ease some of the geographical inequalities in the UK.', 'One of the young activists not previously revealed to be in the tunnel is 22-year-old Nemo, who has shared a video message with the Guardian. When asked by another protester what her thoughts of the future are, she said: “At the moment my future is filled with Calvin [the nickname of one of the tunnels], crawling around and cuddles.”', 'She said: “I’m really enjoying life in the tunnel. It’s quiet, especially compared with the noise of London. I’m not from the city so I’m not used to all the noise. I’m not hungry. I’m eating loads and loads including some posh cheese last night.”', 'The activists planned carefully to ensure food and water supplies were in place in the tunnel before the eviction started, along with books to read and packs of cards. Battery packs to keep phones charged have been essential. Toilet arrangements vary slightly above and below ground. In the tree houses occupants climb higher up the tree with a bucket to urinate and then shout “urine” before tipping out the bucket. Below ground there is an arrangement with bailiffs that they will dispose of urine and faeces.', 'Before contact with the tunnellers became more difficult the Guardian spoke to Dan Hooper, also known as Swampy “We are very happy down here,” he said. “We’ve got a really good crew. We all click quite well. We’re having a lot of chats. We play cards when we’re not busy. There’s lots of solidarity down here. We have been working as a crew on this.', '“Last night we ate a jar of olives and have plenty of chocolate down here. The temperature is a constant 12 degrees so we’re never cold. I’m feeling quite positive about the whole thing.”', 'He described it as “absolutely outrageous” that what he said was the biggest deforestation since the first world war was happening at the time of the climate emergency. “Government is planning to restart the road-building programme we stopped in the 1990s … It’s just full steam ahead. The only thing that’s going to stop it is that these schemes are so unpopular. Actions like the tunnel protest are turning the tide and making the government aware that people aren’t going to stand for this sort of thing.”', 'Jimbino Vegan, 41, a musician, poet, writer, artist and activist, has experience both above and below ground on the anti-HS2 protest at Euston. He helped dig the tunnel and was one of a group of seven in the first treehouse to be evicted on the afternoon of 27 January after bailiffs moved in.', 'His involvement with working on the tunnel began when he was playing music near Euston at the end of last year. The weather was very cold and he discovered the tunnel was a good place to warm up. He soon got involved with helping with the covert digging project.', '“I’m surprised nobody knew what we were doing. People kept emerging carrying buckets of earth and covered in muck,” he said.

There’s a focus on methods and evidence, so I ask them what scientific data and methods they could use to predict how climate change might affect their own future. On top of teaching, I research climate change. Specifically, I’m trying to understand how global heating might affect rainfall systems in Africa.

His own carbon footprint is “absurdly high”, but writing the book made him more conscious of his responsibility to shrink and offset his emissions, which he says is “the least that can be expected of someone in my position”.', '“I am aware that I’m an imperfect messenger on climate change.

We’d loved our pub and club touring the UK and were so grateful for any chance to travel. We went on to play small clubs and early festival slots across Sweden, the Netherlands and France in a crappy old bus that smelled of diesel and had sad grey curtains. There were so many different kinds of milk. It was brilliant fun, as friends working together to get our music across to different cultures.', 'Before the euro, we’d have our per diem expenses in different currencies, exchanged by the tour manager as we crossed borders; if you needed cash for a drink or a guitar lead, it would be the breezy, easy “How many shitters?”, the catch-all currency of the road. It became even easier after 1999 when the euro papered over the continent. Journalists would ask if different countries’ crowds responded to our music differently, and we would describe the Spanish clapping en masse or counting down to the choruses; the Milanese enthusiastically waving their Nokias to capture sound snippets and take grainy jpegs. Everyone welcomed us Brits, and what fabulous places we played: an old bordello outside Lyon, the top of a volcano near Athens, communist-era sports stadiums in Germany, countless clubs and bars in the neon-lit heart of Europe’s endlessly exciting cities. In 1995, at the tiny Café de la Danse in Paris, both Françoise Hardy and Diana Ross (Madame Ross to us) came and held court after our Bends/OK Computer-era set.', 'Like Hamburg to the Beatles, Europe was crucial to our growth as a band. It allowed us to see ourselves untethered from our UK roots and to imagine a life in music that could reach audiences everywhere. We made enduring friendships, toured with musicians from Europe, and dived deep into its clubs, festivals, record stores and music labels.', 'In December 2018, I was lucky enough to play three sold-out shows with the brilliant young Belgian artist Tamino. The gigs were at the Ancienne Belgique, a largish venue in the heart of Brussels’ club and cafe centre. Tamino’s music takes in influences as wide as Jacques Brel and Tim Buckley, as well as the 90s Seattle scene and his Egyptian heritage. It’s been a privilege to work with him.

No visas, no carnet, just the freedom of music.', 'What will playing in Europe be like now, after Brexit? I spoke to several old friends who’ve had years of experience planning Radiohead tours. Adrian, our touring accountant, said it will be more clunky and expensive. Before Brexit, a carnet (a list of goods going in and out of the country) was just needed for Norway and Switzerland. Now it would be more like playing South America, where each country has its systems for dealing with “third countries” like us. Adrian said a £10,000 guitar would need a carnet that would cost about £650 plus VAT. The costs of travel and accommodation are already high, and the extra paperwork and expenses would rise quickly for a touring orchestra.', 'There’s also that ugly word, cabotage – the rights for transport movement – with trucks carrying the gear from the UK only allowed two drop-offs in the EU before having to return to Britain, making a multi-city tour impossible with a UK tour bus or truck fleet. Another of our accountants, Steph, assured me that we would have people to sort it all out, and sent me an email for an online conference about what Brexit means for the music industry: an opportunity to charge artists and touring productions for dealing with the shiny new red tape.

I’m worried for all the brilliant crew who have carried us as a band for nearly 30 years. They are our family on tour, many from Europe themselves, and need to be able to travel freely and work with companies across the world. All the incredible staging, sound and lighting companies from the UK that drive lots of the European festivals might find it that much harder to compete with EU alternatives. And the Dutch, German and French technicians we’ve used for decades might find it’s not worth the candle to work here.', 'What about the solo cellist who is going to play in Berlin for a couple of hundred euros, and sees her carnet will cost more than the fee? Will the promoter in Berlin think twice about the costs and hassle of booking her rather than an artist from the EU? What about a young violinist from Vienna who dreams of studying at one of the prestigious UK music schools, and now feels discouraged to tangle with Brexit’s “specialised expertise”? This is a tragedy of deferred dreams.', 'When I played those small shows with Tamino, I was helping unload the van in a small, quiet square in the humming multicultural LGBT heart of Brussels. I looked up at the sign, and saw that the square was called Place Jo Cox (or Jo Cox Plein in Flemish). It had been dedicated that September to the murdered Labour MP – she had loved to visit the club when she was living there, working for Oxfam and others. I can imagine her taking pot luck after work, dropping into the club to see what part of the world had come to town that night. I’m sure she’d have cheered on some new young British group, perhaps in the small club above the main hall, as I did when I nipped upstairs after soundcheck to watch a euphoric, soulful set by the Reading artist SG Lewis. I wonder if it would be as easy for those groups now.', 'It is time for the UK government to admit it didn’t do enough for the creative industries during the Brexit negotiations and look to renegotiate on the provision for touring in Europe. My country’s music is great because it scorns borders and boundaries; it is a great patriotic source, a force of confidence, joy and shared passions. I am proud of my country and all the music it has exchanged with the world, and I am sure that pride is felt across all ages and cultures in the UK.

When Hohn was revealed as XR’s single biggest donor, he said: “Humanity is aggressively destroying the world with climate change and there is an urgent need for us all to wake up to this fact.”', 'Hohn, who has only given a handful of tightly controlled media interviews throughout his career, pleaded with the high court judge overseeing his 2014 divorce from Jamie Cooper-Hohn to ban the media from the courtroom.', 'However the request was denied, giving the public a glimpse into the billionaire’s surprisingly modest lifestyle, his motivations for making so much money, and why he didn’t view his wife of 17 years as worthy of half the family fortune.', 'Although he was in a fight over a huge amount of money, Hohn said his life’s mission was to give money away. “My life is actually about charity,” he told the court. “I learned very early on you cannot take money with you. It does not bring you happiness.”', 'He said he lived a “very simple lifestyle”, avoids meat and practises yoga. On hearing the evidence, the judge noted that the couple lived a “Swatch lifestyle” not a “jet-set lifestyle”.', 'Hohn grew up in Addlestone, Surrey, the son of a Jamaican car mechanic and a legal secretary. He first decided to give money to charity, he has said, while working in the Philippines, where as a 20-year-old he saw children living on a rubbish dump.', '“I considered being a doctor and working in a caring profession,” Hohn, 54, told the court. “[But] a dream or aspiration without resources is just that.” He compared his ambition to become a philanthropist to other young people who set their hearts on being able to “play for Chelsea or be a top QC”.', 'Hohn studied accounting and economics at Southampton University, where a tutor suggested he go on to study for a masters in business administration at Harvard. He took their advice, and graduated in the top 5% of his class.', 'It was at a Harvard dinner party that Hohn met Jamie Cooper, who was studying for a masters at the John F Kennedy School of government. They married soon after and took each other’s names officially, but only Jamie used both surnames. They have four children, including a set of triplets.', 'Hohn worked for the private equity firm Apax Partners, before moving to the Wall Street hedge fund Perry Capital. Perry’s partners then posted him back to London where he ran the UK division.', 'He struck out on his own in 2003 setting up his own $500m fund TCI, which quickly attracted investment from some of the world’s top foundations and endowments including the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.', 'The fund appealed to charities and foundations because it was structured so that one-third of management fees would go directly to the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, a charity set up by the couple and run by Cooper-Hohn.', 'In an interview with the New York Times to promote the newly launched charity in 2008, Cooper-Hohn dismissed suggestions it had been set up as ploy to soften Hohn’s image as an activist investor unafraid to fight the boards of companies he had invested in.', 'In a new year card to family, Hohn once wrote he had had an “exceptionally exciting year overthrowing German CEOs”. One opponent – former Deutsche Börse boss Werner Seifert – was so angry after losing a boardroom battle with Hohn that he wrote a book about it entitled Invasion of the Locusts, where he described Hohn’s style as “poison”.', 'Hohn’s TCI was also instrumental in forcing Dutch bank ABN Amro into the arms of Royal Bank of Scotland in 2007 – a deal which just months later, when the banking crisis hit, was a key reason RBS had to be bailed out by the UK taxpayer.', 'Cooper-Hohn said the foundation “not about putting a warm and fuzzy face” on TCI. She said knowing that a share of the management fees went to the fund was “very much about keeping Chris motivated” to produce the highest returns possible.', 'Both TCI and the foundation flourished. The hedge fund now manages $30bn of investments and is regularly listed among the world’s best-performing funds. Last year’s mega payday was not that exceptional for Hohn. The previous year he was paid £200m, and accounts filed at Companies House for TCI Fund Management (UK) Limited, which is 100% owned by Hohn, show that it holds total shareholder funds of almost $2bn.', 'The charity holds almost $6bn of assets and gave away $386m in 2019, according to the latest available accounts. However, the foundation no longer collects one-third of TCI’s management fees, following the couple’s divorce. Instead, Hohn can give to the charity at his discretion.', 'The divorce reached the high court after Hohn refused to give Cooper-Hohn half of their assets, arguing that the extraordinary wealth he had generated constituted a special contribution to the marriage. He claimed she was only entitled to 25%.', 'Her lawyer said the marriage was “what most marriages are: a partnership. How can it be possibly be fair that a couple who have agreed how to run their lives together for the wife to only receive a quarter of the assets?”', 'After weeks of arguments – which included Hohn calling Goldman Sachs bankers “idiots” and describing former Spain and Chelsea striker Fernando Torres as “worthless” – the judge awarded Cooper-Hohn 36% – or $530m – of her former husband’s fortune.', 'Cooper-Hohn later won another court battle forcing Hohn’s CIFF charity to pay £270m to a charity set up by his ex-wife.']",['Rupert Neate'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/593ccdef561df8aea15481f6abd24b1f72d402d9/0_30_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'Sir Chris Hohn with singer Katy Perry'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4817df2d3fded45c60ec362d3d5981717d5f55a5/0_232_5315_3191/master/5315.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'An Extinction Rebellion protest by the elderly'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/624064aad18d3f334e582e432bfb550bd61abab2/0_44_1443_866/master/1443.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Jamie Cooper-Hohn'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f034c54b9302975ec51e1e24bdac700e9762699/0_166_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Werner Seifert, the former chief executive of the German stock exchange']]",

As legal challenges escalate, will Britain’s great traffic experiment be shut down before we have time to see the benefits?', 'On an overcast Saturday afternoon in December, a convoy of 30 cars, led by a red Chevrolet pickup truck, set off from the car park of an east-London Asda with hazard lights flashing. The motorists, who formed a “festive motorcade”, wore Santa hats as they made their way slowly through the borough of Hackney before coming to a halt outside the town hall a couple of hours later.', 'They had gathered to register their outrage at being the victims, as they saw it, of a grand experiment that has been taking place on England’s roads since the start of the pandemic. As the national lockdown eased last summer, swathes of Hackney, stretching from Hoxton’s dense council estates at the borough’s western border with Islington to the edge of the River Lea marshland near Stratford in the east, had been closed to through traffic.', 'Locals found their usual routes were shut off with little warning. Danielle Ventura Presas, one of the protesters, told me that she now struggled to get her disabled cousin to day care while also dropping off her two children at school on time. As we rolled through Clapton, another campaigner got out of her car and slowed the convoy to a walking pace, leading chants of “reopen our side roads!” on a megaphone.', 'The road closures formed part of a wider scheme to tackle London’s growing congestion problems. Between 2009 and 2019, miles driven on its residential streets increased by 70%, in part due to the rise of Uber, online delivery services and GPS technology. Air pollution, meanwhile, plays a role in the premature deaths of nearly 10,000 Londoners each year. When the pandemic arrived, this trend was briefly interrupted: the roads fell quiet, and the novelty of car-free streets encouraged more people to go out on their bikes. In May 2020, the government tried to capitalise on the bike boom by announcing the biggest ever investment in “active travel” – walking, cycling or scooting. The short-term aim of the fund was to make it easier for people to get around without using public transport. The broader vision – reducing reliance on the private car – was more radical.', 'In London, the Streetspace plan unveiled by mayor Sadiq Khan and Transport for London (TfL), demanded “an urgent and swift response” to the crisis. The strategy funnelled money from the government’s new active-travel fund to London’s boroughs for low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) and other projects to encourage walking and cycling, such as temporary cycle lanes and timed road closures outside schools. By the end of last year, there were about 100 in London, where they have been most widely adopted, but they are now being rolled out in Manchester, Birmingham and other cities.', 'LTNs block motor traffic from sidestreets with physical barriers such as planters or bollards, or with number plate recognition cameras at their boundaries which local authorities use to issue fines to drivers entering the zone. Residents inside LTNs can still drive to their home, but they may have to take a longer way round. The theory is that by reducing the amount of road space for cars, people will find other ways to make short journeys. (In London, almost half of car journeys are less than 2 miles.) That means more walking and cycling, which ultimately means less pollution, less congestion, quieter, safer streets and healthier citizens.', 'Critics of LTNs say closing sidestreets increases congestion elsewhere, but early monitoring of new LTNs in Hackney and Lambeth found that traffic on main roads hardly increased at all. Data from established LTNs in Walthamstow showed the opposite, although transport academic Rachel Aldred suggests that it is hard to draw conclusions about the specific impacts of these schemes as traffic in the area was rising more generally at the time.', 'Enthusiasm for LTNs brought about a rare consensus between the Conservative government and the Labour mayor of London, as well as Greens and pro-cycling groups. But an opposition also sprang up, bringing together an equally unlikely alliance of anti-gentrification activists, professional drivers, Labour and Conservative backbenchers, local councils, motoring lobbyists and a raft of new grassroots campaigners who shared their outrage on neighbourhood Facebook groups. On social media, each side conjured up its own vision of life in low-traffic neighbourhoods: one a utopia of families cycling happily together on quiet streets, with children wobbling out in front; the other a nightmare of permanently congested roads, with emergency vehicles snared in the gridlock.', 'The protesters in the Hackney motorcade stressed that they had only brought their cars in order to respect social distancing and allow disabled people to participate. But the exuberant procession of cars, with their horns honking and engines revving, seemed to suggest something bolder: motorists reasserting their right to take up space on urban streets.', 'Several cars in the motorcade had cabbage leaves lodged under windscreen wipers or taped to their doors, a reference to one of the most bitter exchanges in the conflict. Over the summer, Hackney’s cabinet member for transport, the Liverpudlian Jon Burke, had become a hate figure for opponents of LTNs after he responded to tweets which called for him to “go home” by tweeting: “If it wasn’t for immigrants, ‘born n bred’ Londoners would still be eating cabbage with every meal.”', 'For anti-LTN campaigners, who sometimes caricature cycling advocates as a privileged elite, this was incendiary provocation. “What he’s having a go at is the white working class,” said Niall Crowley, one of the organisers of the protest. “That’s really incensed people.” In September, Burke received a handwritten death threat, and at the start of this year, he announced he would resign as a Hackney councillor in order to stand in his home city’s mayoral race. A newsletter issued by the Hackney protesters proclaimed his departure their victory.', 'After the UK’s first lockdown ended in July, the traffic soon returned and talk of the government’s promised “cycling revolution” faded, while some objectors continued to vandalise its remnants. In Hackney, the new street signs were spray painted, and someone cut the cables on an expensive new traffic enforcement camera. In Ealing, bollards were removed one night and the holes they left behind filled in with concrete. Meanwhile, opponents of the mayor’s walking and cycling plans have pursued numerous legal challenges to the new policies.', 'Burke told me LTNs were just one part of a complete reimagining of the borough’s public spaces for a low-carbon future. “We’re introducing huge amounts of cycle storage, the largest electric vehicle charging programme in the country, and we’re massively improving the quality of our public realm with the largest tree planting programme in Europe. I get emails from people saying ‘you’re the most hated man in Hackney’,” he said. “And I want to have a dialogue with those people, but I’m not going to tell them there’s a solution to the problems we face that allows them to continue driving to the same extent they were previously.”', 'The next few months will be decisive, as councils push for temporary schemes to become permanent, and objectors fight for the right to drive wherever they need to go. London’s great traffic experiment hangs in the balance.', 'For many Conservative voters and MPs, the party’s apparent shift from championing the car to promoting bikes is cause for alarm. In May 2020, Boris Johnson, himself a committed cyclist, announced a new “golden age” for cycling, as part of the Conservatives’ broader “green industrial revolution” strategy. This stated aim to reduce transport emissions – which was somewhat undermined earlier this month when Johnson announced his intention to cut taxes on domestic flights – has created an internal schism in a party that has traditionally represented the motorist’s interests. “Motorists did not vote for the Green party in the general election. But that is what we’ve got,” Howard Cox, the founder of the pro-driving campaign FairFuelUK, told me by email.', 'As polling shows, people tend to like green policies in theory but less so when they are the ones being inconvenienced by them. Last year, a YouGov study found that the average British person was “an environmentally concerned recycler, who takes their own bag to the supermarket but also likes their meat, and balks at the thought of paying more tax to fund policies for tackling climate change”.', 'After Conservative-controlled Kensington and Chelsea council removed a major cycle lane just seven weeks into its trial period, the Daily Mail reported that the prime minister’s transport adviser, Andrew Gilligan, called the council to let it know Johnson had gone “ballistic” at its decision. Gilligan, who worked with Johnson at the Spectator and later served as cycling commissioner during Johnson’s second term as mayor of London, has been instrumental in pushing the Tories to invest record sums in walking and cycling, according to several interviewees working in the transport sector.', 'During his stint at City Hall, Gilligan gained a reputation for his “hard-nosed” operating style. “When we agreed, it was great, it was going to move forward very fast, there would be no obstacles in his path,” said Simon Munk, an infrastructure campaigner at the London Cycling Campaign. “But when you disagree with him and you become one of those obstacles, it’s quite a full-on experience.” Gilligan has shown the same single-mindedness at No 10. In May, when the Department for Transport invited all councils to bid for a fund to create temporary walking and cycling schemes, one of the conditions of the first wave of funding was that schemes had to be in place within 12 weeks.', '“The problem we’ve ended up with is because boroughs have been encouraged by the government to introduce them at such speed,” said Caroline Pidgeon, a Liberal Democrat member of the London assembly and a longstanding member of its transport committee. “People feel it’s being done to them rather than feeling like they’ve been brought along.”', 'A government spokesperson said: “We want to ensure people have more opportunities to choose cycling and walking for their day-to-day journeys, as part of our wider plans to boost active travel – benefitting both the nation’s health and the environment. That’s why we have committed a significant £175m to create safe spaces for cycling and walking as surveys and independent polls show strong public support for high-quality schemes.”', 'Among the many dissenters to the introduction of LTNs across the country are 14 Tory MPs, who signed a letter in November to the transport secretary Grant Shapps, calling on the government to “stop the uncalled-for war on the motorist” and withdraw “the blockades and dedicated cycle lanes eating into our town and city roads”. The spectre of the “war on the motorist”, in which the longsuffering driver is constantly thwarted in his efforts to get around, while being made to pay more and more for the privilege of doing so, has been with us since at least the 60s, despite having little basis in fact.', 'In 2011, the coalition government declared an end to the conflict, promising to quell “Whitehall’s addiction to micromanagement”. Unsurprisingly, that wasn’t the end of the story. Earlier this year, a Telegraph editorial called on Conservatives to once again take a stand against Sadiq’s Khan’s war on cars.', 'The MPs’ letter was organised by the campaign group FairFuelUK, which works with mostly Conservative politicians in an all-party parliamentary group, arranging meetings with motoring campaigners and planning political actions. “Backbench Tories have told me they’re uncomfortable with the government’s focus on the privileged cycling few,” said Cox. “The prime minister and his Lycra-clad advisers are out of touch with economic reality and majority opinion.”', 'Niall Crowley, the Hackney roads protester who will stand as a candidate in council byelections in Hoxton East and Shoreditch, agrees. Frustrations about low-traffic neighbourhoods, he told me, are really about the fact that people resent top-down decision-making and feel excluded from local democratic processes. “Everything I read, it’s ‘we’re doing this and you have to get used to it’. If you’re going to treat residents as a problem to be managed or nudged, then what kind of democracy is that?”', 'In September, a group of black cab drivers and their supporters gathered outside City Hall in London to accuse mayor Sadiq Khan of “destroying London”. A campaigner gave a speech on the concourse outside the mayor’s office, grimly predicting that the black cab’s days were numbered if road closures were not reversed. “This is the endgame,” he told the crowd.', 'During the summer, TfL had barred taxis and other private vehicles from Bishopsgate, an ancient road that takes its name from the defensive wall built by the Romans around the city. The road runs past Liverpool Street station and into the financial district; cars, cabs, buses and cyclists compete for space. Cab drivers were also angry about TfL’s decision to exclude them from some central London bus lanes, which they can ordinarily use to drive around the city more quickly. They also protested about about losing access to other main roads under restrictions that allow only buses, cyclists and emergency vehicles to pass through.', 'Although taxi drivers have been the vanguard of the resistance to Khan’s active travel plans, Steve McNamara, the chair of the Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association, said cabbies were not always opposed to new cycle lanes. “It’s much less stressful for them if they’re driving their cab and the cyclist is in a nice segregated lane next to them,” he said. “But what we don’t support are these ones that are banged in with very little planning, that look like they’ve been designed on the back of a fag packet.”', 'In interviews, McNamara repeatedly returns to a theme that cyclists are a privileged minority making life more difficult for working-class drivers in the suburbs. “If you can afford to live centrally, and you’ve got a well-paid job in the city or central London, it’s great for you to be able to ride to work,” McNamara said. “But equally if you live in the suburbs, as most Londoners do, and you have to get the bus to work, or you’re driving a lorry, it’s not so good.”', 'Some of London’s suburban boroughs, which are less well served by public transport and have higher rates of car ownership, have embraced new cycling and walking schemes, and received £30m from City Hall to become flagship “mini-Hollands”. But others remain resistant: in Barnet, councillor Roberto Weeden-Sanz said the Conservative group would take a stand against the “war on drivers” by refusing to implement LTNs. Barnet has a proud history of opposing traffic reforms: in 2003, the council’s environment committee chair Brian Coleman ordered the removal of 1,000 speed humps in the borough. A triumphant Telegraph column compared Coleman to Winston Churchill and Field Marshal Montgomery.', 'There is no evidence that LTNs disproportionately benefit the better-off. A new study has shown that, contrary to one of the most common objections, road closures have not shifted traffic from wealthier areas into more deprived ones. Polling in London has repeatedly shown that more people support LTNs than oppose them. Burke, the former Hackney councillor whose comment about cabbage enraged his opponents, believes that car reduction advocates shouldn’t be afraid of arguments over class. “What I’m not willing to do, as someone who comes from a working-class background, is cede an inch of ground to people who have tried to make this a class issue,” he told me. “Seventy percent of the households in Hackney don’t own cars, so why should cars own 100% of the roads? LTNs are an exercise in redistribution.”', 'But statistics have not dispelled a popular narrative that car reduction measures are unwanted policies imposed by the “metropolitan elite” on the poor. McNamara is eager to frame car reduction measures as a class war. “And let’s be honest – the working classes are losing badly,” he said.', 'McNamara is playing on familiar stereotypes. In the 2010s, the folk figure of the hipster had three essential characteristics: a beard, a love of artisan coffee and a fixed-gear bike. The urban cyclist does not cause gentrification, but he becomes a powerful symbol of it. He is able to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing urban environment in a way that established working-class communities are not. He is also visible in a way that the structural causes of the housing crisis are not. As such he – and his bike – have become a focus for anger about inequality and displacement.', 'In his study of cycling culture in the San Francisco Bay Area, the geographer John Stehlin did not find a causal link between bike lanes and gentrification. But he argued that initiatives to make streets more livable, while often motivated by progressive ideals, also became useful marketing tools for developers of high-end housing.', 'However, Mohammad Rakib, a community activist in the borough of Tower Hamlets, which borders Hackney to the south and has the highest poverty rates in London, believes LTNs play a more active role in attracting middle-class newcomers to deprived areas and squeezing out the long-term working-class residents. “These policies are more about social cleansing than they are about reducing pollution,” Rakib told me.', 'Rakib sometimes makes memes depicting cyclists as “urban colonialists”, combining cycling helmets with the imagery of empire. His point that the users of bike lanes do not reflect the diversity of areas like Tower Hamlets, however, is undeniably true. In 2019, according to TfL research, 85% of cyclists on TfL’s cycle routes were white.', '“These areas and communities have waited generations for this level of investment,” he said. “Now that money has been made available, it is not being spent as the community have been asking for it to be spent. LTNs suit a certain class of people who are by no stretch the majority within these areas.”', 'Cycling hasn’t always been seen as the preserve of the metropolitan elite. In the mid-20th century, the bicycle was a primary mode of transport for the working class, while the motorcar remained unaffordable to most. In his celebratory 1949 work Leisure (Homage to Jacques-Louis David), the French artist Fernand Léger depicted a gang of workers taking a trip out of the city on their bikes – a vision of the labour-saving potential of the humble bicycle. That same year, 37% of all journeys in Britain were cycled, according to Carlton Reid’s book Bike Boom. From that peak, the figure has fallen to about 2% today.', 'The mid-20th century is a “what if?” moment, where one possible future was blotted out by the ascendancy of the car. In the 1930s, the government planned to vastly expand a national network of cycle routes as well as create a new system of motorways. Both were delayed by the war, and in the end government prioritised the motorways. From the 50s onwards, car ownership became an aspiration of the middle classes and a symbol of a new age of affluence. By the 60s, Britain had become a “car-owning democracy”, in the words of Simon Digby, the MP for Dorset west at the time.', 'As cars became more common, so did congestion and pollution. In response, in the 60s transport minister Ernest Marples introduced a raft of new driving restrictions, including yellow lines and parking wardens. Marples said in 1964 that an enraged motorist had once thrown one of his new parking meters through his drawing room window. “I am accused of declaring war on the motorist,” he said in a 1963 speech to the Passenger Transport Association. “That is a complete travesty of the truth.”', 'During the 70s, concerns about the environmental impacts of the car grew, particularly around emissions from leaded petrol. By the time Margaret Thatcher announced that her government would oversee “the largest road building programme since the Romans” in 1989, a growing ecological movement responded with a series of militant actions, among them a protest camp on the site of the planned M3 expansion at Twyford Down in Hampshire. Almost a year later, the camp was evicted and the motorway was built.', 'Out of this anti-roads scene came a group called Reclaim the Streets, which crashed into public consciousness in May 1995 with a daring piece of street theatre. At a busy traffic intersection in Camden in north London, two cars driven by activists collided. Their drivers got out and began to argue. The argument escalated until both drivers took out sledgehammers and smashed up the cars, creating a DIY barricade and allowing other members of the group to set up a sound system and a children’s play area, turning the busy high street into a carnival. The group, which was immersed in 90s rave culture and the movement against the 1994 Criminal Justice Act, went on to hold dozens of similar events all over the UK.', '“A year after we were being branded as terrorists, Islington council organised a very similar party to the one we’d hosted,” said one former activist Roger Geffen. “This idea that you should close city streets to motor vehicles and open them up to people – it was already starting to go mainstream.” When I asked Chris Knight, a former Reclaim the Streets activist, about the group’s philosophy, he said: “It was quite simple: kill the car! A car just captures so much: private ownership, privatised space, isolation, egocentrism, deafness to the world around you. ‘Kill the car’ was just beautiful.”', 'This group of anarchists and radicals wanted to take back space from cars and promote walking, cycling and public transport for everyday use – the same ideas that would resurface 25 years later among the policies of a Conservative government. Geffen, now director of policy at advocacy group Cycling UK, exemplifies the way car reduction policies have gone from a fringe belief to the mainstream: his march through the institutions took him from illicit raves and squatting to Buckingham Palace, where he received an MBE for services to cycling in 2015. “It’s been an interesting trajectory,” he said.', 'On a September evening between lockdowns, I watched a cricket match happening in the middle of Rye Lane, a narrow high street in Peckham, south-east London, which used to be choked with traffic until it was closed to cars by Southwark council in July. A makeshift wicket was set up outside a local institution, Khan’s Bargains, and people spilling out of bars jostled for a chance to bowl. It was exactly the sort of creative use of public space that Reclaim the Streets wanted to inspire, and a rare moment of genuine collective joy.', 'Will we look back on the past year as another “what if” moment, a bold but ultimately unsuccessful attempt to reduce the car’s domination of our roads and cities? By the winter of 2020, more than 30 councils across the country had withdrawn or scaled back new traffic-reduction schemes in the face of opposition. Some of these projects were only ever intended to be temporary, but TfL and the boroughs had stated their ambition for new bike lanes and LTNs to become permanent if the data showed they were working effectively.', 'In December, a few days after Kensington and Chelsea council announced it would scrap a new cycle route along Kensington High Street, a group of Extinction Rebellion activists and cycling campaigners gathered in an attempt to stop the removal of the lane. Wearing hi-vis jackets and carrying placards, a small group of protesters climbed on to construction vans and prevented the workers from pulling out the bollards separating cyclists from the traffic on the busy east-west road. Donnachadh McCarthy, the founder of the Stop Killing Cyclists campaign, told me the group had held protests here before to commemorate cyclists killed in the surrounding area – 15 people have been seriously injured while walking or biking along the high street itself in the past three years – but this was the first time his group had used such militant tactics.', 'The following night, after a second protest was dispersed by the police, the council succeeded in removing the bollards. A few weeks later, the route was still busy with cyclists, who now mingled with buses, taxis and high-performance cars. The scars where the bollards used to be were still visible on the asphalt.', 'The recent reforms suffered another blow in January, when Mrs Justice Beverley Lang ruled that TfL had acted unlawfully in using emergency measures to introduce changes to road layouts. The judge ruled that the process behind the decision to exclude taxis from Bishopsgate and the overarching Streetspace plan were “seriously flawed” and did not recognise the “special status” of taxi drivers.', 'The ruling also found TfL had not sufficiently researched or mitigated the potential adverse impacts of Streetspace projects on taxi passengers with disabilities. Transport for All, a charity advocating for accessible transport, found many disabled people felt “their concerns [about LTNs] have been ignored, creating feelings of anger and frustration”. However, the organisation has pointed out that traffic reduction schemes do not necessarily need to be scrapped, but rather modified with features such as tactile paving and exemptions for disabled drivers.', 'TfL points out the ruling did not make any direct findings on the lawfulness of low-traffic neighbourhoods, but with the legality of the Streetspace plan itself in doubt, some councils are worried the judgment could have a wider impact. While most schemes remain in place pending TfL’s appeal, Sutton and Croydon councils have withdrawn LTNs. Sutton council said in a statement: “Some schemes were working well, but we have no choice given the legal judgment.” In June 2021, a separate set of judicial reviews will challenge the future of active travel schemes in the boroughs of Lambeth, Hounslow and Hackney.', 'With TfL on the back foot in Kensington, cycling advocates have called on the mayor to use his statutory powers to take back control of the high street from the council. At the cyclists’ protest in Kensington in December, the transport historian Christian Wolmar said that the borough’s bike lanes had long been the site of a broader power struggle over the future of the city. As police officers hovered and tried to disperse the protesters, Wolmar recalled the council scrapping cycle lanes in Kensington and Chelsea more than 30 years ago, amid a wider conservative backlash against the leftist policies of the Greater London council, which included an early attempt at a London-wide cycle network. I asked how he felt about having the same arguments 30 years on. “Everything we know about urban planning shows that cities that give themselves to car dominance become less pleasant places to live. Who would want to live in Los Angeles if you could live in Copenhagen, for Christ’s sake?”', 'Across Europe, increasingly radical car-free policies have been met with vocal opposition. In Paris, a major pedestrianisation scheme faced a protracted court battle (which the scheme ultimately won), while Berlin’s pop-up bike lanes launched during the pandemic faced a legal challenge from the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party.', 'But when I asked Wolmar if he thought the backlash in London could kill the city’s car reduction plans, he was confident it would not. “They’ll win a few battles,” he said, “but they’ll lose the war.”', 'This article was amended on 25 March 2021. Mention of a 1939 government cycling plan was corrected; some national cycle routes were in place before the war.

Taking away protest is taking away human rights.”', 'There was little sign that the movement was losing momentum despite a week of largely negative headlines and mainstream denunciation. “Bristol is the Portland of England – I used to live there so I know,” said another protester, Pomona Lake, referring to the liberal city in the US state of Oregon. “It’s small and quite chilled but it’s got morals, and if you get us angry we will do something about it.”', 'As the night wore on, riot police forcibly dispersed another large sit-down protest outside Bridewell police station, half a mile away.

Shocking footage of a burning police van led to almost universal condemnation from politicians including Priti Patel, Keir Starmer and the Labour mayor of the city, Marvin Rees.', 'Yet a week later protesters believe their side of the story of that momentous night has still not been fully told. Avon and Somerset police announced that 40 of its officers had sustained injuries in the first protest on 21 March. Most seriously, it said that two had broken bones, and one of them also had a punctured lung – yet by the end of the week, the force had admitted that this was not true.', 'What is still not known is how many in the crowd were injured. A first aider on duty during the demo told the Observer that he personally treated six protesters, including people with bleeding head wounds, serious bruising and eye injuries. The first aider, who asked not be named, said he was also struck repeatedly with a baton. “I told the policeman I was a first aider but he continued beating me,” he said. “I had to go to hospital and I now need weeks of physiotherapy.”', 'Worse was to come in the view of the protesters. On Tuesday the city’s large community of van dwellers and travellers set up a protest camp. The policing bill will introduce a new criminal offence of living in a vehicle without a landowner’s consent and will give the police more powers to remove roadside encampments. Riot police cleared the camp in the evening and arrested 15 people for allegedly breaching Covid regulations.', 'Although no arrests were made for violent offences, many witnesses told the Observer they had seen people being struck by shields and pushed over while they were walking away from the camp.', 'The city’s former lord mayor, Cleo Lake, who is the Green party candidate for Avon and Somerset police commissioner, has called for an independent inquiry. “There’s been a complete shift from the policing we had last year [during the BLM protest in the city] to the policing we have now,” she said. “We need to look at it in the round. We’ve heard about the police that were injured – and nobody wants anybody to be injured – but we haven’t heard about how many protesters have been injured.”', 'An NHS worker on duty that night [Tuesday] told the Observer that no officers were treated in the hospital designated for the police, whereas the hospital designated for protesters was inundated with injured people. The worker, who also asked not to be named, said: “Over the course of the night the hospitals that were taking protesters filled and the hospital taking police did not see a single officer.”', 'Avon and Somerset Police said officers used force on Tuesday after protesters refused to disperse in spite of being told they were flouting Covid rules. The force added that officers were abused and attacked on the Sunday protest. Supt Mark Runacres said the crowd threw items including bottles and bricks at officers on Friday. “Officers repeatedly encouraged people to disperse but once the atmosphere changed and people became physical, it was necessary to take action,” he said.', 'For many in the city, the bill feels like a direct assault on their hard-won rights and alternative ways of life – at a time when lockdown makes it much harder for people to make their voices heard. An estimated 200 to 400 people live in vehicles in Bristol, making it one of the largest communities of “van dwellers” in the country.', 'While some of these are artists and musicians who enjoy the freedom of life on the road, many are low-paid workers priced out of homes in the city. They include people who want to live in a low-impact, more sustainable way as well as homeless people escaping life on the streets.', 'Yet there are growing fears that Bristol’s van dwellers may be hounded from roads and laybys under the proposed powers in the bill.', 'Rhiannon Craft, co-founder of Vehicles for Change, which represents van dwellers in the city, said they had no choice but to take to the streets over the bill.', '“Many of us feel we’ve got to protest because otherwise our way of life is going to be completely outlawed. It’s our last hope – our last resort. What else can we do?”', 'The number of young people living in vehicles is thought to be increasing as rents remain high. Michael Truesdale, who lives in a Transit van, said he was worried he may lose his home if the bill is passed. “I live in a van and I’m worried that soon I won’t be able to – I’ll be getting fined or imprisoned just for doing it,” he said. “But I would never have got into this lifestyle if rents weren’t so unaffordable for people like me.”', 'The bill contains measures that will have a direct impact on movements that have been nurtured in the city, such as Extinction Rebellion and Black Lives Matter. The bill will allow the police to impose far-reaching restrictions on protests, such as maximum noise levels and start and finish times. The home secretary will be able to define the point at which a protest becomes seriously disruptive, when the police can intervene.', 'While XR did not organise the recent protests, many of its supporters joined the marches. Colin Davis, a professor at Bristol University who has been part of Bristol XR since its beginnings, said there was a great deal of concern in the group. “The bill has been drafted to outlaw the kind of disruptive protest that is our modus operandi,” he said. “But we need disruptive protest because we are sleepwalking into catastrophe.”', 'The bill also contains a new offence of damaging a statue, which could have landed the BLM protesters who pulled down the Colston statue with 10-year sentences. Lake said a generation of young people in the city had experienced the power of collective action during the BLM protests last summer and saw the bill as an attempt to prevent it ever happening again. “Like it or not, they feel they made worldwide change last year,” she said. “Their right to protest like that is under threat, so of course they are going to challenge it.”', 'Lake, who grew up in the city, added that Bristol valued the right to protest, which stretched back into its history. “I’m a woman of dual heritage. I’m black. I’m white. I was taken on demonstrations by my white mother from the age of about six in Bristol – it’s always been there,” she said. “The city has a revolutionary, creative spirit.”', 'One of the city’s foremost scholars of modern urban riots, Roger Ball, a research fellow at the University of the West of England, said Bristol wasn’t unique but a culture of resistance had built up there over the past 20 years.', '“There is a culture of protest here that goes back to the 2010 student protests,” he said. “In this city people are much more likely to take direct action, such as blocking roads. The pulling down of the Colston statue is a good example. They solved in 20 minutes a problem that had been around for 100 years.”', 'This article was amended on 31 March 2021 to insert an additional reference to “Tuesday” so that, in relation to the NHS worker who was on duty “that night”, it is clear that it was a reference to the night of Tuesday, 23 March 2021.

https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/mar/31/sam-lee-the-nightingale-singer,"['Sam Lee built a studio in a wood, found a nightingale to sing with, hooked up a backing band, and livestreamed their concerts. But it is a race against time – for the song of the nightingale may soon be lost for ever', 'Building your artistic life around duetting with a rare bird that only sings at night for six weeks each year might seem a quixotic quest. But for Sam Lee, folk singer, song collector and environmental activist who has now written his first book, singing with nightingales is, like folksong, “a language of connectedness and enchantment”.', 'This spring sees the publication of Lee’s book, The Nightingale, alongside a daunting schedule of concerts where the singer dives into the spinneys of England with guest musicians and a small audience to collaborate with the most celebrated of British birds. “I’m there as the agent for the nightingale, to bring people to his thickets to pay our respects,” says Lee from his home in London. “It’s a journey into how to immerse into nature and be outside in the night-time, which doesn’t happen enough in our lives. And it’s a way of actively putting out gratitude for what we have and what returns – what creatures make it home.”', 'The nightingale, as Lee’s book about the bird eloquently explains, is feted not only in British culture but wherever it is found. There are 570 folk songs with the bird in their title, more than any other species apart from the blackbird. The everyday blackbird might make more obviously beautiful music, thinks Lee, but the singing male nightingale (the females don’t sing) is unrivalled because it sings at night and its song is so sophisticated. A blackbird makes 100 different sounds; a nightingale delivers 1,500, and arranges them in more than 250 musical phrases.', 'Nightingales are almost overexposed in poetry, but trying to describe its song, writes Lee, is like recounting a dream to a barista the next morning: it doesn’t quite work. Lee tells how Keats’s evocation of a nightingale singing outside his window on Hampstead Heath is widely disparaged, not least by DH Lawrence and John Clare. The latter, thinks Lee, gets closest to conveying the nightingale’s magic – but the musician himself delivers a fine appreciation of its song.', '“What reveals the nightingale to be such a master musician is his decoration of silence, because silence is such an important part of music,” says Lee. “And the best artists are the ones that really know how to work in that space.” Nightingales improvise but also use leitmotifs. They sing with each other too, and with people, as cellist Beatrice Harrison famously demonstrated when she began duetting with nightingales in a series of live BBC broadcasts in the 1920s.', 'Lee often hears nightingales passing a shared song along a hedgerow. Very occasionally, he and his concerts have discovered multiple birds singing a complicated song in unison. “It’s as though they all knew how to sing the same song. People can’t believe it just happened. It’s magic and proof of incredible other senses, and forms of communication, that we are completely tuned out of.”', 'Like every musician, Lee’s collaborations with the migratory nightingale, which flies from sub-Saharan Africa in rapidly-diminishing numbers each April to sing and raise young, endured a year of Covid-related cancellations. His tour to promote last year’s critically acclaimed album Old Wow was scrapped; his book postponed until now. “I lost loads of work, loads of gigs and all my income,” says Lee, with a grimace and a smile, “and I’ve had a wonderful time.” He spent more time in nature with his toddler daughter and swam in rivers he’d always meant to. He also discovered a new way of working online.', 'Last spring, he rapidly turned some nightingale concerts into online broadcasts. Lee built a digital studio in a wood and found a nightingale to sing with, while human collaborators played along from their homes via a live feed. The two feeds were married and broadcast online. “It allowed me to bring in guests who would have never participated in it,” says Lee. Last year’s Earth Day concert featured Pet Shop Boys, Bernard Butler, Lily Cole and Robert Macfarlane. “Some incredible people embraced it because they could. And so it opened many doors in that sense.”', 'The door to this way of working was first opened for Lee in childhood, when his parents spotted his love of nature and sent him on summer trips with Forest School Camps, where he learned the joys of bushcraft and singing around a campfire. He spent time with “wilderness teachers” including Ray Mears; later, when he discovered folk music, his mentor was Peter Kennedy, “the Cecil Sharp of the tape recorder” who went song collecting with David Attenborough in the 1950s.', 'Lee remembers being told by folk authorities that all the old oral singers were dead. “It’s a bit like being told, ‘No, that species is extinct. There’s no more of that particular gecko’. But you’re like, ‘I’ve heard talk from some elders that they’ve seen them out there…’” So Lee travelled to Ireland and Scotland over many summers, finding hundreds of unrecorded singers in Gypsy and Traveller communities. “I loved spending time at the knee of these elders. I could have gone to university and got a music degree and have learned from the textbook or just go to the well and drink from the most incredible source. I was very lucky. I caught an end of an era.”', 'There are strong parallels between Lee’s quest to record oral folk singers and his nightingale concerts. “When I visit a nightingale or go on an expedition to record an elder of a community singing some ancient song that has been passed down through the oral tradition, this is the same thing. It just happens to be a different language of song.”', 'It’s also a melancholy parallel. These are the end days for both traditions. “I’m hearing a folksong that’s been passed down for maybe 1,000 years and never written down and the last person to ever sing it is in their 80s. And the next time I go back to that caravan site, they’ll probably have passed on. And I often enter nightingale woods and sing with them and know that the chances of a nightingale being here next year is pretty unlikely.” Some concerts have been cancelled in certain places because the bird has become extinct there. “That’s an end of the line for that community who’ve probably been living there since the ice sheets retreated. That’s a great tragedy. There’s a lot of grief in that.”', 'Lee deals with this loss not by “worshipping the ashes” but by “tending the flame” in the words of Gustav Mahler. He’s made his collected folksongs freely available on songcollectors.org; this song trove is waiting to be reinterpreted and revived, and Lee’s next mission is to begin doing so.', 'Tending the flame for Lee has also involved creating Extinction Rebellion demonstrations. “Their journey as a brand new biggest ever community-led organisation in the world is phenomenal,” says Lee but he concedes that, post-Covid, “it’s uncertain what their journey ahead will be”. He’s now working with Music Declares Emergency to seek a carbon-neutral industry. “We’re living in a time of great transformation. Whether it’s fast enough, I don’t know. But we’re seeing real change at board level in multimillion dollar organisations, and that’s wonderful.”', 'Lee’s most immediate act of flame-tending involves committing himself to two months of exhaustion that is sleeping in a tent and singing with the nightingales. “I’m going to bed at two o’clock every night and at 4am the dawn chorus starts and I’m in a tent with no sound insulation. I am beyond tired. By the end of May, I am porous with exhaustion. But I become very emotionally connected. And I go into some funny states of mind.”', 'This year, England’s emergence from lockdown falls awkwardly in the middle of the April and May nightingale singing season. Camping is allowed before 17 May but campers singing – a concert – is not. So Lee is scrambling to ensure some duets are online only while arranging as many nightingale concerts with an in-person audience into the season’s end. “I lost last year and this year I will be even more grateful for every drop of nightingale song that I can squeeze out of the bird.”', 'His live partnerships are becoming ever more intriguing: Isobel Waller-Bridge (sister of Phoebe), Rihab Azar (London-based Syrian oud player) and Bernard Butler, who produced Old Wow. “The birds react to personalities and not professionality or Instagram follower numbers,” he says. “The great thing in curation is sussing out who are the live spirits as musicians who will get it.', 'And how does he celebrate the nightingale season’s end? “I do love sleeping in a bed. Closing the curtains and having darkness till 9am is such a luxury.” Lee laughs. “It’s so great what we’ve done with houses and windows and double glazing.”', 'The Nightingale by Sam Lee is published by Penguin on 25 March; the audiobook, read by Lee, includes musical elements. Sam Lee will be in conversation with Patrick Barkham at the RGS online on 31 March.']",['Patrick Barkham'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52a0b3e233f140734a17a5c607684ecfec471eb0/0_15_4093_2455/master/4093.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'Sam Lee with a nightingale.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7b5b69c1fbe6bcef8a645c1767e857d3e028613/0_0_1632_2539/master/1632.jpg?width=120&dpr=1&s=none', 'THE NIGHTINGALE by SAM LEE - book cover'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d456c0b0d17cff09073a17570cc946e939b6ffc/0_0_3829_2872/master/3829.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Sam Lee singing with nightingales in 2016.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36eb87713af88163285a38f5560d68784b528f0e/504_339_932_1165/master/932.jpg?width=120&dpr=1&s=none', 'Personality … different musicians evoke different responses in the nightingales.']]",

They are discovered hanging from a mango tree. Sexual activity may or may not have taken place, prior to their deaths. Were they killed or did they kill themselves? There are eyewitnesses who may be the aggressors – their stories don’t match up. To add to this, there is a defining visual image. The dead bodies hang from the tree for days, knocking against each other in repetitive, heart-breaking camaraderie, while the grieving women of the village form a circle around the tree trunk, to prevent the girls from being taken down. If they come down, Padma and Lalli (not their real names) will be forgotten. As long as the corpses retain the power to horrify, they are protected from indifference.', '“Place is the crossroads of circumstance,” Eudora Welty wrote in her 1957 essay “Place in Fiction” – “the proving ground of, what happened? Who’s here? Who’s coming?” In the The Good Girls, the shifting answers to these questions form a morass of half-truths and lies, freighting the ancient fields of Katra Sadatganj – an “eyeblink of a village” in Uttar Pradesh, north India – with existential threat. This ancestral land, a marker of power and identity for those who work in it, “put dal in the katori, clothes on the back … It made them cultivators. Without it they were landless labourers”. Those who inhabit it “believed they would sense if something was amiss, just as one can sense a change in the texture of one’s palm. But this was not the case.” What follows, in this shocking, mesmerising book by Sonia Faleiro, is an unravelling of shared hubris.', 'Faleiro uses the structures of a true crime narrative. The need in the reader to understand these painfully premature deaths and make sense of the world, means that the real objective of The Good Girls – to turn and face the factual horror of inequality – is skilfully masked. “Journalists justify their treachery in various ways according to their temperaments,” was the verdict of Janet Malcolm in The Journalist and the Murderer (1989); “The more pompous talk about freedom of speech and ‘the public’s right to know’; the least talented talk about Art.” In this sense, Faleiro is a judicious writer: as with her nonfiction debut Beautiful Thing – a portrait of the table dancers of Bombay – the prose in The Good Girls is full of precise intention. Facts are presented without the electric burn of outrage.', 'The reader plays detective as the story unfolds, piecing together “evidence” that is remembered from earlier chapters – a phone call, a text, a snatch of overheard conversation, an admission that might later be denied. The author will not hold your hand as you navigate this mystery; instead you are encouraged to solve it yourself.', 'At the heart of the book, and crucial to interpretation of events, is the question of consent – more specifically, of consensual desire. Padma and Lalli are referred to repeatedly by relatives and politicians as family assets – tangible, walking, breathing manifestations of family honour. There are multiple discussions as to whether they have been raped – at one point the media reports declare this to be incontrovertible, and yet the evidence does not support it beyond reasonable doubt. Vital evidence is tampered with, in the name of saving family honour: phone recordings are deleted, witnesses are told to revise their stories, and the number of potential rapists swells from one to five and back again. The idea that the girls might have had their own romantic lives with boys from the village is crushed in the white noise of gossip and misinformation.', 'Faleiro’s subjects are numerous and interconnected – from India’s corrupt politicians and media to the deleterious effects of caste prejudice and the systemic rot scouring its way through the police force. But her core subject is that of entrapment, and she returns again and again to the lack of agency that the girls have over their own lives, banned as they are from wandering freely around the village and its environs. The author concludes that “an Indian woman’s first challenge was surviving her own home”.', 'The girls’ nightly journey to squat in the fields after dinner to relieve themselves emerges as the only gap in a system set up to put them under constant surveillance. And it is this gap of possibility, at Welty’s “crossroads of circumstance” that Padma and Lalli enter flushed with life, only to die hours later. The Good Girls is a beautifully calibrated book, full of suspense to the final pages, urging us to walk into that night and listen.', 'You People by Nikita Lalwani is published by Viking.

Now there are plans for a Zaha Hadid Architects all-timber stadium…', 'A player miskicks the ball – skies it – and its clatter on the metal roof is the loudest sound in the Covid-emptied stand. There’s not much by way of a corresponding stand on the other side of the pitch, mostly just advertising boards and a momentarily malfunctioning scoreboard. Behind them a hillock, behind that a sunset. There’s an ill-timed tackle, a melee of angry players, a red card for the home team. But the visitors, Colchester United, look rudderless – it’s the first game for their interim manager – and 10-man Forest Green Rovers run out 3-0 winners.', 'If much of this is a typical scene of lower-league football, as played out all over the country every week of the season, in some crucial details it is not. It’s partly the setting that’s different, on a hill outside Stroud in Gloucestershire, in a landscape more redolent of point-to-points than professional football. “Jilly Cooper loves Forest Green Rovers!” says one of the billboards – a tribute from a local author to the local team. “Red sky at night,” says one of the few people permitted to be there, as he contemplates the sunset, “shepherds’ delight.” I’m pretty sure I haven’t heard that line of commentary at a football match before.', 'And then there’s the fact that the players’ striking strips (lime green with a black zebra-stripe pattern) are – tonight, for the first time for any team anywhere in the world – made with a composite of waste coffee grounds and recycled plastic.

One has the skull and crossbones insignia of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society: Defending Ocean Wildlife Worldwide, it says. My stomach is getting to know a shiitake mushroom burger I ate just before kick-off, and finding it less confrontational, digestion-wise, than the traditional meat-and-whatever-else version that is served at football grounds.', 'For this is Forest Green Rovers, declared by Fifa the “greenest team in the world”, certified by the United Nations as the world’s first carbon-neutral football club, which in the decade since its acquisition by the green energy industrialist Dale Vince has become famous well beyond its size, for its sustainability and, especially, for the all-vegan menus offered to both players and fans. It’s not stopping there: apart from the coffee kits, there’s also a plan for a new all-timber stadium designed by Zaha Hadid Architects, which in February was approved by the English Football League, having won planning permission from Stroud District Council last December.', 'Nor are Vince’s wider range of eco-initiatives slowing down. He shows me some diamonds on the Zoom screen, made with carbon (incredible as this may seem) taken from the atmosphere, a process that he says reduces the colossal waste that comes with mining the precious stones. He already has Devil’s Kitchen, a vegan food business spun off from the football club, which makes burgers, plant balls and suchlike, now available through Ocado. The main source of his wealth is Ecotricity, a renewable energy supplier that developed from the windmills Vince erected in the 1990s. He created Nemesis, a Lotus Exige chassis modified with electric motors and batteries, which in 2012 broke the UK speed record for electric cars. Last month, he teamed up with the Daily Express, of all newspapers, to promote its Green Britain Needs You campaign.', 'Vince’s speciality is to bring green practices and ideas to blokey aspects of life not usually associated with such things: football, burgers, cars. Or, three decades ago, energy provision. “You have the most fun and most impact preaching to the unconverted,” he says of his work with the Express. “On the right wing of life the people at the Express have had people saying to them: ‘What are you doing working with that bloke?’ and on the left wing of life I’ve had people saying to me: ‘What are you doing working with that newspaper?’ And we both say the same thing – we can’t live in our bubbles, we’ve got to talk to each other.”', 'Vince, 59, is the sort of have-a-go entrepreneur who you might have thought was extinct in a time of corporate leviathans. He is restless, rapid-speaking, both engaging and elusive, his manner at once laidback and wired. I’m told by people who’ve dealt with him that he is both shy and direct, that “he doesn’t hang back from expressing opinions”, that he can be assertive, that he “doesn’t suit the more English-y sort of people”. As he describes himself in his recent book, Manifesto: “I look at and do things my own way. It’s got me into plenty of trouble but it’s also a bit of a superpower.”', 'He might now be described as “Britain’s richest hippy”, living in a castellated former fort on a hill above Stroud, with a large solar array in its untamed garden, but he once had almost nothing. The son of a Great Yarmouth lorry driver, he left school at 15 and spent years as a traveller, living in a lashed-up old ambulance, or a pickup truck, or a bus, driving a 30-year-old fire engine to Spain, riding motorbikes, moving from one site to another – “old airfields, gravel pits, car parks”, as Vince writes in Manifesto. In 1985 he was embroiled in the notorious “Battle of the Beanfield”, an outbreak of what he calls “wanton state-sponsored violence”, an assault by 1,300 police on 600 travellers heading towards Stonehenge.', 'In 1991 he had “an epiphany”. He’d already made a little money putting up improvised wind-powered phone stations (“windphones”) at the Glastonbury festival, and he’d added a small windmill to his trailer, connected to old train batteries he’d rescued from a scrapyard, capable of 50 watts, enough for two dim lights and water pump. The first big power-generating windmills in Britain were built that year, in Cornwall, and Vince decided to have a go himself. He educated himself on “aerodynamics, mechanics, electronics, statistics… windmill technology, planning and environment assessments, grid compatibility, financial modelling, construction”.', 'He made his own 30-metre mast for testing wind speed, won the co-operation of the owner of the hill, and spent his last “few hundred quid” on some respectable clothes and a flight to Germany to meet the manufacturers of the then-unconventional variable-speed windmill that he wanted. He gained planning permission. Representing himself in court, he defeated a legal challenge from the National Trust. He negotiated a connection to the local grid, raised £350,000 in finance and, five years after his epiphany, got the windmill up and running.', 'This was the beginning of Ecotricity, a company that in 2019 had a turnover of £201m. Later, Vince turned to electric transport: the Nemesis project never turned into a mass-produced car, but it did lead to the Electric Highway, a national network of charging points. Vince’s company had to fight off an attempt by Elon Musk and Tesla to shove them aside, but it now has 300 stations across the country.', 'Forest Green Rovers now looks like a perfect extension to the Ecotricity brand – it even has “green” in its name – but Vince insists that its transformation into a “global force” was “serendipity”. “I just bumped into it along the way. It was a rescue mission, only that.” The club was “leaking money everywhere… it was about to fold. I thought that was wrong. It was a big part of this community, 120 years old, lovely people. They invited me to a game. It was fabulous, like a small theatre, intense and personal.”', 'He stepped in and bought it. “On day two I bumped into the fact that we were serving red meat to our players and I thought: ‘Oh my God, we’re part of the meat trade, I can’t be that,’ so we had to make that change.” They realised, he says, “that we might not be speaking to the most receptive audience, but that only added to the appeal of doing it. The one thing everyone wants to know is how can you have a vegan menu without having a riot from your fans.” The answer, he says, was to show that “food without animals in is great food”. The club’s players “were the easiest audience of all. We simply said to them that red meat will impair your performance.” It’s now widely recognised among elite athletes, says Vince, that vegan diets improve performance and reduce injury. The Manchester City striker Sergio Agüero, for example, goes on a vegan diet during the football season.', 'So they sell the fans pies, sausage rolls and burgers, chips and gravy, all plant-based, as well as options that are not imitating meat. Away supporters, the club chef Jade Crawford tells me, mockingly turn up in butchers’ aprons. They chant “Where’s your burger van?” But, she says, the products she offers “sell out, so they must like them”. Some home fans “said at first they were a bit annoyed about it. They said they might stop coming, but they tried the food and said it was really good.”', 'The diet has grabbed most of the headlines, but there are other aspects to Forest Green’s greenness: power from solar panels and from Ecotricity’s green energy, a pitch free of chemical fertilisers or pesticides, charging points for electric cars, the capturing of rainwater from the roof to irrigate the pitch, an electric van for the kit man, and soon, it is hoped, an electric team bus. There’s a well-publicised “mow-bot”, a GPS-directed solar-powered lawnmower.', 'Forest Green Rovers’ performances on the pitch have improved since Vince’s takeover. Once teetering on the edge of relegation from the Conference, the fifth tier of English football, they were later promoted to League Two, which in the logic-free system of numbering these things is the fourth tier. They currently have good prospects of promotion to League One and hopes of eventually getting to the level above that, the Championship.', 'The combination of veganism, sustainability and some sporting success has brought them global attention. They have 100 fan clubs in over 20 countries, such as the Forest Green Rovers Chicagoland Supporters group, foundedin 2016 by people who “shared a passion for the environment and soccer”. The Arsenal full-back Héctor Bellerín, attracted by the club’s ethos, has become a shareholder. “Engaging fans through their favourite sport and getting them to be fans of the environment” is what Vince calls it. The United Nations invited the club to be founding members of its Sports for Climate Action programme, which, he says, “is pretty much based on what Forest Green have done”. Bigger names have followed where Forest Green Rovers have led. The mighty Real Madrid recently announced a partnership with the British plant-based producer Meatless Farm to encourage sustainable eating (still a lesser level of commitment to the environment than that of the Stroud side).', 'The future stadium, which will use contemporary timber engineering techniques to achieve its all-wooden structure, is intended as a vehicle to get the club to the next level, while also promoting its principles. It will have a capacity of 5,000, with the ability to go up to 10,000 or 12,000 without too much difficulty, which would be big enough for a Championship side. “We might shoot for 15,” says the ever-ambitious Vince. Because timber is renewable, and absorbs carbon during its growth, it greatly reduces the carbon and energy costs that go into construction, which might be three times those expended on such things as light, heat and power used over the lifetime of a stadium.', 'The stadium’s completion is still some years off, not least because it is to be part of a grander plan: a “Green Technology Cluster”, a “truly sustainable” business park that aims to create up to 4,000 jobs. Some 20% of the 50 hectare site is to be wetlands, alongside a restored stretch of a historic canal. The location is currently green fields, next to Junction 13 of the M5. This doesn’t sound environmental – neither building on fields nor relying on road transport – but “farmed fields are wildlife deserts”, Vince says, and his proposals will provide more biodiversity than the land they replace. There are not many options for getting fans to his stadium by public transport, but he promises electric buses and cross-country walking and cycling routes.', 'The seductive images of the project show an elegant curving form rising out of a lush green landscape, its undulations echoing the soft hills behind. In some ways it is what you would expect from Zaha Hadid Architects – striking forms are their thing, and their work on the London 2012 Aquatics Centre and Al Wakrah Stadium for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, as well as their now-abandoned designs for the Tokyo Olympic Stadium, have made sports buildings one of their specialities. On the other hand, the Forest Green Rovers project is small by the current standards of this global practice, and their designs – which are almost always in concrete and steel – have not hitherto been especially noted for their sustainability. The mighty roof of the Aquatics Centre, for example, used prodigious quantities of steel.', 'Alex de Rijke, an architect who has pioneered modern timber construction, including a proposed wooden handball arena for the London Olympics, is sceptical that ZHA are the best people for the job, given their previous lack of interest in timber structures. It’s “excellent that Forest Green are building a timber stadium”, he says, but wonders whether this design grows out of the structural characteristics of wood or steel. He suggests that the practice isn’t usually driven by optimised use of sustainable materials, but by what he calls “the dogged mission to invent novel forms” – the desire, to put it another way, to look striking.', 'Jim Heverin, the director at ZHA in charge of the project, acknowledges that this is partly new territory for them, which was part of the attraction of the job: they want “to grow out of the shadow of what people think we are, and carbon is the challenge of our generation”. He says that the design does pay attention to issues such as waste – the curving silhouettes are made out of assemblies of straight elements, for example – and as it develops they will also consider such matters as the distance the materials have to travel from their place of origin.', 'He’s also clear that looking striking – the power of the image – is important to the practice, and that the project “will cost more than normal because it’s not conventional – you can’t just buy it out of factories”. This reflects an aspect of the Vince philosophy, which is that “whether it’s burgers, cars or football we can still have fun doing it differently”. The idea of Nemesis, he once said, was to “smash the boring, Noddy stereotype of the green car”. His current plan for mining the sky for diamonds is “bling without the sting”.', 'Which brings up a core question behind the whole Vince enterprise: what’s the substance, what’s the spectacle, what is what he calls “storytelling”? It’s hard to think, for example, that a solar-powered lawnmower will make a huge impact on the club’s carbon footprint; its role is more to be an eye-catching messenger of its values. But it’s hard to argue with the seriousness of his overall achievement. The point of his combined ventures is that they are all of the above: they combine the humdrum business of large-scale energy provision with the coffee kits and the shiitake burgers that get environmental messages to hard-to-reach audiences.', 'His hometown of Stroud, birthplace of Extinction Rebellion, is the sort of place that would give short shrift to greenwash. Although his building proposals have attracted objections, there doesn’t seem to be much by way of significant challenges to his overall green credentials. The worst thing I hear about him is that his presence is a bit too dominating, looking down on the town from his castle, his burger-windmill-diamond factory and frequent Ecotricity banners being hard to miss. “It’s a bit medieval,” I’m told.', 'Molly Scott Cato, a Stroud resident who until Brexit was a Green party MEP for South West England, has had some political confrontations with the Labour-supporting Vince, who wanted the Greens to step aside at the last general election. But she said that “it’s brilliant for the town having a renewable energy firm” and that the “football club is really important in reaching out to people that are hardest to get to”. He may not, with his flurries of initiatives, always get everything right, but collectively they’re a force for good. If Forest Green Rovers raise the question: how much impact can a League Two football club have, the answer is quite a lot.']",['Rowan Moore'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30e2927f046ab6c2a99a158dfac1d88bb66237a1/809_507_4586_2752/master/4586.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'Forest Green Rovers cards'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16423e6a3ed19b14d8b7910f77d3e90e75318a5f/0_0_2364_1330/master/2364.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Zaha Hadid Architects’ design for a new all-timber stadium.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93572e90bad67c3115e4182a299ba15836dac4e9/0_0_6717_4480/master/6717.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Dale Vince at the Forest Green Rovers ground in Nailsworth, Gloucestershire.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/880d3204421c99e99f689166dbaf5674a6406e93/0_0_2048_1365/master/2048.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Local author Jilly Cooper is a supporter of the club.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a9df924fe018ea5368a4e54de25d02cf3c5143c/0_0_4159_2869/master/4159.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Arsenal’s Héctor Bellerín, attracted by the club’s ethos, has become a shareholder.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e9a5c2f0bc2875ffc15ddb006f11a0b32b82c3a/0_0_3210_1986/master/3210.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Forest Green Rovers v Colchester United - Sky Bet League Two']]",

We eat microplastics, breathe pollution and watch other life-forms decline to extinction. We face intersecting poverty, health, climate and biodiversity crises. Our global predicament is that consumption by the wealthy is driving us towards planetary disaster, yet billions live in poverty and need to consume more to live well. In this cycle, any version of “success” only hastens catastrophe.', 'Solving this conundrum requires much more than merely reducing the impact of high-consumption lifestyles. Similarly, if we focus on increasing efficiency this tends to increase resource use: make cars cheaper to run and people drive more. The core of any response that truly rises to this challenge will be interlocking policies that drive society on to an equitable and sustainable path.', 'Here are four policies that work together to maximise people’s welfare and freedoms, drive essential technological innovation, and allow society to operate within Earth’s limits. At their heart is human dignity coupled with breaking the dynamic of ever-greater production and consumption. Together they could quickly reorient the doomsday machine that is today’s global economy.', 'The first policy is universal basic income (UBI) whereby a financial payment is made to every citizen, unconditionally, at a level above their subsistence needs. UBI is needed to break the link between work and consumption. Critically, there is a constant awareness that we all need to be ever more productive at work, otherwise someone else will take our job. In response we have all said: I work hard, so I deserve that fancy meal, new gadget or long-haul holiday. Increased consumption is the reward for being ever more productive at work. Indeed, it makes little sense to curb our consumption when we know we will have to be ever more productive at work, regardless of our choices.', 'Fears that UBI may lead to laziness are unfounded: small-scale trials of UBI show people work hard and are typically more entrepreneurial. Crucially, those UBI recipients had lower anxiety, stress and health problems. UBI allows people to say no to undesirable work, unless it is well-paid enough. People can also say yes to opportunities that often lie out of reach, as they can study or retrain. And clearly there is an immense amount of work to do, from caring for others, to producing what we all need to live well. With UBI we would increasingly choose work that we thought mattered, rather than working ever harder to consume ever more.', 'The second policy framework is what I call universal shared services – others have argued for universal basic services, but what’s needed must be far beyond basic. Many countries have some of these, from healthcare to education. These are the services everyone needs and their delivery has society-wide effects. Core are health, education, energy, housing and leisure services. Providing these universally lowers financial costs due to economies of scale, and can substantially lower environmental costs. Such universal services make societies more equal and drive them towards more sustainability if two further policies are enacted.', 'The third policy tackles the climate emergency via legally binding ever-declining carbon budgets. This framework exists in the UK, following the 2008 Climate Change Act. The government must reduce UK carbon emissions to within a carbon budget. These five-year budgets decline to a zero allocation by 2050. This act also created an independent statutory body that analyses data and advises the government on how to achieve each successive carbon budget. The advice results in new legislation for specific sectors and drives technological innovation as the zero emissions long-term destination is clear. As a result the UK is world-leading in reducing carbon emissions.', 'The fourth policy uses the same declining budget principle, but tackles material use rather than energy generation. Similarly, declining “plastic use budgets” can set society on a pathway to eliminating plastic pollution. The same principle can tackle metal use to limit the damage from mining. A budget for the total amount of land used to produce the food a country consumes can limit the footprint of agriculture, central to halting biodiversity loss. As with carbon emissions, scientists can now track the production and use of plastic, metal and food. Scientific monitoring and new “declining budget” policies could keep material use within Earth’s limits.', 'These four policy goals together would drive people’s welfare up and our environmental impacts down. They are not new, nor are they very radical. We already, for example, assure incomes for pensioners in many countries, healthcare is universal in a number of countries, and declining carbon budgets are being used to help drive today’s energy transition.', 'But how to pay for it? The first response of the powerful to change is to argue that the costs are too great. They rarely are. After two decades of arguments about the high costs of tackling climate change, consultants to big business McKinsey now report that the cost of Europe reaching net zero emissions by 2050 is itself net zero. The investments literally pay for themselves. Revenue-raising options should also help to implement the four policies more cheaply; these could include taxes on rentiers financial transactions, and high energy or material use. Of course, without pressure from popular protest movements and political parties, nothing will change.', 'Yet systemic thinking on how to respond to global problems is increasing. The Covid-19 pandemic has produced a new seriousness by graphically revealing that there actually is no “outside” of society or the environment. When there’s no such thing as “outside”, the neoliberal mantra of avoiding taxes and regulations to keep wealth to yourself makes less and less sense. With political pressure and smart policies a new universality that breaks with centuries of exploiting people and the environment could be within reach.

The damage public institutions inflict on themselves by receiving this sponsorship exceeds any benefits. Just as their hands were once stained with nicotine, now they are stained with oil. The tobacco experience suggests that it can take many years to expunge these damn’d spots and restore their reputations.', 'This is the position in which the Science Museum now finds itself. It appears to have learned nothing from the reputational harm it caused itself by accepting money from the oil companies BP and Equinor. Last week it revealed that Shell was funding – wait for it – its new exhibition on climate breakdown.', 'Although many other great institutions – such as the National Galleries in London and Scotland, the Tate Galleries, the National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Southbank Centre, the American Museum of Natural History and the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam – have cut their ties with fossil fuel industries, the Science Museum seems determined to tar and feather itself. Its director, Sir Ian Blatchford, told journalists: “Even if the Science Museum were lavishly publicly funded I would still want to have sponsorship from the oil companies.” Something tells me this will not age well.', 'The exhibition, called Our Future Planet, emphasises the technologies that might capture the carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, or extract it from the air once it has been released. The Science Museum tells me that Shell had no influence over its design or content. I believe it, but to my eye the exhibition aligns neatly with oil company agendas. For years, oil firms have sought to delay the retirement of their reserves for as long as possible by emphasising technofixes. If carbon dioxide can be captured, this could buy time in which their discovery and drilling, landgrabs and leaks, pollution and profits can continue for longer than society might otherwise permit.', 'As Culture Unstained (which seeks to bring oil sponsorship to an end) points out, most of the technologies the exhibition promotes are either speculative, extremely expensive or, despite ample opportunity, simply not happening. For example, carbon capture and storage (CCS) – extracting carbon from the exhaust gases of power stations, then piping it into geological formations – has been noisily promoted as a leading solution for 20 years. But so far only 26 plants of any kind are using it, and 22 of these are rigs using the CO2 they pump underground to drive more oil out of the rocks (a process called enhanced oil recovery).', 'The commitments to CCS in Shell’s latest annual report are vague and generic. Yet many of its promises to cut net emissions rely on a combination of this technology and offsets. While capture technologies are generally failing to materialise, the scale of the necessary carbon cuts means that offsetting emissions is no longer viable. We need both to maximise the retirement of fossil fuels and maximise the drawing down of carbon, preferably through the rewilding of ecosystems. One is not a substitute for the other.', 'Yes, we should explore any technologies that might help to prevent climate breakdown. But we should not allow them to be used as greenwash. Unless fossil fuel companies retire their reserves at a rate commensurate with preventing more than 1.5C of heating, they remain a lethal threat to human wellbeing and the survival of other lifeforms. So far, none of them, even on paper, have plans compatible with preventing more than 2C of heating, let alone 1.5C. Shell’s programme was criticised by environmental groups last week as being hazy and halfhearted.', 'The company argues, correctly, that its targets are conditional on being “in step with society”. Otherwise it “will be trying to sell products that our customers do not want”. But by producing ads that exaggerate its commitment to reducing emissions, it seeks to assuage public opinion and, I believe, delay the demand for a transition from fossil fuels. In my view, the exhibition at the Science Museum has the same effect.', 'Worse still, while Shell has cut its ties with some lobby groups, it is still a member of several, such as the Consumer Energy Alliance and the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association, which have sought to stymie climate policies. It hopes that much of its future profit will come from the rising production of plastics. Last year, the American Chemistry Council, to which Shell also belongs, lobbied for trade rules that would rip down Kenya’s strict measures on single-use plastic, and force the country to keep accepting plastic waste from other nations. It wanted to turn Kenya into “a hub for supplying US-made chemicals and plastics to other markets in Africa”.', 'When I challenged the museum, it pointed me to an article by Blatchford, in which he argued, “we believe the right approach is to engage, debate and challenge companies … to do more to make the global economy less carbon intensive.” So do I. But how does accepting their funding help? It doesn’t exactly enhance your power, does it? “Do what we say or we won’t take your money any more.”', 'This, I believe, is a zero-sum game. The credibility that Shell might gain from its association with the Science Museum is credibility the Science Museum loses. What Shell seeks, as its CEO admits, is “a strong societal licence to operate”. By sponsoring august cultural institutions, oil companies hope to normalise an ecocidal business model. In doing so, they contaminate anyone foolish enough to take their money.', 'George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist']",['George Monbiot'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f258dd2a3388ed3ad74ee86e452b9245b409bc17/0_41_4457_2676/master/4457.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', '']]",

Though he keeps musician’s hours, getting up at 11am and going to bed at 5am, creating physical items appeals to him. “My life’s work with music is intangible,” he says. “It’s creativity that you cannot touch. And so making things that you can touch: a vase that you can hold, a book you can put it on the shelf, say… for me, that’s fascinating.”', 'He has always taken photographs (some were used in REM’s imagery) and he collects some, too. So his first and second books involved several archive pictures, but he planned for the third volume to be different: he would take a series of portraits of people he felt exhibited “immense strength, combined with a very open vulnerability”. His wishlist of subjects was entirely comprised of women and included Patti Smith and Greta Thunberg.', 'He started work on the book in 2019. First up was writer Joan Didion, but she declined his approach. Stipe didn’t mind, but Didion’s polite refusal led him to wonder if he could include her in a different way.

So he expanded the book’s concept to include people other than women – “to de-gender the project”, as he puts it. All the people he wanted to feature “are, for me, insanely heroic. The work that they’ve done, their activism, their art.”', 'Stipe’s list of strong-but-vulnerable subjects grew. Meanwhile, his life (like everyone’s) was about to shrink. Back in the US, in March 2020, Stipe was out of New York when Dozol tested positive for Covid-19 (he recovered well). He decided not to return immediately, and instead went to Athens, Georgia, where his mother, sister and uncle live: “The decision was about family,” he says. “My mother had some difficult health issues.” He ended up staying for a while.', 'Abruptly, Stipe had to become domestic: organising and caring, doing practical and maintenance jobs that he hadn’t done for years. “Climbing ladders, replacing lightbulbs, cleaning out gutters, mowing the lawn, doing the dishes, cleaning and mopping.” How was that? “It takes up a lot of time,” he says. “And also, like everyone else, I found I couldn’t concentrate. I couldn’t focus on anything.”', 'He started listening to podcasts, which he had never done before, finding his way there via some taped conversations he had of Lou Reed talking to the music producer Hal Willner. Stipe’s listening choices are very him: shows about art and queer issues. He loves 99% Invisible (about design), Your Undivided Attention (on the way social media manipulates us), Against Everyone (a countercultural show from former sex worker Conner Habib), Still Processing (a New York Times culture podcast), LaunchLeft (established artists recommend new ones, hosted by Rain Phoenix), Not Really (a gossipy gay New York podcast), Homo Sapiens (Alan Cumming and Christopher Sweeney’s queer interview show), Talk Art (Russell Tovey and Robert Diament chat art collecting), and New Models. “New Models is this fascinating, very high level of academic conversation, about technology and activism, and politics, and art. They’re talking in a language that is so above my pay grade. I feel the same as when I listen to Wagner. I don’t know exactly what I’m hearing, but I feel better and smarter for having listened to it.”', 'Listening to podcasts and doing his chores, he considered what to do with his new book. Under lockdown, he couldn’t take anyone’s photograph (he didn’t want to do Zoom portraits) and couldn’t collaborate with the artist/curator he had originally wanted to be involved. So he decided to work in a different way.', 'Stipe had already commissioned some vases from a ceramicist called Caroline Wallner, with a view to using them in an art exhibition. He asked her to put names on them, and they became a way of making a portrait of some of the people he wanted in the book: Mick Jagger, Lou Reed and Cate Blanchett. He also got in touch with a New York printmaker he knew, and asked her to make some book covers with people’s names on them (including Didion’s). He rekindled an old interest in fonts, and designed some of his own. The book Michael Stipe is now a combination of new portraits, photos of vases and book covers with names on them and lists of names printed in fonts designed by Stipe.', 'It’s a lot freer than the original idea, and, in his head, has become a chronicle of lockdown. “The things that were impacting me wound up making their way in,” he says. “The book just expanded and expanded.” There’s even a podcast-y element: if you scan the QR codes on various pages, they lead to audio recordings of Stipe musing on why he included certain pictures, his thinking behind their placement.', 'The book becomes more about family as it goes on: pictures of close friends such as Sam and Aaron Taylor-Johnson give way to snaps of his sister and his mum – who is fine, despite the pandemic worries. “My mum’s going gangbusters again, and she’s great.” On one page, there’s a lovely vintage picture of a couple: these are Stipe’s grandparents. “My grandmother and her brother would jump on the train from Mississippi and go to New Orleans on the weekend,” says Stipe. “She had flapper clothes and she danced. That’s her and my Papi, the two of them madly in love.” He had another grandfather who, he says, was a preacher: “And I know I can get very preacher-ilian and hectoring. I got it, too, I got it honest, as we say.”', 'I wouldn’t call Stipe hectoring: he just listens hard and answers carefully and fully. What he seems is sensitive, worried, unable to be glib. Stephen Colbert of the Late Show has described Stipe as “vibrating in reaction to the world”, and that seems right. As a singer, he seemed to mainline emotion; and though he has a light, almost flirty, social presence, he can’t laugh off horrible politics or cruelty, or climate change. Actually, the world affects him so much that, a few years ago, he was advised by a therapist to stop watching the news; he came off social media around three years ago, too, and stayed off. He used to post jokey pictures of himself on Instagram with famous friends, but with the other person cropped out, so the image was just of him grinning madly. He hates social media now.', '“It’s so upsetting to me that it took the end of the years of Trump as president for Twitter and Jack Dorsey to finally decide that Trump had said something that was offensive on Twitter, and [his account] needed to be suspended,” he says. “That platform allowed Trump a voice that put wind under his sails, and allowed for the type of disgusting behaviour that earmarks those years, and allowed a pandemic to run ravage across our country and across the world. It’s an embarrassing and horrifying chapter of our history. This stupid male idea of power, it’s so dumb.” He warms to his theme: “It’s saddo and dumdum. We’re on a second-grade level here: Saddo and Dumdum. We’re better than this. Americans, you know, we’re particularly good at showing our asses publicly. But when I say we, I mean all of us. We’re better than this.”', 'This is the preacher-ilian mode he was talking about earlier, and it hovers quite near the surface. Still, that’s not to say he can’t take a joke. When earlier this year the Guardian asked Stipe whom he would most like to apologise to, he said: “Anyone I slept with before the age of 27, because I was a selfish, cold-ass bitch.” Would he care to explain? “Well, it was me trying to be funny,” he says now, “but I was an incredibly insecure and selfish young man. I don’t think I was pleasant to be around, and I don’t think I was a very good lay. It took me the better part of my 20s to recognise that insecurities are actually a superpower, and something that I can utilise to allow my better work to come out of me. I don’t have to be snipy and cynical. Cold-ass bitch was a coat that I put on to protect myself and I realised, I can take that coat off now.”', 'It sounds as if he was just scared. “I’m a very fearful person. Truthfully, a lot of what this book is about is the people who represent fearlessness to me.”', 'When it comes to fearlessness, Stipe has always taken a lot of strength from his friendship with Patti Smith, whom he admired when he was young and is still delighted to be friends with. He shows me a mask of William Blake with writing scrawled over it; a gift from Smith. “She’s the one who said to me, ‘At some point, you need to walk unafraid’,” he says. “And I turned that phrase into a song about exactly that (REM’s Walk Unafraid). But that fierce fearlessness is something that I still look to. To show me the way, to pull me away from the parts of myself that allow me to be absorbed into fear. And to run towards the thing that scares you the most. As a creative person, that’s maybe a superpower.”', 'Because he admires artists so much, Stipe loves operating in a high-art friendship zone and enjoys telling tales about this, resulting in some heavy-duty name-dropping. For instance, he tells me that, every summer, he and Dozol go on holiday to France with the artist Sophie Calle. (There’s a picture of Calle in the book, with the hotelier and businessman Paddy McKillen.) “Oh my God, I was terrified to meet Sophie at first,” he says. “Her work is amazing, ripping apart the facade that people put up and seeing what’s behind it. But she’s got this wicked, fierce sense of humour.”', 'Anyway, one time, Calle was in New York and Stipe arranged to meet her at an art opening. He asked where she was staying, and she said, Canal Street, at Laurie Anderson’s. And at that time, Stipe lived on Canal Street and was friends with Anderson; he was delighted by the coincidence. After the show, Anderson said, “Do you mind if I call Lou?” (Lou Reed, her husband, who died in 2013).', '“So she called Lou, and he showed up, and then I was like, ‘I told Patti Smith I was going to see her.’ So Patti showed up, and my friend Tom Gilroy. We all sat there, in this little tapas bar in Soho. Lou Reed, Laurie Anderson, Sophie Calle, Patti Smith, myself, and my best friend, Tom.” Stipe is clearly extremely chuffed with getting all these people together: “Lou and Tom were sat next to each other and they started talking about film. And then it went deep, into indie film-makers no one’s ever heard of before. It was amazing to watch.”', 'Stipe is never happier than when he’s in a room full of clever, artistic types. His life, pre-lockdown, was unbelievably social. “Yes, lockdown is the only time I’ve never felt Fomo,’ he says. “I’m always, ‘Where’s the party, where are the exciting people?’” His extended stay in Athens was a completely other life and it has taken a while to adjust back to the city. “This is a very different space to being in my house alone.”', 'He tells me about some parties where he met famous people. He went to a Vanity Fair Oscars do in the mid-1990s, invited by an agent friend, where he met Gore Vidal. “He’s so tall. So handsome. He’s fucking Gore Vidal. And I’m like, looking up at him like this,” – he pulls a face of extreme awe – “My reaction was to get away. I turned, and who was standing two feet from me? Nancy Reagan. With her hair all fluffed up. I screamed! I shrieked like a cartoon woman on a table with a mouse.”', 'At the dinner, he was sitting next to the film director William Friedkin, who didn’t talk to him because Stipe wasn’t in the movie business. But Stipe enjoyed himself anyway. “I wound up drinking quite a lot. And I went around the room and I sat down with people. I was like, “Shirley MacLaine, I want to tell you about my dreams.” I made a real mess of myself. But I did get to congratulate Dolly.” (Dolly Parton was nominated for an Oscar for writing I Will Always Love You, Whitney Houston’s version of which was in The Bodyguard.)', 'Stipe has put a Parton vase in his book, opposite a Laurie Anderson one, because he thought they have a lot in common. “I put people together in the that I thought would really appreciate each other’s company.” And this is what his book is about, I think; staging a vast virtual party, full of people that Stipe would like to see, or hang out with, or see hang out with each other; to meet even if they are dead. Lockdown has meant he can create his ideal event, full of the beautiful, the clever, the artistic, the brave, the activist. His family and everyone who inspires him, and he thinks we should admire. The best party ever.', '“We need all of these minds, pushing us to be a better version of ourselves,” he says. “This is our learning period. We’ve just come through this terrible thing together that indicated how much we are all connected. I hope that what comes out of this is something that helps to elevate all of us, and to show ourselves to ourselves, show ourselves to each other.” He realises he sounds a little Pollyanna-ish, and his expression changes again, silliness and self-deprecation scudding across: “I know that I’m like, head-in-the-sky guy, and it sounds really naive, but, you know: it really is all about love.”', 'Michael Stipe is published on 29 April by damianieditore.com, priced at £50. The book includes QR-linked free audio content.', 'This article was amended on 24 and 26 April 2021. An earlier version said REM broke up in 2010, rather than 2011.

In a secularised Britain, it happily reverts to its previous role of feasting and fun. Easter, on the other hand, proclaims a story that is so shocking and unsettling it cannot easily be placarded in public. That is why the early church tried to shield this mystery from public view with its disciplina arcani.', 'What happened on Good Friday and Easter Day is so threatening to how we think of ourselves that the only way we can cope with it is to tame it into chocolate eggs and bunnies.

Boris Johnson’s government, cheered on by sections of the British press, is waging a “war on woke” to deal with this alleged crisis, targeting leftwing activists, anti-racists, academics and trans rights advocates.', 'Some have suggested ministers are stoking this culture war to distract voters from their failures in government. But this explanation underestimates the ideological reasons behind the government’s strategy, which is better understood as an attempt to shift the Overton window to the right while framing the rights of minorities as a fringe concern. The Conservatives seek a post-Brexit Britain bolstered by (among other things) an increasingly nativist and divisive populism, and a national pride in the achievements of the British empire, untrammelled by leftwing critics.', 'There is a long history in Britain of the right whipping up a moral panic about leftwing activists working within state institutions to promote minority issues that most “ordinary” people supposedly oppose. In the 1980s, the British media portrayed a coalition of Marxists, anti-racists, feminists and gay rights activists as the “loony left”, a trope that was embraced by editors, journalists and politicians alike, particularly during the 1987 general election.', 'Under Margaret Thatcher, the Conservatives endorsed a neoliberal free-market economy, but their liberalism did not extend beyond this. The government’s regressive approach to issues of race, gender and sexuality was famously characterised as one of “Victorian values”. For the British right in the 1980s, a war on the “loony left” was part of a broader ideological battle to reverse the social changes of the 1960s, when progress had been made on issues such as legalising homosexuality and abortion, and the increased awareness the “1968 generation” showed towards the rights of women, gay people and Black and Asian people.', 'After Thatcher’s electoral victory in 1979, the influence that the British left had previously enjoyed withered. Meanwhile, the face of leftwing politics was changing. In the 1970s and 80s, an array of social movements emerged, including the Anti-Nazi League in response to the National Front, the women’s liberation movement and the growing gay rights movement. These pluralist movements indicated that the left needed to take issues such as race, gender and sexuality seriously.', 'While many leftwing MPs resigned themselves to fighting defensive battles at the national level, local government became a fertile site of resistance to Thatcherism. Councils across London, alongside the Greater London council (GLC) under Ken Livingstone, Sheffield city council and Liverpool city council became places to enact socialist politics in a country governed by majority Tory rule. The GLC funded anti-racist, feminist and pro-LGBT initiatives, while many local councils made strident efforts to denounce apartheid in South Africa and announced nuclear-free zones. In London, Ken Livingstone infamously organised talks with Sinn Féin representatives through the GLC.', 'Unsurprisingly, this provoked anger among sections of the British press. As James Curran, Ivor Gaber and Julian Petley show in their book, Culture Wars: The Media and the British Left, the tabloids started using the term “loony left” in the mid-1980s to portray “the rise of a ‘crackpot’ left more concerned with minorities than with class”. Apocryphal stories of what would come to be known in the 1990s as “political correctness gone mad”, such as the alleged banning of the word “manhole” or the censoring of the nursery rhyme Baa Baa Black Sheep by Hackney council, made tabloid headlines – supposedly exposing the left’s fixation with “fringe” and minority issues.', 'Stories of the “loony left” helped to justify the ultimate abolition of the GLC. The Conservatives made this a promise in their 1983 election manifesto, and alongside the defeat of the miners’ strike in 1985, the dissolution of the GLC in 1986 can be viewed as a Thatcherite victory over socialist politics. But stories of local authorities engaging with these issues still abounded, leading to further action by the Thatcher government. One of the most significant moves came in 1988, when the Conservatives introduced section 28 of the Local Government Act, which sought to “prohibit the promotion of homosexuality by local authorities”. It wasn’t until 2003 that the Blair government repealed it.', 'Of course, criticisms of the “loony left” – and the implicit accusation that too much attention was being devoted to the rights of minorities – weren’t exclusively the preserve of Conservatives. Many people in the Labour party also attacked sections of the left that supported these issues. In 1983, the gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell ran as the Labour candidate in the Bermondsey byelection. He was criticised by Labour party insiders, and said that the party leadership pressured him to keep quiet about his private life. Under Neil Kinnock, Labour still viewed gay rights as a minority issue that might not appeal to voters, while Kinnock and Roy Hattersley, Labour’s former deputy leader, opposed the party’s Black Sections, the movement established in 1983 to demand greater representation for African Caribbean and Asian people.', 'There are clear parallels between criticisms of the “loony left” in the 1980s and the labelling of movements such as Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion as “woke” in the present day. In both eras, Conservative politicians and sections of the British press have demonised leftwing movements and portrayed them as worrisome forces attempting to infiltrate national institutions. While the right sought to rid local authorities of the “loony left” in the 1980s, they’re now raising the alarm over the alleged creep of “wokeness” in cultural institutions such as the BBC and the National Trust.', 'As the political theorist Lea Ypi wrote last year, this culture war is stoking fears that Britain is threatened by leftwing “identity politics” that are harmful to a particular British way of life. Just as stories about the “loony left” gave credence to Thatcher’s war on local government in the second half of the 1980s, similar fear of “wokeness” and charges of “leftwing bias” or “virtue signalling” have legitimised the pressure that ministers have placed upon institutions such as the BBC.

The weather was hot and dry, and he was suffocating.', 'Here in Portugal the effects of climate change are increasingly visible: heatwaves that cause water shortages and affect food production, and violent wildfires that give us anxiety. Sometimes I think, if climate change is already so extreme, what will it be like in the near future if we do nothing about it? So one of the most important reasons I’m involved in this case is to help my little brother have a good future, along with my parents, myself and the next generation.', 'Right now, the courts have told the governments that they need to reply by the end of May.

The case was filed in December 2019, but has not progressed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.', 'We filed this lawsuit because the state does not really develop national policies to protect the environment. By raising our voice as children and teens, we can make the state listen to us and develop more concrete measures to combat climate change.', 'We were inspired by Greta Thunberg and the idea that children and teenagers can make a difference.

As young people of colour, we found that frustrating. But I am hopeful this can change because young people are becoming more aware of the intersectionality of climate justice.', 'There is a growing understanding that it is not just as simple as “solving or fixing” climate change – there is a whole system, a whole multitude of other issues around racial and social justice that are intertwined with the climate crisis. Choked Up aims to make those connections and foreground the experiences of young people of colour.

It was all of these things that came together.', 'This was before Fridays for Future, before Greta Thunberg started striking. Youth climate mobilisations were not in vogue.

From I Am Legend to 28 Days Later, the depopulated city is axiomatic of catastrophe.', 'No people in a space designed for them is disturbing, but that doesn’t mean crowds have always been regarded with favour. There are as many different types of crowd as there are moods, from the mob that stormed the Capitol last January to the uniformed commuters pouring out of London’s Liverpool Street Station in their dark suits and shining shoes. A crowd might resemble the well-fed bourgeoisie of Seurat or Renoir, replete bodies in orderly pursuit of leisure, or the chaotic dispossessed of Goya’s paintings. A crowd might be angry or exuberant, vengeful or terrified. As we return tentatively to proximity and embrace, it’s illuminating to peer back at the massed bodies of the past, to see how artists, thinkers and politicians have experienced and interpreted the crowd, as well as how the crowd has understood itself.', 'Lean in among the guests at Bruegel’s The Wedding Dance, with their scarlet jerkins and scrubbed white aprons, and nearly every reveller’s face is distinct. This man gurns, eyes crossed; this one, blushing hard, steals a kiss. There are expressions of deviousness, stances of aggression and seduction beneath the trembling summer trees. All of life, you might say, is here, and yet the medieval crowd is different from the modern in that it is primarily a group of people familiar to one another. It was the great shift to the cities that brought about the proximity to strangers that we now experience as a crucial element of crowd dynamics.', 'This crowd is an artefact of modernity, at once generated and serviced by the machine age. This crowd travels by train, then plane; this crowd is illuminated in ghoulish pools of artificial light, which opened up the after-dark hours and made whole new vistas available to the eye. This crowd works in factories and takes its pleasure at the weekend. This crowd is turbulent and shifting: now mods fighting rockers, now ravers on pills, now miners on strike, now the doomed demonstrators gathering in their Sunday best at what would become known as Peterloo.', 'Among the first to document the modern crowd’s newly awesome density was the Victorian painter William Frith. In The Derby Day, a gargantuan work made between 1856 and 1858, the assorted revellers gathered on the hill above Epsom racecourse are the product of industrial urban labour, no matter how bucolic the scene appears. These individuals are just as bent on pleasure, mischief and misrule as Bruegel’s peasants, but they are emphatically strangers to one another, their brief respite from urban life facilitated by the railway, which reached Epsom nine years before Frith began his painting and which he later made the explicit subject of another of his virtuosic crowd scenes.', 'The heaving, surging crowd was the object of fascination and disquiet, widely considered unpredictable and capable of concealing dangerous elements (“a crowd of roaring blackguards,” an MP said of the Epsom revellers in 1880). In his painting, Frith, a believer in phrenology, depicted what he regarded as the hopelessly deviant bodies of criminals and the poor, from the pickpocket snaffling a watch to the beggarly children who watch in longing as a footman prepares a feast of boiled lobster.', 'Five years after Frith completed the last brushstrokes of The Derby Day, the poet Baudelaire wrote a famous essay that took a seemingly very different attitude to the massed bodies of strangers. In The Painter of Modern Life, he established the figure of the flâneur, the urban wanderer. “The crowd is his element,” it begins, “as the air is that of birds and water of fishes.” (Later, in the prose-poem Crowds, Baudelaire wrote of taking “a bath of multitude”.) Here the crowd is not sinister or dangerous, but instead a live element, pulsing and electric, appreciated by the solitary connoisseur, who longs “to set up house at the heart of the multitude”, and yet who remains outside, a perennially estranged watcher and witness.', 'What is happening here, to the real people who make up the body of the crowd? They’ve become a kind of living backdrop, transformed from individuals into a tapestry or chorus, a blur of colour and sound. It’s the same transformation the commuters on the Paris Métro undergo to become Ezra Pound’s “petals on a wet black bough”, at once aestheticised and dehumanised by the overwhelming density and scale of modern life. For these artists, joining the crowd could mean experiencing a sublime dissolution, but at the perennial risk of becoming less than human.', 'Pound would become a fascist, and his attitude is not unrelated to the way that fascists viewed the masses as raw material, in need of sifting and moulding (Goebbels characterised the relationship as that of a painter to his paints). Part of the fascist route to power was to convert the energy of the crowd into a disciplined force under the sway of a leader: a mass of humans stripped of their individuality, marching in lockstep, cogs in a formidable machine.', 'This is among the most frightening crowds to witness, though it clearly offers considerable pleasure to at least some of its participants. It’s also a crowd most effectively represented by the aerial gaze of cinema, so adept at conveying the visual shock of scale, the same form multiplied a thousand times. Take, for instance, the cowed workers in Fritz Lang’s Metropolis, no longer capable of resistance or refusal, or the wheeling, uniformed formations in Leni Riefenstahl’s glamorising 1935 documentary The Triumph of the Will. Indeed, the Nuremberg rallies were explicitly designed as a spectacle for Riefenstahl’s camera, to convey individuality utterly subsumed by Nazi ideology to crowds not yet perhaps under its spell.', 'But isn’t something missing from this account? What does it feel like to be in a crowd, thrust cheek by jowl against the sweating bodies of strangers? What about carnival? What about raves and protests, what about circuit parties and darkrooms, or cruising? What about the 25,000 people who marched from Selma to Montgomery in support of African American voting rights, or the Stonewall riots, where drag queens armed themselves with bricks and fought back against police harassment? As I was writing this, a crowd in Glasgow surrounded an immigration removal van that had arrested two men and refused to let it pass, chanting “let our neighbours go” until they were released. Oh, there are many ways of experiencing a crowd, and many things a crowd can do!', 'My most memorable childhood crowd was marching at Gay Pride in the late 1980s, jubilant at being part of such a traffic-stopping, formidably defiant body. Later, as an indie kid, I indulged in the high-risk sport of crowd surfing, leaping from the stage and waiting for the hands of strangers to tumble me aloft, or not.', 'A crowd is a way of smashing out of the confines of the individual body, that little prison. Look at the dancers in Mark Leckey’s melancholy love letter to club culture, Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore. It’s like peering into a rock pool, watching the feet move in unison, the bodies float and sway, entranced. No one is in charge. Patterns develop and shift spontaneously, though the skilled orator or performer is adept at channelling these eddies into ocean-going waves (Nina Simone, that consummate magician of crowd dynamics, once compared it to mesmerising “a giant animal”, as a toreador mesmerises a bull).', 'It’s no coincidence that one of the greatest works of crowd analysis arose from the experience of being inside one. On 15 July 1927, a demonstration in Vienna turned into a massacre when the police began to fire on tens of thousands of unprotected marchers and bystanders, using dumdum bullets. The future Nobel Laureate Elias Canetti, then a 22-year-old chemistry student, heard an uncanny roaring, and went into the streets to investigate. “I did not feel as if I were moving on my own legs,” he wrote later. “I felt as if I were in a resonant wind.”', 'His experiences that day made a nonsense of the theories he’d read about crowd behaviour. It was all very well for Freud and Gustave Le Bon to write about the violence and irrationality of the crowd as a threat to civilisation, but what he had encountered was the crowd’s immense dignity. Joining that almighty we had felt ecstatic, almost sublime. The realisation that the crowd was a living being, and one that had been mistrusted and maligned throughout history, drove his enormous, unclassifiable work of nonfiction, Crowds and Power.', 'Canetti contested the widely held belief that the crowd was automatically primitive and irrational, the opposite of the composed and articulate individual. Crowds might not use language, but that didn’t mean they weren’t communicating subtle ideas. Crowds offered people the chance for contact, intimacy, excitement, action. They were democracy in the raw, a site of visceral and sometimes mysterious intelligence – though there’s no doubt that crowds can be more stupid than their individual participants, and also more cruel.', 'As Canetti had seen on the streets of Vienna, crowds are often punished by the state, especially when they’ve assembled to demand rights, or their presence is interpreted as a threat to social order. From Peterloo to Black Lives Matter, demonstrations can have the unwelcome consequence of inducing a tightening of the reins, an increase in restriction and control. When I was involved in environmental activism in the 1990s, protest was made more perilous by the passage of a repressive new law. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 gave the police powers to prevent unauthorised camping and trespass, and created the new offence of aggravated trespass, which would soon be used widely in the policing of road protesters, hunt saboteurs and strikers.', 'This law was created in direct response to Castlemorton, a spontaneous three-day rave on common land in the Malvern Hills, and it was infamous for attempting to criminalise the music itself, defined as “the emission of a succession of repetitive beats”. It might have sounded ridiculous, but it licensed the police to disperse open-air gatherings and meant organisers risked fines and prison sentences for putting on free parties.', 'I was at the “kill the bill” protests in 1994, including the epic party in Trafalgar Square, to which the KLF turned up with a sound system in a tank, and so it was with a feeling of deja vu that I first read about the Police, Crime and Sentencing bill, currently passing through committee stage in the House of Commons. This bill was explicitly devised to combat the effectiveness of demonstrations by Black Lives Matter in 2020 and Extinction Rebellion, which gridlocked London twice in 2019. It represents the latest sally in a centuries-long attempt to relegate the need for communal rights below the demand for communal order.', 'Over the past frightening, sequestered year, I have been dogged by two crowd scenes in particular. The first is Henry Moore’s Shelter Drawings, made at the dead centre of the second world war. They document the disquieting sight of hundreds of sleepers in London tube stations, which had been repurposed as communal shelters during the blitz of 1940-41. Two rows of reclining, eyeless bodies fill a tunnel, tidy as pilchards. A man lies tented beneath a green blanket, one arm akimbo, mouth agape. Privacy is annihilated. Even his teeth are visible. A mother sits in vigil with her baby, surrounded by dozens of unconscious bodies. They could be corpses, each heavy dreamer de-individualised by catastrophe.', 'I’m wary of making common cause with the past, but the sense of waiting feels familiar. Life on hold, a long night, not knowing what absences await in the outside world. As the original National Gallery catalogue explained of Tube Shelter Perspective, “It is a terrifying vista of recumbent shapes, pale as all underground life tends to be pale; regimented, as only fear can regiment; helpless yet tense, safe yet listening, uncouth, uprooted, waiting in the tunnel for the dawn to release them.”', 'The second image is Nicole Eisenman’s 2008 painting Coping. If Moore’s figures are all the same, this crowd is radiantly individual. They are walking through the streets of a small town, with mountains in the distance. It could be Switzerland. Each character seems to have wandered in from a different era of art history. There’s a mummy wrapped in bandages, while the man in the foreground, his face pancake white, could be an off-duty acrobat from a rose-period Picasso, though he’s managed to score a takeaway coffee on his way out. A banker trudges past. A parrot hitches a ride on a cat. A diminutive cartoon cop trails a Lautrecian nude. The only thing that unites them is that they’re wading through a river of shit.', 'I recognise us in that crowd, too. Aren’t we in it together, up to our necks, trapped in the outflow pipe of history? As our face masks betray, we’re mortally vulnerable to one another, dependent on strangers every day. “Better together”, “stronger together”, “in it together”: these are phrases spun by politicians who are no better than Frith’s pickpockets, rifling the public purse. The mob who stormed the Capitol thought they were the people, even as they undermined the people’s right to vote, and yet I can’t help founding my dreaming of tomorrow on a vision of an “us”. Not a radiant host, perhaps, but the scrappy figures of a Lowry painting, stuttering into proximity, maybe even fellowship at last.', 'Olivia Laing’s latest book, Everybody: A Book About Freedom, is published by Pan Macmillan, £20.

The Everything But the Girl star is fighting to save a nature reserve in the heart of the city. As his new album Storm Shelter is released, we join him for some birdwatching', 'Cetti’s warbler!” says Ben Watt suddenly, raising a finger to indicate the new addition to the ambient soundscape. Listen, he says, to the opening “chi” followed by what sounds “almost like a little typewriter going off”. Watt does that, interrupts himself, or the silence if he’s not talking, to announce a new bird he’s seen or heard. “Blackcap!” he’ll exclaim. “Chiffchaff!”', 'We’re sitting in a bird hide overlooking a reed bed and an expanse of water on a gorgeous spring day. A heron stands, still as a photo, two metres in front of us. It could be rural East Anglia – apart from the roar of traffic and the giant arched structure in the background. These are, respectively, the A406 north circular and Wembley Stadium. And the place we’re at is the Welsh Harp reservoir, named after a pub that no longer exists.', 'Watt – musician, singer, songwriter, DJ, remixer, label owner, one half (with his wife Tracey Thorn) of Everything But the Girl – might seem like an unlikely birder, but it was probably inevitable. If the music came from his father, Scottish jazz band leader Tommy Watt, then the birds and nature came from his mother, journalist Romany Bain, a lover of the natural world. She signed Ben up to the RSPB when he was seven, got him books. “It does stick,” he says. Yeah, I suggest, but birdwatching’s not very rock’n’roll, is it? “Erm,” he says patiently. “I think that solitary contemplative thing – there is that side to all rock’n’rollers. They need a place to think.”', 'These two strands – music and nature – have run through his life, intertwining at times. On Box Hill, the opening track on Watt’s debut album written when he was 18 or 19, is a snapshot of an afternoon spent at a place he used to go with his parents. “There was a restorative power to being in nature on a sunny day I wanted to write about even then.”', 'When EBTG went into a self-imposed hiatus at the turn of the century, Watt, like the grebes here on the reservoir, dived below the surface, immersing himself in the world of electronic music production and DJing, before emerging somewhere different, but not far from where he started out. His 2014 comeback album, Hendra, a contemplative return to his folk-rock roots, has more of nature’s restorative power. A song called Golden Ratio is about how easy it is to get wrapped up in self-absorption and negativity even when a lovely day on the Dorset cliffs is staring you in the face. Matthew Arnold’s Field, meanwhile, is about scattering his dad’s ashes in Oxfordshire.', '“It’s often a background to the songs. You know, big nature – what was it Wordsworth called it? Immutability. That sort of affectlessness of nature that it is just there doing its thing regardless of what we are doing. And I suppose that’s why I don’t feel particularly sentimental about it. I’m awestruck by it, because it’s just doing its thing and we either respect it or we fuck it up.”', 'Tracey Thorn doesn’t share all her husband’s hobbies. “She doesn’t like birdwatching at all, but she loves walking and she loves plants so we can gel on a walk, with me looking up and her looking at her feet.”', 'Last December, Watt, who is now 58, released an album called Storm Damage: a mid-life record maybe, melancholic certainly, but not maudlin. He had started a UK tour with his trio when Covid struck. The London show was cancelled hours before they were due to go on. Then the America leg was suspended, as was Japan and Australia. “It really hit me for six,” he says. But Watt found some solace here at the Welsh Harp. He hadn’t been for a while and was struck by its state. “First I thought, ‘Oh, it’s kind of gritty and urban.’ Then I just looked out one day – at the wheelie bins and the neglect, the tideline of microplastic – and thought, ‘This is actually really bad. I need to look into this.’”', 'The Welsh Harp has a colourful history. Constructed in the early 1800s to feed the Grand Union Canal, the reservoir became a fashionable centre for recreational boating. The Old Welsh Harp was a popular pub and music venue. Churchill is said to have had a seaplane parked on the water during the war, ready to whisk him away from his bunker in nearby Dollis Hill. Then in the 1950s it was granted site of special scientific interest status, for its breeding, nesting and migrant birds and wildlife.', 'But years of neglect and underfunding have left it struggling to breathe. The true horror of the situation was brought into focus earlier this year when the water level was lowered to reveal a hellish porridge of supermarket trolleys, tyres, traffic cones, fridges embedded in the silt. Watt photographed it, blogged about it, badgered the local authorities, got involved with clean-ups. “We won’t get anywhere if we maintain a human-centric view of life,” he says. “The damage we are doing to places, with waste and casual plastic disposal, will contribute to the end of us. I think you just have to call it out.” It became, almost accidentally, a campaign.', 'At the same time, Watt has been putting the finishing touches to a new six-track mini-album, a stripped back piano-vocal companion piece to Storm Damage called Storm Shelter, which includes a couple of covers: Ten City’s house classic That’s the Way Love Is and Sharon Van Etten’s recent synth torch song Comeback Kid, as well as four of his own compositions. He thought of abandoning it when Covid struck. “But there’s something about them that felt quite raw, self-reliant, which I saw as things we’ve needed recently.”', 'In 1992, as detailed in his memoir Patient, Watt was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune condition called EGPA. It cost him most of his small intestine, and might have killed him. So he has been shielding from the beginning of the pandemic, living separately from Thorn and his 23-year-old twin daughters at home, using a different bathroom and eating at a different time. But he still managed to go wandering on his own.', 'As well as the ecological destruction, he saw other signs of crisis by the shores of the Welsh Harp. A new waterside development has displaced residents from an old estate, or left them in poor living conditions. “Also, I think there is an issue with eastern European migrant workers coming in and getting trapped in low-paid jobs. Some were just camping by the reservoir because it’s all they could afford. I was coming across abandoned sleeping camps.” He’s donating an advance on album royalties to the homelessness charity Shelter.', 'Listening to Watt’s records, you might think he was a moody bugger, but he doesn’t seem to be one to wallow. When he survived his illness, “a lot of people said, ‘Oh, life must be that much more meaningful now, the sky must be bluer.’ I didn’t actually feel much of that. I just felt annoyed that I had been ill and that it interrupted my life.”', 'He is bringing the same practicality to the Welsh Harp and the issues that concern him. He sets out to understand, highlight, do something. He has had periods of depression, times when his mental health has suffered. “So anything that helps lever yourself out of those moments, something you draw strength from, is of value.” For him, nature (especially birds) is that thing. “It helps you be in the now, which is important. It doesn’t ask much of you, just does its thing.” He points at the heron. “He’s been here this whole time. It’s beautiful. He’s not fazed by any of this nonsense I’m talking.” And he laughs.', 'The new mini album Storm Shelter is out now on Unmade Road.']",['Sam Wollaston'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/416cb195b62519cc0002f77acecc0f1428d558e5/272_349_4702_2821/master/4702.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', '‘I’m awestruck by it’ … Watt gazes out over Welsh Harp reservoir, where Churchill is said to have kept a seaplane.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e57e37534a310136214d760dec7a0bf26a692f3/1264_0_2970_3712/master/2970.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Restorative power … a coot at Welsh Harp reservoir.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59e7b92b86453139f5ff516a43c019674805a55b/0_142_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Plastic pollution at the Welsh Harp.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8929d73f2bd3fa0e12bdf56cbb5665df726a9fe2/0_231_5452_3272/master/5452.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Welsh Harp reservoir in north west London.']]",

But in 2019 the Queensland supreme court found against TRG, the first Lynch victim to seek an order setting aside his earlier settlement and allowing him to pursue further damages from Brisbane Grammar.', 'Justice Peter Davis found that in mediation with TRG’s legal representatives in 2002, the school had fairly taken into account conflicting accounts from the former headmaster Max Howell, who swore an affidavit to say he had known nothing of Lynch’s abuse, and evidence from one former student and the parent of another who said Howell had explicitly been told of the abuse as early as 1980. After hearing a range of evidence from both parties, Davis decided it would not be “just and reasonable” to set aside the settlement, a decision the appeal court upheld.', 'Howell, who died in 2011, said in a 2002 affidavit: “At no time did I ever receive any complaint from students, staff, parents or any other person, in relation to Lynch’s behaviour.”', 'But the royal commission heard confronting evidence of Lynch’s abuse, including from a witness who alleged Howell had referred him to Lynch in 1980 and that in 1982 Howell had entered into Lynch’s counselling room where he saw the boy naked.', 'The witness, known by the initials BQA, said Howell had seen him with his trousers and underpants down in Lynch’s office, castigated him and sent him back to class.', '“BQA said that Howell told him he was a ‘sick individual, or words to that effect’ and told him to return to class,” the royal commission reported.', 'In its findings the royal commission explicitly rejected Howell’s claim in the affidavit, accepting the evidence that Howell had been told of Lynch’s abuse by a parent in 1981.', '“Howell did not investigate the allegations and did not report the matter to police or the board of trustees.

Students who reported Lynch’s abuse were often scorned as “losers” by their peers.', '“As long as his victims could be derided by the elitist elements in the student body, Lynch knew he was safe,” Jon says.', 'The royal commission found that when Howell was headmaster “there was a culture at Brisbane Grammar where boys who made allegations of sexual abuse were not believed and allegations were not acted upon”.', 'In 1985 Jon was an academically gifted student in year 11 but, when he was referred to Lynch for counselling after his parents separated, his marks plummeted.', 'Jon remembers challenging Lynch’s “counselling” methods of undressing him and performing sex acts.

From self-determination to international trade to “a world free from want and fear”, its ambitions were lofty and its goals expansive. We live today with its legacy.', 'Some 80 years on, Boris Johnson and Joe Biden signed what was termed a “new Atlantic charter” ahead of the G7 meeting in Cornwall. But the new Atlantic charter reflects the diminished status of both the US and Britain in the 21st century. It set out some sensible areas for bilateral cooperation – from quantum computing to air travel – but there was little of lasting note. These were not two world leaders charting the future for humankind, nor indeed for post-Brexit Britain: there was not even a promise of a US-UK trade deal.', 'Meeting in person for the first time since the pandemic began, the self-styled “group of seven leading industrialised nations” had enormous problems on the agenda: bringing the pandemic to an end, ensuring the world economy recovers rapidly and accelerating action on the climate crisis. But the magnitude of the problems was not matched by the scale of the response.', 'The G7 promised to release 1bn doses of vaccine to the world’s poorest countries. But as the International Monetary Fund has pointed out, these are simply the doses that have been ordered but are surplus to their needs. This was not a group of leaders making sacrifices for the sake of the world. With the costs of the pandemic estimated to be $28tn, it is incomprehensible that the G7 failed to deliver a serious plan to produce, distribute and finance vaccines globally.', 'In truth, we are in a leaderless world. President Biden has returned the US to diplomatic respectability, recommitting to its international obligations and alliances. But while he aims to be a transformative president at home, his ambitions abroad are limited and largely a return to foreign policy orthodoxy. The rest of the world simply isn’t a priority.', 'The real achievement of note came before the summit rather than at it, with a global agreement on corporation tax. This was mainly a spillover benefit from Biden’s domestic priorities: he is the first president in half a century to seek to correct the gross imbalance between the power and rewards that flow to workers versus those that go to shareholders. Fairer taxation is crucial to accomplish that rebalancing.', 'The reality is that the US is no longer the unrivalled power it was in the period immediately after the fall of the Berlin Wall. There was some trolling of China – pushing the “lab-leak” theory on the origins of Covid – but for the most part, the US needs Pacific partners to help it contain China, not European ones. The goal of containment tickles nostalgia-pickled British politicians, but there is little of substance that they bring to the table.', 'Indeed, for many countries, attempting to determine world affairs without the world’s second largest economy at the table is a throwback to the cold war era, when far less of the global economy was internationally traded. While a new anti-China consensus has been forged in Washington – in substance, Biden’s policy towards Beijing differs little from Trump – there is little appetite for most countries to be caught between two powers vying for supremacy.', 'Meanwhile “Global Britain” is best understood through the looking-glass: the government’s actions are the inverse of its rhetoric. Britain is in dispute with its nearest neighbours over the Northern Ireland protocol, having already diminished its influence by leaving the EU. It has slashed foreign aid in the middle of a global crisis, reneging on obligations from medication for people living with HIV to schooling for impoverished children. It seeks every opportunity to undermine the BBC, which gives Britain reach around the world. Global Britain is peculiarly parochially minded.', 'Over the past 18 months, the pandemic has reaffirmed the centrality of nation states in human affairs, with little international coordination and the sidelining of multilateral institutions.

This one of course does that but it introduces a new non-anthropocentric approach, namely putting the environment at the heart of international law, and so that is original and innovative.', '“For me the single most important thing about this initiative is that it’s part of that broader process of changing public consciousness, recognising that we are in a relationship with our environment, we are dependent for our wellbeing on the wellbeing of the environment and that we have to use various instruments, political, diplomatic but also legal to achieve the protection of the environment.”', 'An ecocide law has been mooted for decades, with the late Swedish prime minister, Olof Palme, pushing the concept at the 1972 UN environmental conference in Stockholm.

But they stressed that they would need more time to digest the 400-page document before outlining a formal policy response.', 'Multi-partisan legislation passed by Ardern in 2019 means the government is legally obliged to consider and create a policy plan based on the commission’s advice, which it will release before the end of year.', 'The report laid out pathways for New Zealand to meet its greenhouse gas reduction obligations by 2050. They include wide-scale agricultural reform to reduce methane emissions, dropping herd sizes by 10%-15%, ending imports of combustion-engine cars, eliminating new household gas connections, and less travel by car overall. Some of those changes would need to be dramatic transformations: to meet its goal for transport emissions, New Zealand would need to increase electric vehicle share of the market to 50% in the next 10 years. It is now around 1-2%.', 'At the release of the commission’s advice, Ardern said the report was “one of the most significant documents I’ll receive in my time as prime minister”.', 'She also noted that the path ahead would be challenging for New Zealand. “Having a roadmap doesn’t change the fact the road will be steep and tough at times,” she said.', 'Ardern emphasised in her speech that “meeting our climate targets is achievable and affordable with existing technology”, and outlined progress the government had already made. But hitting its climate goals will require a total reversal of New Zealand’s current trajectory. New Zealand is one of the world’s worst performers on emission increases. Its emissions rose by 57% between 1990 and 2018 – the second greatest increase of all industrialised countries. Earlier this year, data showed that New Zealand’s emissions had increased by 2% in 2018-19.', 'That increase means the commission’s advice had changed from its earlier drafts – it is now calling for steeper, earlier cuts to emissions than it had in January.', 'The plan will require changes across every part of New Zealand life. In agriculture, some of the work to reduce methane emissions could be done through improved farm practices and breeding animals that produced less gas – but the commission found it would also require a drop in the number of total herd numbers by 10%-15%.', 'The country would need to end imports of fossil-fuel-powered cars by 2030-35, and transition to electric vehicles. Ardern said the government was taking action to make them more affordable – including switching the government fleet to electric cars to create a secondhand market, and creating a new incentives regime. The 2021 budget released in May put aside about $300m for incentives to try to boost electric vehicle uptake, but did not provide details on how the program would look.', 'The commission’s draft advice had prompted fears that New Zealanders may lose access to the beloved sausage sizzles on gas barbecues, which some consider a fixture of Kiwi culture. The commission took a moment to specifically refute that claim.', '“Many submitters were concerned the advice would mean a ‘ban on gas barbecues’ and strongly opposed that. No recommendations were made about banning fossil gas barbecues.”', 'The commission’s advice was also clear about failings of policy in the past, which had not put New Zealand on a lower-emissions trajectory – and warned that relying on forest-planting offsets to reduce net emissions would not be enough. “Instead of putting policies in place to decarbonise the economy … Aotearoa used forests planted in the 1990s to offset its emissions and meet its targets,” it said. “The carbon removal benefits of these forests are now coming to an end.”', 'Shaw said the government was taking action, and had done more on climate in the past three-and-a-half years than the past three-and-a-half decades of governments combined. “Is it enough? No.” he said.', '“We are yet to see a sustained decline in the pollution we put into the atmosphere. And even when we do, we need to ensure that decline continues and, in fact, picks up pace every year.”', 'The commission modelled both the cost of its recommended changes, and the cost of doing nothing. The cost of the recommended changes would amount to about 1.2% of GPD by 2050. But delaying action on the climate crisis would end up costing the economy more, with GDP in 2050 falling by about 2.3%. In both cases, that cost described a reduction of economic growth.', 'Ardern said the modelling showed that “acting now makes more economic sense than waiting, and that we can reduce emissions while continuing to grow the economy”.', 'The commission sets out goals for net reductions in emissions, including an 18% drop in net carbon dioxide from 2019 levels by 2025, 47% below 2019 by 2030 and 78% by 2035. Biogenic methane, the gas broadly produced by agricultural animals, must drop 8% by 2025, 12% by 2030, 17% by 2035.', 'The report comes as the world’s major democracies are increasing commitments, and pressuring others to do the same, to cut emissions this decade, as the science says is necessary. The topic will be a major focus at the G7 summit in Cornwall later this week.

At that time, he said, the official Sage – the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies – were refusing to disclose minutes of its meetings and even the names of its members. This has subsequently changed as a result of pressure by the independent alternative.', '“I’ve been amazed by the response to Independent Sage,” King said. “All 12 members have become media personalities. I hope we get the same level of interest for the climate group.”', 'The focus will be different. While Independent Sage has pushed for more transparency in pandemic decision-making, the Climate Crisis Advisory Group will press for more urgency. Currently, there is a large amount of data from the IPCC and in academic journals about the long-term risks of global heating, but little in the way of rapid response to new developments.', 'A draft launch statement warns the Earth may have already passed several dangerous tipping points, including melting ice sheets, the slowdown of Atlantic circulation and the dieback of the Amazon rainforest, which highlight the need for speed. “Only by acting quickly and robustly will we be able to stabilise climatic conditions, ensure a just transition and protect vital biodiversity and ecosystem functions for the next generation,” the statement says.', 'The new body highlights growing concern among scientists and world bodies that global climate action is too slow. Earlier this year, 126 Nobel laureates declared a planetary emergency. Last month, the International Energy Agency said exploitation and development of new oil and gas fields must stop this year if the world is to stay within safe limits of global heating and meet the current goal of net zero emissions by 2050.', 'The draft statement says ambition needs to be raised still higher. “Net zero greenhouse emissions by 2050 is no longer enough to halt the climate crisis and we need to reach carbon net zero by 2035 to 2040,” it says.', 'King said that discussions with other panel members had showed how rapidly things can change even in the short term.

As she grapples with the fear of what her peers might think of her passion for the environment and her determination to have her voice heard, we gain an intimate and intergenerational perspective of what it really means to move a family off grid.', 'The film was made with the support of the BFI Doc Society Fund and the Climate Story Labs. The filmmakers, Joya Berrow and Lucy Jane, set out with the clear objective of making the entire production carbon conscious. The Tinkers Bubble community is committed to living fossil-fuel free and has been beyond carbon neutral for 25 years. We find out more about its approach to sustainable filmmaking and the lessons learned along the way.', 'A wonderful series of events led us to Tinkers Bubble and meeting the Tizard family. Joya grew up in Dorset around the small-scale farmers and campaigners Mary & Jyoti Fernandes, who had lived and brought their families up in Tinkers Bubble before moving to Dorset. It has always been a place on Joya’s radar growing up.', 'One spring day when we went to visit with Mary, the community members were busy with their daily lives and working the land. We instantly gelled with Eve, who took us under her wing and showed us around. She was particularly excited about her favourite parts of the forest - the curly tree which she climbed, the death swing and the inner forest trampoline.', 'It was inspiring to see her positive interactions with nature and the intergenerational community around her. Living in the forest had helped bring out a deep appreciation of the environment in Eve, and we instantly recognised how special that was. After that day, we knew that we wanted to collaborate with her to tell her story, so we set about organising further visits. On those subsequent trips we really got to know her family though helping with daily activities such as planting and harvesting vegetables.', 'We have always felt passionately about shining a light on alternative living and really admired the commitment of the community at Tinkers Bubble to sustainable living, activism and dedication to the climate movement.', 'We met Eve and her family at such a pivotal point in their lives, having only moved to the community a few months prior. They were still adjusting to their new, more slowly paced way of living and were ironing out challenges of living in a community. It seemed like a strong time of reflection for them, particularly for Eve’s parents, Kirsty and Nick, so it felt like a valuable time to capture and share.', 'We realised that the family’s story was relatable on many levels, and for many types of viewer, young or old. We were inspired by their commitment to the climate movement but the emotional and practical trials and tribulations of actually moving off grid provided an honest and human narrative to the story. We knew the film would challenge an often stereotypical or misunderstood representation of alternative living, and saw how Eve and her family had the power to encourage viewers to connect with nature and consider more sustainable daily choices. As Kirsty says in the film: “Obviously this is the most extreme way of self-sustainability that isn’t going to suit everybody, but every little change we make can help the world, and we can only start with small steps.”', 'We saw the wider context of the film as a powerful tool for an impact campaign with integrity too. The Youth Climate movement has become an increasingly loud voice in activism and we saw how Eve could play an important role as a powerful British role model for young people. In forming a strong bond with her and her 11-year-old sister Verity, we saw how vital it is to make the voices of young people heard. They are the future stewards of this planet and their opinions are so important. We can learn a lot from the way that young people think and feel about this world.', 'Well, it’s hard to say that Eve was definitely the first, but it is probable and we were certainly the first to record our process of making it carbon neutral. We are using the project as a case study for other filmmakers who want to work in a greener way, providing information and tips.', 'We enjoyed collaborating with Doc Society in the process, calculating our carbon footprint in a log that covered every element of production. We also put budget aside to offset the final impact of the film. We continued to work with Doc Society to help put together a sustainable production checklist, which is available online. Our sustainable approach was spearheaded by Theo Gainzvelles.', 'Cosmo’s music brings the film alive. We knew we wanted to use his music before we had even shot the film, and it became a guiding energy throughout the filming process. He had made an incredible album called Wake Up Calls, using the calls of endangered British birds, and the rich texture of the songs really reflects the array of sounds that exist at Tinkers Bubble. He uses lots of recordings of natural sounds, animals and environments in his tracks.', 'The playful energy of his music mixed with the emotional narrative that runs through each song embodies Eve’s character and the emotional journey that we go on with her throughout the film. Cosmo is a brilliant artist. His authenticity and interest in the natural world is completely magnetic.', 'We made visits to the community over the course of about eight months, between July and February. We usually visited Eve and her family for a few days at a time so the whole filming process has become this amazing blur, watching Eve grow and develop as a person and seeing how her family continued to settle in at the Bubble. Being there for Eve’s first day back at school was very emotional for us all. We stood waving goodbye to a little anxious butterfly at the school gates, then witnessed this confident young human arrive back from school later with a massive smile on her face. It was so heartwarming.', 'It was also incredible to travel up to London with the family and watch Eve inspire a crowd of people at the climate protests. Watching her take on this amazing feat and stand up on stage after George Monbiot with her raw passion generated a unique and unforgettable energy in the air.', 'Making a carbon neutral film was a very significant lesson for us as filmmakers. We learned all about how a sustainable approach can be taken by mitigating the impact of production from the seed of the idea, as opposed to at the end when the damage has already been done. We realised the heavy consideration required both in budget and schedule, and recognised that a consciousness and patience was needed.

Cuixart, however, wants the central government to look beyond the next general election – due in 2023 – and to heed voices from Catalonia and beyond.', '“I was sent to prison for defending the exercise of fundamental rights, and I think if the Spanish government has let us out, it was through necessity and not generosity,” he told the Guardian while on his way home to see his wife and children.', '“I think international pressure, and pressure from Europe and Amnesty International, meant they had to let us out.”', 'Cuixart, 46, is already appealing against his conviction at the European court of human rights. Along with fellow civil society leader Jordi Sànchez, Cuixart was found guilty of sedition by Spain’s supreme court.

But the move remains deeply divisive among voters, among Sánchez’s political rivals – and even among those who have received the pardons.', 'The separatist leaders have vowed to carry on pushing for regional independence and say a blanket amnesty would have been preferable to the individual pardons. They also insist that an officially agreed referendum remains the best way to settled the vexed Catalan question.', 'Cuixart says that dialogue remains essential: “Our politicians here and in Madrid need to talk – that’s why people voted for them.” He also acknowledges that Sánchez’s gestures to date suggest a far more conciliatory approach to Catalonia than that of his conservative predecessor, Mariano Rajoy. But he brushes off suggestions that the Socialist-led government has a wholly new approach to the problem.', '“Forgive me, but after spending three years in prison under Pedro Sánchez and one year there under Rajoy, Pedro Sánchez had enough time to fix this,” said Cuixart.', '“It’s taken him three years – and that’s no small thing! OK, we’re out of prison and the tone from Pedro Sánchez is clearly not the one we heard from Mariano Rajoy … But we have to move from words to action.”', 'Like his fellow independence leaders, Cuixart points to a Scottish-style referendum as his greatest hope. “When Pedro Sánchez is David Cameron, maybe we’ll make some progress,” he said. “What Pedro Sánchez has to do is act bravely and not engage in short-term dodges. He has to think about future generations and not just about parliamentary stability over the next two years. I don’t want to presuppose that he won’t do that. We’re always open to dialogue.”', 'Although a majority of Catalans continue to oppose independence – the split is currently 48.7% against to 44.9% in favour, according to a recent poll – approximately 70% of people in Catalonia would like to see a referendum on the issue. Sánchez, however, has repeatedly ruled out a vote on secession, insisting that all negotiations must respect the law and the constitution.', '“Those jailed were never punished for their ideas, but for their actions against democratic legality,” the prime minister said on Tuesday. “A strong democracy like Spain’s doesn’t ask anyone to abandon their ideas, but it does require them to exercise them within the limits of the law and with respect towards all Spaniards.”', 'Cuixart declined to say whether he endorsed the view recently expressed by another of those pardoned, the former Catalan regional vice-president Oriol Junqueras. At the beginning of June, Junqueras wrote an article recognising the mistakes the independence movement had made and suggesting that unilateral efforts to secure independence were now “neither viable nor desirable”.', '“As part of Òmnium, I can’t say that I made a mistake by trying to pressure Catalan and Spanish politicians to let us vote,” said Cuixart. “I’ve pressured everyone by saying, ‘Please, we want to vote.’ That what Extinction Rebellion have done, that’s what gender equality campaigners have done. I’m an activist and the only way I have of getting people to listen to me is by pressuring politicians – peacefully and democratically.”', 'Asked whether he saw Catalan independence as a short-, medium- or long-term endeavour, Cuixart said the past four years had only reinforced his vision. “It’s a matter of exercising fundamental rights, which is what happened in Quebec, what’s happening in Scotland, and what happened in the UK with Brexit,” he said.', '“It’s about listening to the voice of the people.

Shortsightedness meant that the family interest in birds was hopeless for her – she couldn’t see them well enough. Over the years she taught me to look at all things creeping, opening up a world of bugs, beetles and parasitic wasps.', 'It struck Maggie that monitoring butterflies only in the countryside was missing a trick. In 2017, in Bristol, she created an urban butterfly transect to measure, by weekly survey, changes in the numbers and variety of butterflies in a set area. In addition, she initiated a conference programme looking at urban issues such as verge mowing management and wildlife gardening.', 'Maggie was a member of Ashley Vale Allotment Association. As the allotment’s first wildlife officer she promoted wildlife-friendly practices. With students from the University of the West of England she renovated a large pond. A motion sensitive camera was installed which revealed night-time visitors: badgers, foxes and deer.', 'Born in Wantage, Oxfordshire, Maggie was one of three daughters of Rachel (nee Bailey) and Basil Moss. When she was three our family moved to Redland, Bristol, where our father, a vicar, became a parish priest, then canon of Bristol Cathedral, and Maggie went to Fairfield school.', 'Later we moved to Dulwich, south London. Maggie went to Mary Datchelor girls’ school, Camberwell, then Loughborough College of Education, qualifying in 1974. Having taught at Weston All Saints primary school in Bath for some years, in 1978 she travelled overland, on her own, to India. The resulting increase in confidence, sense of independence and self-reliance she gained remained with her for the rest of life.', 'Maggie collaborated with our sister, Gemma, to write the groundbreaking Handbook for Women Travellers (1987). Translated into three languages, it offered practical advice for women travelling solo or together, covering how to stay safe and be culturally sensitive and eco-conscious. She subsequently worked with Tourism Concern to establish the Himalayan Tourist Code (1988).', 'Maggie met Mike Manson in 1979 at Bristol Polytechnic while training to be a careers adviser, and they married in 1984. She then worked for Avon Careers Service with young people who were excluded or failed by the education system.', 'Latterly she was employed as an outreach worker for further education colleges in Bristol, seeking to inform and link schools and students to the courses they offered.

Very rarely are things achieved at these summits. The best thing about them is the opportunity to laugh at the photographs, which somehow are even more excruciating than the usual political photo ops.', 'So, without further ado …', 'I’ve never related to anyone as much as I do to this little girl. During Boris Johnson’s trip to St Issey primary school, this poor wee lamb was clearly sacrificed to the photo op. She does not look happy about it. On the other hand, there’s a vibe of a sweet movie detailing the journey of a single father and his young charge, fending for themselves after the tragic death of, respectively, their wife and mother. Though Johnson in the role of responsible adult would clearly be a monumental departure.', 'Jill Biden’s jacket is widely assumed to be a rejoinder to Melania Trump’s one emblazoned with “I Really Don’t Care, Do U?”. It’s debatable how subtle capital diamanté letters are, but the sentiment of love is very much appreciated. Biden is a good egg; I like her a lot. That said, this blazer isn’t the sort of thing one would buy out of choice, but rather looks like an emergency purchase on a foreign holiday when caught out by the weather – the least awful item on the town square market.', 'I don’t know when it was that Justin Trudeau started morphing into Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, but it’s undeniable. Kind of makes you think that the Johnsons could have just enlisted his help rather than pay for – sorry, get someone else to pay for – their £200,000 Lulu Lytle flat renovation.', 'Not a still from Reservoir Dogs, but, in fact, the arrival of The Adults: Angela Merkel and her university professor husband, Joachim Sauer. Merkel is having a tough time and is on her way out in Germany, probably looking forward to a break from keeping control of the kindergarten that counts as the people who run the world.', 'Because Merkel is sensible and mostly competent, she is often unfairly portrayed as dull. Yet she’s always coming out with controlled, withering sass. Remember when Vladimir Putin tried to intimidate her with his dogs? Her response: “I understand why he has to do this – to prove he’s a man. He’s afraid of his own weakness.”', 'I don’t mean to be rude, but what is this backdrop? Because that looks rather like a painting of logs. Biden seems to be offering Johnson some sage advice here. Possibly: don’t stuff straws under your top lip and pretend to be a walrus over dinner, as I know you’re almost certainly planning to do, because you are a clown.', 'Some of you may recall that photograph in which Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter seemed Borrower-sized next to the Bidens, because of the unfortunate effects of a wide-angle lens. But this photograph rather suggests that it is Jill who is the size of a Monopoly piece.', 'This is the most awkward photograph of all time, but there is something endearing about it. Usually, G7 group photographs that involve tables are taken in stately dining halls, with gold chandeliers and snow-white tablecloths, but here we have European commission president Ursula von der Leyen, French president Emmanuel Macron, European Council president Charles Michel, Merkel and Italy’s prime minister, Mario Draghi, crammed around a picnic table. It almost certainly has a wobbly leg and a sticky surface. It is about half the size it needs to be. The authentic British experience.', 'I know people find protesters annoying, but various groups have absolutely knocked it out of the park in Cornwall. Yes, there are the usual Amazon-bought politician masks and blow-up Boris Johnsons, plus garb inspired by The Handmaid’s Tale – same old – but we’ve also been treated to Extinction Rebellion dressing as GIANT BLACKBIRDS doing some kind of play. Oh, and if you’re wondering if that’s a warship in the background, it is. Because this is the country we’re living in.', 'Here is a group of Pikachus on the beach in an attempt to get the Japanese government to stop burning coal by 2030. I would genuinely find this quite persuasive.', 'God bless you, sir. Taking Jill Biden’s message to heart.', 'I don’t quite understand the logic of putting a cut-down tree stump front and centre at a summit partly dedicated to saving the environment, but bear in mind that Johnson took a flight from London to Cornwall, so the message seems skewed all round.', 'Finally, thank God for the arrival of Brigitte Macron, the wife of Emmanuel, who is always the most entertaining presence at G7 summits. Yesterday, there was no sign of her; I quickly discovered she was in Paris hanging out with the French football star Kylian Mbappé.
