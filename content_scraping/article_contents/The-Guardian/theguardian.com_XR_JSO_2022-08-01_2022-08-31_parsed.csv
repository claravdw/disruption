I’m proud to have helped launch Extinction Rebellion (XR), which, along with Greta Thunberg, most facilitated that breakout. But does disruptive protest remain the only way forward?', 'Harris appears to suppose that the only alternatives are either to back the radical flank or to be, at best, timid incrementalists. But the emerging moderate-flank strategy supposes something different: that the most effective thing to do now – while not shying away from how grim things are – is to meet people where they are and bring the majority with us. The radical flank is not capable of doing this. It (we) briefly did in April-May 2019, but such wonderful moments are rare. There’s been such pushback against the radical flank that it’s not now credible to suppose that it can actually win.', 'If all eggs are put in the radical flank’s basket, with virtual certainty we will lose. If, however, we take advantage of the radical flank’s achievements and facilitate a much larger cohort to march through the window we opened, then even now, we might win. “Winning” will not be a smooth transition; it’s way too late for that. Winning now will be avoiding an uncontrolled civilisational collapse.', 'What is such a moderate flank looking like? It’s to be found in diverse post-XR places such as Wild Card (campaigning to rewild the UK), Purpose Disruptors (advertisers turning their “dark” arts to the purpose of good), Lawyers For Net Zero, and the emerging network of Climate Emergency Centres.

It was founded by organic farmer Roger Hallam, environmental campaigner Gail Bradbrook and a core of others in 2018, and among their first major actions was the blockading of four central London sites in April 2019 – a 10-day coup engrossingly chronicled in this documentary by Leigh Bloomfield, which should rightfully double up as a canny handbook on how to conduct civil disobedience.', 'At one point, a police officer impressively misses the point and reads out an inventory of the economic cost of the Waterloo bridge blockade to an indifferent-looking XR activist. The organisation was founded on the recognition that this level of disruption is needed to make governments act on climate change, and Bloomfield minutely documents the difficulties of sustaining such obstructionism in the field. As one campaigner recognises, it often boils down to “confidence”. In the moment, a ratcheting-up of police presence and a dip in morale can prove a tipping point, as we see when some stressed bridge protesters start retreating to the main Marble Arch site. There’s a lot for activists to learn in the strategic feints and readjustments on show here.', 'That XR managed to hold out in their London occupations for as long as they did is testimony to the sturdy logistics and strategy marshalled by Hallam, who has the soft-spoken, bureaucratic airs of a Morrison’s branch manager. But in the case of the dissipation of the final Marble Arch encampment, Bloomfield’s film doesn’t fully clarify if XR voluntarily jumped or were shoved by increasing pressure from the police. Amid the mounting fatigue, chaos and debates, another co-founder Stuart Basden hints at the perennial bugbear of protest movements the longer they persist: “We need some clarity about why we’re still here.”', 'Behind that is the broader question of how XR move forward and win converts beyond hardcore activists. Bloomfield’s brisk, upbeat sweep means the film doesn’t offer more than brief glances at the opportunities and hurdles on that front. Hopeful interactions with commuters are balanced by a concerned parent telling the organisers they need to be more transparent with their younger activists about legal risks. XR’s broader momentum levels are still the salient issue – especially after the enforced hiatus of the pandemic.

Its music is graceful, poised and smooth, but it is also an almost conceptual set of songs about the urgency of the climate crisis and the disorientation of living in a culture that still refuses to acknowledge it. According to its chief creator, the singer-songwriter and former actor Tamara Lindeman, many of its songs evoke what happens when “this veneer of ‘everything will be OK’ disappears”. That moment of revelation is perfectly captured in one song I have played over and over again – which is simply called Loss, and finds Lindeman recalling a conversation: “What was it last night she said? At some point you’d have to live as if the truth was true.”', 'Amid unprecedented temperatures, fires and the grim pantomime that will eventually end with the selection of our next prime minister, I suspect more people than ever would now understand those words as a matter of direct emotional experience. For millions of us, this summer’s heat is synonymous with an anxiety that is now impossible to shake off, and a renewed awareness of the small transgressions and outright hypocrisies that are required to get through each day. We perform them because of something that Lindeman’s lyrics consummately describe: that very human talent for just about averting our eyes from what is directly in front of us, so as to live a quiet life; and a political culture that just about keeps the “everything will be OK” veneer in place.', 'These are things evident across the planet, and the UK has its own grim versions of them. One of the two remaining Tory leadership candidates has pledged to retain the current de facto ban on onshore windfarms; the other wants to reconsider some of the key policies built into the government’s milquetoast 2050 net zero target (the positions of Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, respectively). The Labour party has one big climate policy – its £28bn-a-year climate investment pledge – but is still not putting global heating anywhere near the centre of its basic message, and is thereby failing to acquire much consent for action on it.', 'Meanwhile, for a certain kind of media voice, the past week has been all about raging against climate sceptics and deniers and their influence on politics, as if pointing out that they are mendacious and dangerous is an act of bravery. The former BBC presenter Andrew Marr provided a good example in a monologue broadcast on his new show on LBC: “I for one have had enough of being told by pallid, shadowy, old businessmen and lazy ignorant hacks and sleazy lobbyists – who aren’t real scientists, any of them – that the science is wrong and that what is happening isn’t happening,” he said. “Enough!”', 'The key question of 2022 is not whether those people are wrong, both factually and morally: we know the answer to that. For the moment, I don’t think many people need to be thinking very much about particular parties or politicians. What we surely need to focus on is the deep attachment to fossil fuels still locked into our economy and political system, and how to help the movements that definitely want to end it: Extinction Rebellion (XR), Insulate Britain, Just Stop Oil and the other forces that clearly understand the unspeakable gravity of the moment. This comes down to a question that still does not intrude on politics nearly enough: as these groups take the most direct kind of action, do you support them? And if – or, rather, as – the climate emergency deepens and the awful gap between politics and the sheer scale of what we are faced with only widens, what will you think if their actions take new, ever-more disruptive forms?', 'To some extent, the way our media and politicians fend off the climate crisis accidentally confronts people with exactly those arguments. In one of our most regular national rituals, mainstream politics barely intrudes and instead, a protester fresh from some or other climate action is berated by Piers Morgan, Richard Madeley or one of the presenters from GB News or TalkRadio, and the only real options become clear: meaningful and radical action or nothing at all. An editorial last week in the Sun insisted that “we need a sober debate, free from the extremists’ juvenile panic, on how we inch towards Net Zero in decades to come”, which made panic look like much the more sensible option. In April, the Labour party demanded that the government take legal action to effectively ban climate protests that disrupt traffic and oil production. When he stood to be his party’s leader, Keir Starmer took donations from a former boss of the RAC and AA, and the latter company-cum-lobby group’s former chief financial officer. The people he apparently thinks should be locked up, by contrast, are motivated by a comparatively pure mission to confront the car industry and quickly finish the hydrocarbon era, and thereby avoid catastrophe. So who do you choose?', 'In some cases – Occupy is a good example here – sustained support for protesters and activists has bumped up against their lack of a coherent agenda. But the modern climate movement is not like that. The basic position shared by the central handful of groups is clear enough: net zero by a much earlier date than 2050. XR and the people backing the climate and ecology bill – including such politicians as the Greens’ Caroline Lucas and Labour’s Clive Lewis – envisage that change being driven by citizens’ assemblies, set up to decide how such an aim will be reached. In the context of Westminster politics, such ideas may seem so unlikely as to be barely worth considering. But remember: Brexit is a madcap, massively disruptive project that defies just about every element of political and economic sense, but was until recently the preserve of cranks and obsessives and only became a reality when David Cameron decided to bypass MPs and ask the rest of us to decide. Less than a decade after it decisively burst into the political foreground, moreover, we are locked into it for keeps, with the support of both main parties. By comparison, is trying to set an example to other countries by doing exactly what the climate demands really so fanciful?', 'Activism and protest often trigger a kneejerk suspicion that they will alienate people and kill whatever cause they advocate. But experience suggests the exact opposite: just as successive waves of social reformers, the suffragettes and the anti-apartheid movement were stubborn, daring and creative enough to make their demands irresistible, so the people now lying in roads and charging into airports and refineries have conveyed the urgency of climate breakdown more successfully than anyone in a suit. There is a very good reason for that: it is only well outside centres of power that you can find the answer to a question that power and politics are dodging more than ever – how to live as if the truth is actually true.', 'John Harris is a Guardian columnist', 'Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But changing the way the public realm looks is not without controversy, with some complaining so-called weeds make urban spaces unsightly.', 'Heavily used in farming, glyphosate’s non-agricultural use extends to parks and green spaces, pavements and playgrounds, hospitals and shopping centres. Since the WHO declared it a “probable human carcinogen” in 2015, after research found “strong” evidence for its toxicity, 70 to 80 UK councils have turned to chemical-free options or simply letting plants grow, from Bath & North East Somerset council, to Highland council in Scotland.', 'Nick Mole, from Pesticide Action Network (PAN), which campaigns against glyphosate, said that in the past few years an increasing number of councils, “from parish up to county”, have implemented small-scale trials to wholesale bans.', '“More and more over the last couple of years we’ve been having councils come directly to us to say: ‘This is something we want to do; how can we do it?’,” said Mole.', 'Recent research revealed glyphosate seriously harms bee health, while another report claimed EU regulators dismissed evidence linking the herbicide to animal tumours.', '“I think there has been a growth in public interest and of course we’ve had the ever increasing news of the biodiversity crisis,” he said. “I think councils have seen that this is something their voters want – and this is councils across the whole entire political spectrum, as well – it’s a very non-party political issue.”', 'However, PAN admits some councils later roll back measures, concerned about the “neat and tidy brigade”.', 'Brighton and Hove went glyphosate-free in 2018 under the former Labour administration with unanimous cross-party support. However, local Conservative councillors have since begun appearing in local newspapers complaining about rewilding having gone too far.', 'Green Brighton and Hove councillor, Jamie Lloyd, says it’s not about leaving weeds everywhere, but selectively removing them. “It is true that huge weeds growing in the middle of pavements is undesirable,” he said. “So what we need to do is remove those weeds manually”', 'And Lloyd says comments he hears while weeding pavements himself indicate it’s “more popular than the sensationalist headlines suggest”.', '“I do agree that you don’t want pavements impassable for people with mobility issues.

We’ve lost so many insects in the last 20 years – I’ve read [about] declines of 60%. This is spectacular and extremely worrying – it’s the canary in the mine. We’ve got to throw everything we can at this, and the first thing we can do is stop poisoning them.”', 'Jon Burke was a Hackney councillor responsible for the east London borough beginning to phase out glyphosate in 2018, after children protested against its use outside the town hall. A borough-wide ban began in 2020.', 'Burke said: “The major threat presented by glyphosate is the fact that we’re eliminating plants from the public realm in the middle of a mass extinction event.', '“The majority of plants growing in the public realm are not weeds, but a mix of wildflowers and other things. Some of these plants are the only source of food for very specific species of insects. What I wanted to do was change the perception in Hackney, and potentially more broadly in the UK, of what a clean and tidy public realm is. We’ve grown up with this reaction that any kind of plant in the public realm makes it look scruffy and untidy – and yet we have a simultaneously high tolerance in the UK for McDonald’s wrappers in the gutters.”', 'Councils have tried different approaches when it comes to replacing glyphosate.

At 20 I came out of the Royal Air Force, where I had failed my trade test to become a photographer (I was never good at being tested – I’d even failed my 11-plus). I had a camera I’d bought in Nairobi and never properly used, until by chance I got some work at the Observer in 1959.', 'Two years later, the paper put me on a retainer for two days a week. I was earning very little money – 15 guineas a week – but gaining a great deal of knowledge about England. I was sent to every corner, to cover coalmining strikes, byelections, anti-fascist rallies, nuclear protests. I learned how to follow the action. You knew one event came after the other. Sooner or later someone would get a bit too troublesome. You kept your eyes open, looking for the next move: an arrest, a fight. It became a natural way of thinking and working and moving. I was very fast on my legs in those days – as quick as a greyhound.', 'I had this drive to follow world events very closely. Although I’m a poor reader and suffer from dyslexia, I took it upon myself – and still do – to buy the newspapers every day. I would scan every last word, looking for trouble at home and abroad. Then I would try to go there.', 'Over time I have come to see my photographs as a form of protest – in particular against the feast of evil that is war, because I have spent so much of my career documenting conflict. But that wasn’t always the case. Photography is very exciting. If you think you’ve got that picture – that you’ve made the composition and your exposure is right – that is a reward in itself. The most rewarding thing for me has always been to see my name under a picture in print.', 'But my work hasn’t been easy mentally. You never know what effect seeing pain and suffering can have on you – but you just hope your images will have an effect on the public and spur people to demonstrate against the terrible things in the world. I don’t take comfort in that because I wish the images didn’t have to be taken, that we didn’t need to be reminded of the occasional ugliness of man – and it is always men. Women don’t cause these wars.', 'My photograph of the man at Whitehall was for the Observer. I was sent to cover an anti-nuclear demonstration in Trafalgar Square during the Cuban missile crisis. The man had broken away from the crowd and made his way down Whitehall – the seat of power. The police threw a line out across the road very quickly, knowing other protesters would follow him.', 'Looking at the image now, I find it amusing. You see all these rather serious policemen, but one or two are slightly smirking. The man, who I never got to speak to, looks quite lonely sitting with his placard. In those days – here at least – there was still a civil approach to demonstration. Today the man might get his head cracked in or be sprayed with CS gas. Demonstrations around the world get violent: people are gassed and shot. The police are not particularly liked, and with good reason – think of the vigil for Sarah Everard in 2021 on Clapham Common and the way women were handcuffed and pressed to the ground. It’s shameful.', 'I do question whether seeing what’s going on helps or changes anything. But I still find it tragic that we don’t see as many images of these events in the media any more.

Hutchinson didn’t realise at the time that his act would be shared around the world. “I didn’t think of it at all. I’m a bit older than a lot of the people that were there, I’m not quite pulling my phone out and recording everything I see.” Afterwards, however, when the picture was published, he realised: “Oh yeah, it’s going to go everywhere.”', 'It was an odd experience, but not a bad one. “It felt really good,” Hutchinson says. “I was receiving messages from around the world, from thousands of people, saying that it gave them hope.” He even received messages from people involved with the far right, saying his actions had made them think about their own beliefs and “the people they hang around with”. He became a celebrity: an interview with GQ, a book deal and a meeting with Prince Harry all followed.', 'Today, Hutchinson runs his fitness and martial arts business, and does activism and community work with the organisation he founded with the friends who were with him that day, United to Change and Inspire. And he still likes the image. “I’m actually quite proud of it. When I’m long gone, my grandchildren will be able to point to it and say, ‘That’s my grandad.’” FB', 'In the 1990s, environmental protests swept Britain. Here, activists protest against the construction of the Newbury bypass in Berkshire – hundreds of acres of woodland were cleared for it. Activist Swampy, AKA Dan Hooper, became the face of the movement in early 1997 after police raided a protest camp in Devon. He was an object of fascination for the tabloids, who reported on everything from his love life to his possession of magic mushrooms and his relationship with his parents. “It made my life a little bit weird for a while,” he remembers, so much so that he took to refusing all interviews and vanished from the public eye. Now, however, he believes “we kind of need the media a little bit”. Back then, the whole country would follow the drama when Swampy was evicted from tunnels or trees, and environmental issues found a wider (if often hostile) audience as a result. “Now I look back on it and think, wow, if it made any difference, then it was worth it.” FB', '“The people we put on pedestals should be inspirational, people to literally and figuratively look up to,” Rhian Graham says. She is one of the four defendants who stood accused of criminal damage for their role in toppling a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol during an anti-racism protest on 7 June 2020.', 'This wasn’t the only statue to be targeted that summer. The murder of George Floyd had sparked a wave of anti-racist protests across the world and demonstrators frequently targeted monuments commemorating colonial figures. But this image had a particularly strong impact. As Graham recalls: “It was a moment of victory, of people saying: ‘Colston and men like him do not represent Bristol today and do not deserve to be on a pedestal.’”', 'The four were cleared of the charges by a jury earlier this year. Unused funds raised for the trial are being distributed to anti-racist charities in Bristol. “To have been found not guilty has given me faith in humanity again,” Graham says. But the attorney general has since made the contentious decision to refer the case to the court of appeal for legal clarification. The new policing bill has a section that raises the maximum penalty for damaging a statue to 10 years in prison – a move Graham says “illuminates our government’s priorities and who the laws are designed to protect”. GS', 'The Greenham Common Women’s Peace Camp, an anti-nuclear encampment that ran from 1981 to 2000, was the largest female-led protest movement since the suffragettes. The most famous event at the camp was Embrace the Base: a protest marking the first anniversary of Nato’s decision to store nuclear missiles at the RAF airfield in Berkshire. On 12 and 13 December 1982, more than 30,000 women came together to hold hands and encircle the nine-mile perimeter fence of Greenham.', '“It was a really powerful moment, because there were so many of us from all different walks of life,” recalls Angie Zelter, an environmental and human rights campaigner who attended Embrace the Base. The fact that they were all women was important, Zelter says, because it allowed them “a space to speak and act in their own way without being dominated by men, who tend to take the limelight in a mixed group. Women felt safe to engage in nonviolent direct action – they were able to cry freely, hold hands, show their vulnerability.”', 'There was a heavy police presence at Greenham Common, with frequent raids, evictions and arrests. At Embrace the Base, Zelter says, horses were brought in to try to disperse the women: “I was quite frightened. At one point I was crying, but there were other women there who were used to horses, trying to calm them down.” Today she continues to campaign against nuclear weapons: “Regardless of what the so-called law says about protest, we have a right to protest and we will continue to protest.” GS', 'Fulvio Grimaldi was one of the few journalists present when British soldiers opened fire on protesters in Derry, killing 13 people.

The eye-catching spectacle of the Red Rebel Brigade was devised by a Bristol-based arts group for a protest in April 2019. With their bright red outfits, symbolising the blood of all living species, the silent troupe made a memorable impression – and continues to make appearances in rallies in different cities. XR is sometimes criticised – by figures on both the left and right – for promoting the strategy of disruptive protest. “People like civil disobedience in the past – they don’t really like it in the present,” Farrell says. “But disruption is necessary because it’s a way of getting the message across with much more urgency. If you are living in a society that is self-consciously self-terminating, then disrupting that is an extremely compassionate thing to do.” GS', 'Seeking to “free art from oil”, Liberate Tate is a collective that stages unsanctioned performance-cum-protests in gallery spaces.

It was a very heavy feeling,” Patsy Stevenson says of the vigil on London’s Clapham Common on 13 March 2021. Hundreds had gathered to mourn Sarah Everard, who had been abducted, raped and murdered by Metropolitan police officer Wayne Couzens. “Often as women we’re told to stay indoors when things like this happen. It was one of those moments where it was like, no, we don’t want to stay silent any longer,” Stevenson says.', 'The Met claimed the gathering was in breach of Covid-19 restrictions and several participants were arrested. The image of Stevenson made an instant impact: “Probably because of my bright red hair,” she says. “But also the fact that I was at a vigil mourning the death of a woman by a police officer, and the police were arresting us.”', 'The high court has since found the police’s attempt to block the vigil was unlawful. Stevenson is undertaking individual legal action against the Met and is not allowed to discuss the case. While the events of her arrest were traumatising – “I’m in therapy now because of it” – Stevenson is grateful for the increased attention on combating violence against women. “It gave me some opportunities to change people’s opinions and hopefully get more things done.” GS', 'People in more than 600 cities across the world took to the streets on 15 February 2003 to express their opposition to the planned US-led invasion of Iraq.

Much of the protesters’ anger was towards British newspapers. “We wanted to shame the press,” Pilkington-Bernier says. “It felt like the only time the black community made the newspapers was crime.”', 'Writer and photographer Vron Ware was there in solidarity and also to bear witness, “both to the grief, rage and dignity of the assembly, but also to the police tactics”. Ware had covered many fascist demonstrations in the late 70s and for her the way far-right protesters were treated, “marching wherever they liked”, was in stark contrast to the heavy-handed approach of the Metropolitan police towards the black protesters. Earlier this year, Pilkington-Bernier recognised herself in the picture at an exhibition that she visited with her niece. “When we saw it, we were both so happy,” she says. “It’s so important these images are seen now – the next generation, with the Black Lives Matter movement, are walking in our footsteps.” FB', 'In the late 70s, Jayaben Desai (second from right) led a workers’ strike at the Grunwick Film Processing factory in Willesden, advocating for better working conditions.

From the noughties, I saw plans from trusts, health authorities and commissioning groups that reduced the numbers of hospital and psychiatric hospital beds, driven, in some cases, by workforce issues and a need to centralise specialist services but by a belief that acute services should be provided in the community.', 'Double running costs were never considered to ensure that community services were up and running before closing beds. This has led to the catastrophic situation for mental health patients and the unacceptable and dangerous bed occupancy rates in the acute hospital sector. This approach was largely due to the Department of Health.

I am pro life in my new pond, now swarming with tadpoles, most of which will be eaten by dragonfly larvae or newts. Life is also death.', 'The problem on planet Earth is that one particular life form is getting in the way. It’s humans. In 1800, there were fewer than a billion people on the planet. The discovery of coal, then oil and gas has provided immense benefits over the last 200 years. But it’s also enabled a current population of eight billion, resulting in the other life on the planet being crowded out as we have destroyed and polluted natural habitats. We are living in the sixth great extinction.', 'Pro life means there should be fewer people, not more. Sex education, family planning and access to abortion as a fundamental right should be at the heart of this vision of pro life.Antony Turner\n Teignmouth, Devon', 'I read with interest your article on the high fuel costs of the fishing industry in Brixham (“If fuel goes up, we can’t afford to fish – trawler skippers”, News). In 2008/9, Greenpeace said the high oil price had done more to curtail damaging industrial fishing than it had achieved in 30 years.', 'The industrial trawlers mentioned by Barry Young, managing director of Brixham Trawler Agents, are least worthy of fuel subsidies: why should taxpayers subsidise such fuel-intensive and environmentally damaging fisheries? The fuel per kilo of fish caught consumed by these industrial fleets is up to 10 times greater than fuel used by inshore fleets. Furthermore, the industrial trawlers are fishing closer inshore, jeopardising the fisheries of many of the small-scale inshore fishers, whose livelihoods depend on them, and who have a far greater economic multiplier effect in the local economy. If fisheries were better managed, there would be plenty of fish in the sea. Sadly, it’s the greed of the massively wealthy few in Brixham who continue to peddle their tales of woe.Caroline Bennett\n Plymouth', 'I share Rachel Cooke’s sadness that the OCR exam board is removing work by poets such as Thomas Hardy, John Keats, Philip Larkin and Wilfred Owen from its GCSE English literature syllabus, though not entirely for the same reason (Notebook.

And Bernie Eccleston says he would “take a bullet” for Putin, that the war in Ukraine is “unintentional” and that Hamilton could have “brushed aside” Piquet’s remarks. Sport, eh?', 'After a deeply dismaying few days, then, it was nice to return to drama of a more pantomime variety yesterday at Silverstone, where the presence of Max Verstappen – arch-nemesis of local hero Hamilton – was met by a hearty chorus of jeers from a hostile crowd who are yet to forget Abu Dhabi. This sort of juvenile nonsense, I think we can all agree, is very much the upside of big sport.', 'Not that our Max saw it that way. “If they want to boo they do that, they all have their own opinions, I don’t care,” he huffed, not entirely convincingly, perhaps after being told by a minion that the crowd were actually shouting “Red Booooo-ull”.', 'But Verstappen had other reasons to sulk, not least the fact that pole position had been snatched from his grasp by the brilliant Carlos Sainz during a thrilling last lap in the Northamptonshire drizzle, doing the business by a tight 0.072secs. The Spaniard pushed Verstappen to the limit in Montreal last week and his place in the front row today represents another tricky hurdle for the title favourite, who currently sits a tidy 46 points clear in the drivers’ standings.', 'If that sounds like fair old distance, well, it is exactly how far ahead of Verstappen Charles Leclerc was after the season’s first three races. The Monégasque – now behind both Verstappen and Perez in the standings – will be desperate to reassert his title credentials today after enduring a hiding to nothing last week, when he finished fifth after starting from the back due to grid penalties.', 'As for the local golden boy, things are finally picking up after a testing start to the season. Hamilton was fighting for the front row throughout much of yesterday’s qualifying, with Mercedes’ recent upgrades seeming to have helped. “Oh man, I was having so much fun out there,” he beamed afterwards. Perhaps only the very most optimistic fans could hope for a Hamilton victory today – but a podium finish would certainly go down a treat at Silverstone.

Australian actors have taken on roles such as Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), the Joker (Heath Ledger), Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth). A score of blockbusters (including the new Thor: Love and Thunder) have been filmed on our shores; however, George Miller’s planned Justice League film got curtailed in 2008 when the government ruled that the project wasn’t Australian enough to earn tax rebates. While superhero cinema might often feature Australian faces or locations, Australia itself has rarely been represented on screen.', 'The most prominent role Australia as a nation has played in a superhero flick would still be in 1980’s Superman II, where Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) sets ownership of Australia as his price for selling out Earth to the Kryptonian tyrant General Zod. It would take 25 films for Australia to officially make an appearance in the sprawling Marvel Cinematic Universe, as Angelina Jolie’s secluded hideout in Eternals. The one possible predecessor to this would be the delightful (but non-canonical) Team Thor shorts, in which Thor takes a working holiday in Australia and flatshares with a put-upon IT professional called Darryl.', 'However, if we shift our attention to comics, it becomes a different story. Despite the action in the Marvel and DC Universes both being primarily US-based, there is a surprisingly long history of Australia appearing as the site of superheroic conflicts, terraformed, blown up and rebuilt. In my purely subjective opinion, here are the 10 greatest events to happen to Australia in Earth 616 (Marvel) and Earth-1 (DC).', 'Joe Simon and Jack Kirby’s Captain America famously debuted in 1941 by socking Hitler on the jaw. For Simon and Kirby, two working-class Jews in New York, their patriotic hero could serve as agitprop to encourage a reluctant US to take action against Nazi Germany.', 'For the vast majority of his publishing history, Cap is situated within the European Theatre of the second world war. A rare exception to this is 1944’s Captain America Comics #36, which opens with the tale The Blood of Dr Necrosis. It is the earliest example I can find of Australia being depicted in what would later become the Marvel Universe.', 'The story opens with Captain America and Bucky fighting side by side with an Australian battalion, when they get reports of mysterious cases of gangrene among wounded Australian soldiers. They fly to Brisbane to investigate and discover that the grotesque Dr Necrosis, who runs the blood bank, has been tainting the plasma supply. Of course our heroes defeat the Nazi spy, but you have to wonder how the Queensland Health Department’s background checks didn’t suspect there might be an issue giving a critical public service job to a guy named Dr Necrosis. (Maybe he was a National Party donor.)', 'It is harder to establish the first on-panel depiction of Australia in the DC Universe. My favourite of these earliest examples has to be The Beast from the Stars, from 1958’s The Adventures of Rex The Wonder Dog #39, written by John Broome and illustrated by Gil Kane.', 'Rex, a White Shepherd, accompanies journalist Paul Henley on an assignment to Australia to investigate a strange bug-eyed monster that was caught in the bush. Rex serves as Henley’s official photographer, with a camera hanging off his collar; he also happens to be the only being who can understand the alien astronaut Xtar’s instructions on how to capture the monster. Rex finds a convenient apple tree and sets up a trail to lead the beast straight into Xtar’s spaceship. Once he returns to the US, Rex is rewarded with pats and being told that he’s the smartest dog in the universe.', 'Power Rangers is a superhero franchise that has deep Australian connections, despite being a hybrid of the US and Japanese kids TV markets: 1995’s Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie is basically the genesis of Sydney’s modern status as a global film-making hub, while the 2017 reboot was directed by Curtin University graduate Dean Israelite and stars Aussie Stranger Things star Dacre Montgomery.', 'Melbourne-based writer Tom Taylor scripted the first ever crossover between the Power Rangers and the DC Universe. Working with artist Stephen Byrne on 2017’s Justice League/Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the pair united the two superteams and their respective villains Brainiac and Lord Zedd. The evil duo send out giant octopus monsters to major cities across the globe to divide and conquer the superheroes. One such monster finds its way to Victoria, where it starts the rampage at Flinders Street Station. Thankfully for Melburnian commuters, Batman and the Black Ranger arrive in the Mastodon Zord to save the day.', 'Manifold, AKA Eden Fesi, has become the most prominent Australian hero in the modern Marvel Universe. An Aboriginal man from the Northern Territory, he was trained in his teleportation powers by X-Men ally Gateway and was recruited by Nick Fury to be part of his covert team working to regain control of the spy agency Shield from the fascist terror group Hydra. When writer Jonathan Hickman took over the Avengers franchise in 2012, Manifold was reintroduced as a key member of the team. He has also been a close ally of Black Panther, helping T’Challa stop a civil war in Wakanda.', 'When The Babadook director Jennifer Kent was asked if she wanted to make a Marvel movie, she highlighted Manifold as the character she was most interested in exploring. Kent also nominated the star of her film The Nightingale, Baykali Ganambarr, as her choice to play the hero.', 'In 1955, a team of international heroes inspired by Batman was formed, known as The Batmen of All Nations. This included Ranger, an Australian hero who adopted Ned Kelly iconography. In a creepy 2007 mystery written by Grant Morrison and illustrated by the brilliant JH Williams III, the Batmen of All Nations are reunited to investigate the murder of their original benefactor. The Dark Ranger falls victim to the murderer as well, leaving his sidekick Scout to become Australia’s next Batman equivalent. In z #6, Scout – AKA Johnny Ridley, an Aboriginal tattoo artist from Melbourne – is formally inducted by The Dark Knight into his new team in a quasi-religious ceremony that sees him swear the same oath Batman and Robin made to fight against crime.', 'Jonathan Hickman’s run on The Avengers starts with biological bombs being fired at Earth from Mars. Each transforms the site they hit, terraforming the location by forcing billions of years of evolution to occur instantly. It was a profoundly weird experience to open up the latest adventure of Marvel’s top superhero team to find out that my home town had essentially been destroyed.', 'About 10 issues later, The Avengers return to a bug-infested Perth. It was a truly uncanny feeling to see familiar Perth streets like St Georges Terrace overtaken with weird vines.', 'The 2019 Suicide Squad series opens with a new fleet of nuclear submarines being proudly unveiled in Fremantle Harbour. The show is disrupted by The Revolutionaries, a team that could be described as Extinction Rebellion with superpowers. Bizarrely, writer Tom Taylor prophesised the Aukus deal that would be announced two years later by having The Revolutionaries hijack a nuclear submarine sold to Australia by the US.', 'Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning', 'This series (which is available as a graphic novel called Suicide Squad: Bad Blood), also saw Taylor and artist Bruno Redondo introduce Thylacine, a new Aboriginal anti-heroine for the DC Universe. They consulted with Aboriginal actor Shari Sebbens and Cleverman creator Ryan Griffen in developing the character.', 'In the later stages of Chris Claremont’s 17-year run writing the X-Men, he had the mutants leave the leafy grounds of Xavier’s Institute for Gifted Youngsters for the remote outback town of Cooterman’s Creek. The base debuted in Claremont and artist Marc Silvestri’s Uncanny X-Men #229, as the mutant heroes fought off cybernetic mercenaries who were occupying the town. The X-Men would be based in Cooterman’s Creek for around a year, during which they meet the aforementioned Gateway, who became their main means of transport from the NT to the rest of the world.', 'Invasion! was a big crossover event for DC Comics, published in 1989. Here, the alien race known as the Dominators put together an alliance of alien civilisations all fearful that Earth’s superheroes will displace their power in the galaxy. They choose Australia to be their beachhead for the invasion, believing that the island continent has no superheroes to defend it.', 'It is striking to see the future Spawn creator and Image Comics founder Todd McFarlane draw the destruction of Melbourne, which becomes the Alien Alliance’s base of operations on Earth. All of Australia is quickly subjugated, becoming the example the Dominators use to try to blackmail the rest of the planet into giving up their superheroes.', 'What could possibly be a bigger event than all of Australia being invaded by aliens? Only the (former) Lord of Hell deciding to make Australia his first stop after throwing away his crown. In my favourite story from Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman (and yes, I can already hear people complaining that Sandman isn’t a superhero comic – except that the Justice League actually appear on panel in the first arc), the series’ moody hero, Dream of the Endless, journeys into hell to free his lost love who has been unjustly imprisoned there for millennia. Expecting to have to face Lucifer in combat, Dream is instead given the keys by Lucifer, who is sick of having to rule over the damned. Throughout Seasons of Mists, Dream has to negotiate with delegations of demons, gods and angels, all trying to secure prime psychic real estate in hell.', 'In the story’s epilogue drawn by Mike Dringenberg, Lucifer (depicted as David Bowie), has buggered off to a beach in Perth. After a brief chat with an old bloke on the unfairness of life and how it contrasts with the physical beauty of the world, even Lucifer himself gives props to God, telling him “The sunsets are bloody marvellous, you old bastard.”', 'Kevin Chiat is a writer and academic from Perth.

One from the over.', '32nd over: India 109-5 (Pant 18, Jadeja 6) Jadeja edges Broad towards first slip, where Root grabs the ball near the ground and immediately signals that he doesn’t know whether it has carried. The soft signal is not out, so you’d expect Jadeja to be fine.', 'The replays aren’t conclusive. Even if Root did get his fingers under the ball, there’s no way it could have been overturned by the third umpire.', '“What about Patrick Patterson?” says Ewan Glenton. “93 Test wickets at a phenomenal(?) strike rate of 51.9, the fastest of them all according to the supremely qualified Jeff Dujon. Fearsome, unplayable spells against some of the best & toughest bats in the business… but only 26 Tests.”', 'Yes, he was the one bowler who made Graham Gooch fear for his safety, at Sabina Park in 1986. I had a lot of fun researching that game a few years ago, though the story of what happened to Patterson is pretty sad.', '31st over: India 107-5 (Pant 17, Jadeja 5) Ah, turns out Leach only came on so that Anderson could change ends. Jadeja defends a couple of dangerous inswingers and ignores the rest. A maiden.', '“As the oft-omitted XI would need an all-rounder,” begins Geoff Wignall, “Brian Close comes first to mind: 22 Tests spread over 27 years.”', 'Twenty-seven was also the number of bruises he had on his chest after that appointment with Michael Holding and Andy Roberts in 1976.', '30th over: India 107-5 (Pant 17, Jadeja 5) A double change, with Broad on for Anderson. Pant, again on the charge, inside edges to square leg for a single, and then Jadeja survives a hopeful LBW appeal. Too high.', '“Most unjustly omitted at Test level?” says Sean Clayton. “A keeper, bowler and batter respectively: Chris Read, Neil Mallender and Owais Shah. The latter seemed to be ‘definitely next man up except...’ for about a decade...”', 'I thought Owais Shah was unlucky not to play more one-day cricket, certainly in the early 2000s. Mallender was damned if he did well (which he did), because they were going to India the following winter. The braver call, I think, would have been to drop Mallender for the Oval Test against Pakistan, though I understand why that didn’t happen.', '29th over: India 105-5 (Pant 16, Jadeja 4) A fascinating bit of captaincy from Ben Stokes, who has decided to bring on Jack Leach, against Rishabh Pant, with mid-on and mid-off up. In fact the first big shot comes from Ravindra Jadeja, who gets off the mark by charging Leach and lifting him over mid-on for four.', '28th over: India 98-5 (Pant 13, Jadeja 0) James Anderson: 12-2-31-3.', 'Sam Billings takes a superb catch to get rid of Shreyas Iyer! He gloved an awkward delivery from Anderson down the leg side, where Billings flew to his left to grab the ball one-handed. Iyer goes for a frisky 11-ball 15, and England are into the allrounders.', '26th over: India 86-4 (Pant 5, Iyer 11) No fireworks in this over from Anderson, but a flurry of singles, which may irritate him just as much.', '“Bazball vs Rishabh Pant,” says Robert on Twitter. “The irresistible force meets the irresistible force.”', 'And that’s me done. Thanks for your company, correspondence and scandalous omissions. I leave you in the superb hands of Rob Smyth, back from a month off.', '25th over: India 81-4 (Pant 2, Iyer 10) Here is Iyer, starting as confidently as you’d expect of a young star with a Test average of 55. He pushes Potts for two, square-drives for four, then alas-drives for four more. He’s overtaken Pant already! There may be hell to pay for that. But what a great moment for Potts, who has now bagged Kohli as well as Kane Williamson in his first international summer.', '“Having the keeper bat earlier,” says John Starbuck, “is a sensible option, given that you wouldn’t want him to be tired out before starting the second innings. Vice versa if you’re bowling first, naturally. Surprising that more teams don’t do this as a matter of course.”', 'The big one! Kohli tries to leave this ball from Potts, but he leaves the decision too late and is out played on, just as he nearly was first ball after lunch. You know when you’ve been Pottsed.', '24th over: India 71-3 (Kohli 11, Pant 2) After three balls, Pant decides he has played himself in and charges down the track at Anderson. The upshot is only an inside edge for a single. Anderson answers back with actions rather than words, beating Pant with the fifth ball of the over, and the last.', '“I’m following the OBO at work,” says Simon Dobey, “desperate summer. My most omitted great is Eoin Morgan, patience and leadership to spare. Both implacable virtues in a top class Test cricketer. A shame it never worked out for him in red ball.”', '“Re: whether we can let in players who have played 62 Tests,” adds Will Denton, “didn’t this conversation start with regards to Ashwin, who has played… 86 Tests?” Bang to rights.', '23rd over: India 69-3 (Kohli 10, Pant 1) This is a bold move from Bumrah: sending Rishabh Pant in at No 5, rather than Shreyas Iyer. That’s the sort of thing Ben Stokes might do. Pant gets off the mark with a sober single to square leg, and Kohli leg-glances for four. But the wicket was the main thing and Potts, as usual, thoroughly deserved it. He’s like Ollie Robinson without any of the drawbacks.', 'And here’s Ben in Whitstable. “My Test career,” he reckons, “also spanned the years that Oasis were any good.” Oof.', 'Another one! Potts bowls the nip-backer, it keeps low, and even Potts can risk a celebrappeal. Vihari thinks about reviewing but Kohli talks him out of it, and rightly so. That is a very plumb plumb.', '22nd over: India 62-2 (Vihari 18, Kohli 6) Anderson continues, but his duel with Kohli only occupies one ball of this over as Kohli, twitching visibly, converts his nervous energy into a dab into the covers for a single. Vihari, gradually getting more comfortable, plays a glide for three.', '“Test careers spanning the entire time that Oasis were good?” says Gavin Hutchinson with a snort. “A harsher person than I might cite Joey Benjamin.” Ha. Benjamin, as you know, played one Test in 1994.', '21st over: India 57-2 (Vihari 14, Kohli 5) Play resumes, and so does Matthew Potts. He bowls to Kohli – and almost nabs him, played on! Kohl’s bat was crooked and the ball squirted past the leg stump for a streaky four.', '“One of my fave stats,” says Stuart Silvers, who started this thread. “The gap between Bicknell’s second and third Test caps spanned the whole of Darren Gough’s Test career.” Ha, yes, spot-on – a whole decade from 1993 to 2003. So it also spanned all the years when Oasis were any good, with some to spare.', '“Most omitted great,” says Ben Mimmack. “Matt Le Tissier – did I do this right?”', '“To all those who say that the English have no sense of humour,” chuckles V Kishnamoorthy, “they invented a game that needs five continuous days of sunshine.” You mean you’re not a fan of heavy cloud cover?', '“Most omitted greats,” says Stuart Silvers, briskly. “Angus Fraser, Robin Smith, Ben Foakes, Stuart Law, Darren Lehmann, Shoaib Mohammad, Vinod Kambli, Harold Larwood. And top of the list by miles, Sydney Barnes.” Intriguing line-up! I know what you mean about The Judge, but are we really going to let in players who got 62 Tests?', 'The rain has stopped and, all being well, play will resume at 2.15pm, in just over a quarter of an hour. Tea will be at 4.15 and there will be an extended last session with the close at 7pm.', '“Good to see that India are paying their own tribute to Bob Willis,” says Jezz Nash, “by having a fast bowling number 11 as captain for this Test.” Ha. “Hope the weather improves for Blue for Bob, tomorrow.”', '“I’m watching this,” says William Milner, “at a sports bar in sunny Rhodes in the heat and loving every minute. Chardonnay in the bucket. \n  “I played for Warwickshire boys with Neil Smith (son of MJK) back in the 80s and remember Bob Willis jogging round the colts’ ground even back then. We were 13 and he was big with even bigger hair.” Nice.\n  “I recently saw a post highlighting how I could listen in to TMS overseas. Could you please repost?” OK, as it’s raining.\n  “Btw is Kumar [Sangakkara] possibly the greatest ‘cricket man’ of our times? Please get him on our coaching staff somehow… or better still head of MCC.” Yes, one of the great cricket people – but he has already been MCC president.', 'Sanga was the first in a chain of mildly revolutionary appointments. He handed the baton to Clare Connor, the first woman to do the job in 233 years. And she in turn has appointed Stephen Fry, probably the first MCC president who is openly gay, and definitely the first to be openly supporting Extinction Rebellion. If only Jim Swanton were here to see it.', 'Sure enough, that inspection was on the optimistic side. There will be another one at 1.45, so the earliest the players will get back out there is 2.', '“Thanks for the coverage,” says Tom Wein. “With Ashwin in the yellow vest again, can we build a team of most-omitted greats? Alongside Ashwin, perhaps Bob Taylor and Stuart MacGill? Who else would OBOers pick?”', 'Great question. To go with that nicely balanced spin attack, here’s a seamer for you: Martin Bicknell.', 'It’s still raining, so Jimmy Anderson can have some cheese and crackers. The rain may be easing off: if so, there will be an inspection in ten minutes’ time, but that looks a touch optimistic', 'It never stops, does it? After those T20s, there are three ODIs, also against India (12-17 July). Brook is in this squad too, but he may not get a game as there are recalls for two more senior Yorkies: Jonny Bairstow, presumably resuming his opening partnership with Jason Roy, and Joe Root, displacing Dawid Malan as the designated driver of the party bus. And who’s this sneaking in as the allrounder? It’s Ben Stokes! Gleeson drops out, Carse continues and Overton (C) comes back, so there are two specialist right-arm seamers and just the three lefties.', 'Full squad Jason Roy, Jonny Bairstow, Phil Salt, Joe Root, Jos Buttler (capt, wkt), Harry Brook, Liam Livingstone, Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali, Sam Curran, David Willey, Craig Overton, Bryson Carse, Reece Topley, Matt Parkinson.', 'Jos Buttler, exuding calm as usual, is giving an interview in his capacity as England’s new white-ball captain. Asked what he feels about the Test team doing so well, he says “I’m enjoying watching as a fan... To be honest, I wasn’t worth my place in the side.”', 'His first squad has just been announced, as this Test is to be followed by three T20s against India on 7-10 July. Harry Brook, who’s been batting like Bradman for Yorkshire, gets the call, and so does Richard Gleeson, the Northants seamer, who takes the Brydon Carse role as the token right-armer. With Adil Rashid taking a break for the Hajj, Matt Parkinson gets a good opportunity.', 'Full squad Jason Roy, Phil Salt, Dawid Malan, Jos Buttler (capt, wkt), Harry Brook, Liam Livingstone, Moeen Ali, Sam Curran, David Willey, Chris Jordan, Tymal Mills, Richard Gleeson, Reece Topley, Matt Parkinson.', 'Atherton was spot-on, lunch is being taken. England had slightly the better of the morning as Anderson (8-2-15-2) produced two moments of magic, but it could have been even better for them if Zak Crawley had taken all three of his chances. Do join us in half an hour.', 'One thing in the meantime. This Test is another fund-raiser for the Bob Willis Fund, which supports the fight against prostate cancer. It also celebrates a man who was a great cricket character twice over, first as a wild-eyed, shock-haired fast bowler, then as a grumpy old pundit. Edgbaston will be going Blue For Bob on Saturday.

Global capitalism is an incredible machine for extracting fossil fuels from our planet, refining them, shipping them to every corner of the Earth and making staggering amounts of money doing so. The humming of this machine, the fuel and the money that it spits out, has powered a century of unprecedented production and consumption by the Earth’s first-world nations. Unfortunately the machine is also poisoning us all. But one of its exquisitely evolved functions is to make it almost impossible to turn it off.', 'Oil and gas profits in the most recent quarter were astounding. Exxon Mobil made $18bn in profits in the past three months. Shell and Chevron each made nearly $12bn. Those are all record numbers. More major companies will announce their figures this week, and they are all expected to be bountiful. The war in Ukraine, which has devastated a region of the world and displaced millions, has helped energy companies by driving oil and gas prices higher. In this, we see another key characteristic of the machine: the fortunes of nations may rise and fall, but the oil companies will always survive and thrive, floating above the chaos of the world like passengers on a private jet, shaking their heads performatively at all the problems below.', 'The price of oil fluctuates, but that short-term volatility masks the industry’s long-term certainty of success. A recent study showed that for the past 50 years, the oil industry has made profits of more than $1tn a year, close to $3bn a day. These profits are driven not by some fantasy of free enterprise and perfect competition, but by the exact opposite – cartels, mega-corporations and the regulatory capture of governments, conspiring to create a market free of both competition and of a price that reflects the actual cost to the world of the product that is being sold.', 'Fossil fuels make enough money to corrupt politicians, cause wars and bend public opinion through the brute force of a firehose of propaganda. The machine does not just extract and sell fossil fuels; it also concerns itself with ensuring that the entire world is arranged in a way conducive to maintaining the demand for those fossil fuels. The growth of oil profits even as the reality of climate change is burning before our eyes is proof that no single crisis, no matter how existential, will be enough to shut this machine down naturally. The machine must either be broken by us, or it will break us all.', 'Capitalism is not designed to look several generations down the road. It is not designed to sacrifice for the greater good. It is designed to maximize profits. To pump every last barrel of oil on Earth, sell it, take the money and build a luxurious space ship to leave the planet that has been destroyed by burning all of that gas is a perfectly rational course of action according to the logic of capitalism. As long as there is a trillion dollars a year to be made, the fossil fuel industry will take the money. It is enough money to build a nice villa far, far away from the wars and droughts and floods and wildfires that fossil fuels are causing.', 'These profits are illusory. They are plagued by an externality large enough to outweigh a trillion dollars a year – the costs that the climate crisis will impose on billions of people who are alive now and many generations to come. The fact that capitalism is unable to properly price a barrel of oil to account for all the pain it will cause to your grandchildren whose home is wiped out by rising seas is proof that the whole idea of an impartial system of costs and rewards for labor and risks is a big sham.', 'The fossil fuel industry as a whole is not just another business, providing a service to meet a demand; it is a predatory drug dealer that works every day to keep the world addicted to its poisonous product, knowing full well that it will eventually prove fatal. It fights to keep the population fooled about its costs, to keep the political power structure incapable of keeping the public safe from its damages, and to keep the flow of supply coming at full blast despite any human or environmental toll. It is not something to be applauded. It is a problem to be solved.', 'It’s no big mystery how to change this toxic dynamic. Merely putting a price on fossil fuel that accurately reflects its costs – for example, through a carbon tax – would do the trick, with time, as it rapidly became economically unfeasible to mortgage the health of the planet’s future on a carbon credit card. Better, and faster, would be straightforward regulations paired with enormous public investments to transition to cleaner energy sources, a la the Green New Deal. The barrier here is not ideas, but rather politics, backstopped with a wall of money. So long as America fails to regulate the influence of money in politics, we will by extension fail to adequately regulate fossil fuels.', 'It is folly to assume that a system that has been constructed in part by the corporate power of the energy industry will find a way to rein in that same industry against its wishes. It’s willfully stupid to imagine that electoral politics will be up to this task. This is an issue that is, more than most, begging for radicalism. It will take more than installing a solar panel on your roof. For older people with means, it will take agitating within each and every institution you are a part of to divest from the fossil fuel industry; for younger people with passion, it will take agitating in the streets. For all of us, it will take treating the tremendous but slow-moving threat of climate change with the deadly seriousness it deserves.', 'So next time you see young people sitting in at a senator’s office or blocking the streets or hollering at Joe Manchin’s yacht, don’t mock them.

The new bill provides the certainty of a 10-year tax credit program and allows the credits to be transferrable to the developers themselves. There is also billions of dollars for the domestic manufacturing of clean energy components, as well as rebates for people to buy electric cars.', 'The White House has said the legislation will save the country as much as $1.9tn in climate-related costs by the mid-point of the century, through reduced deaths and property damage caused by extreme heat, floods, drought and wildfires.

There are a lot of big assumptions, but taken together these analyses all show this bill is a big deal and I agree with that,” said James Stock, an economist at Harvard University.', '“We need to make sure these projects are built – if we go into traditional American project gridlock, that will be a problem.

A particular sore point is the “Delta” – a pay deduction agreed by pilots during Covid to minimise planned redundancies. Given the rebound and the labour market now, keeping on the pilots looks a good business decision – but Balpa members are still losing 4-10% of their wages for saving the airline from itself. “It’s galling,” says Chalk.', 'Covid, he says, was a useful context “to drive through changes that would have been more difficult under normal circumstances. I wonder how many of their challenges now are down to how they treated staff in the pandemic. No other airline suggested firing and rehiring all their staff. BA did.”', 'He remains pleased with a deal Balpa struck with easyJet to head off redundancies, but does not buy the idea that Ryanair is reaping the rewards of treating staff better during the pandemic. “They are certainly mellowing – but their business model [is] leant to shrinking and growing.” The airline already relied more on agency workers and contracts than its competitors. Chalk describes Michael O’Leary’s return to full pay this year as chief executive while pilots were asked to keep taking Covid-enforced cuts as “morally bankrupt”.', 'Across aviation, 2022 has brought a tumultuous return to mass flying, with labour shortages leading to widespread queues, delays and flight cancellations.

In the Canadian province of British Columbia, cattle have been used to clear areas at risk of wildfires.', 'Parts of Spain adopted the strategy nearly two decades ago, when the southern region of Andalusia began paying shepherds to traverse its overgrown plains and valleys with their animals. The regional programme has since swelled to include more than 100,000 animals, saving officials an estimated 75% of the cost of having the land mechanically cleared.', 'The grazing has brought about other benefits: the animals carry seeds and fertilise as they move through the terrain and their relatively indiscriminate feeding habits nurture biodiversity by curtailing the competitive advantage of some plants.', 'Research has suggested targeted grazing can be effective when paired with other wildfire prevention methods such as mechanical clearing and controlled burning, said Julia Rouet-Leduc, a researcher at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research at the University of Leipzig.', '“It’s not a miracle solution,” she added. “But it is part of a solution that can help landscapes be more resilient to fire.”', 'Sign up to First Edition', 'Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters', 'after newsletter promotion', 'Its success lies in tackling the perfect storm created by climate change-induced drought and decades of rural exodus. “There’s a lot of this shrubby, woody vegetation that grows on former pastures or agricultural land that is creating a lot of fuel for wildfires,” she said. “And that leads to wildfires that are bigger and harder to control when they happen.”', 'In Barcelona, where the pilot project wrapped up last month, plans are now under way to expand it to as many as three flocks and potentially more of the city’s green spaces.', 'The animals ended up tending 72 hectares of the park, said Badia.
