But how else will we wake up to the climate emergency?\\nFew people today would claim not to sympathise with the suffragettes \u2013 but this wasn\u2019t true at the time. When parliament debated women\u2019s struggle for the vote in 1914, Lord Robert Cecil \u2013 later a recipient of the Nobel peace prize, who was in fact supportive of women\u2019s suffrage \u2013 declared that \u201csuffragist outrages\u201d were a \u201cvery serious evil\u201d with the aim of \u201canarchy\u201d. There was only one solution \u201cto prevent them from committing crimes\u201d, he said: \u201cdeportation\u201d. When Reginald McKenna, then home secretary in HH Asquith\u2019s Liberal government, offered four options to deal with them \u2013 letting them die (\u201cThat is, I should say, at the present moment the most popular, judging by the number of letters I have received\u201d); deportation; treating them as \u201clunatics\u201d; or giving them the franchise \u2013 his fellow parliamentarians laughed uproariously at each.\\nThe suffragettes, it should be said, did not sit around singing kumbaya, and were far more militant than contemporary protest movements in Britain. They committed arson, including the burning of several private homes \u2013 with five resulting deaths \u2013and smashed up art galleries and museums. They attempted to destroy Glasgow\u2019s aqueduct and attacked churches. Targets for bombing included the extremely busy street outside the Bank of England, although the device was defused, while a train driver was nearly killed by another bomb. Damned at the time as terrorists and anarchists, the militants are today seen sympathetically by history. As the cheerful \u201csoldiers in petticoats\u201d in Disney\u2019s Mary Poppins predicted: \u201cOur daughters\u2019 daughters will adore us, and they\u2019ll sing in grateful chorus: \u2018Well done, Sister Suffragette!\u201d\\nWhy? Because the consensus is that the evil the suffragettes fought \u2013 the suppression of women\u2019s basic democratic rights \u2013 was greater than any evil the suffragettes themselves were responsible for.\\nEyes often roll when any movement is compared to the suffragettes, but the injustice that Insulate Britain confronts \u2013 the existential threat posed to humanity by the climate emergency \u2013 surely belongs in the same pantheon of struggles. Given the scientific consensus is that we face devastating consequences unless more radical action is taken, almost everyone respects the group\u2019s cause, quite unlike the suffragettes at the time: it is their tactics that are contested.\\nAs someone with a socialist perspective, there is much to sympathise with in the objections. Protest is supposed to target those with wealth and power: in the case of the climate emergency, that would mean focusing on the 100 companies responsible for 71% of global emissions, and the failures of the ruling Conservatives, who have received \u00a31.3m from fossil fuel interests and climate sceptics since 2019. Insulate Britain target motorways which, statistically speaking, are largely used by ordinary citizens, including working-class people travelling to underpaid and undervalued jobs. A \u201cjust transition\u201d is supposed to promote the idea that placing the global economy on a sustainable footing must not be achieved on the backs of poor people. Is glueing one\u2019s face to motorways rather than the doors of Shell\u2019s headquarters consistent with this demand?\\nAll movements are told that they are protesting the wrong way by detractors who often pretend to be sympathetic to their aims. The suffragettes were victims of this narrative, as was the civil rights movement in the US \u2013 Martin Luther King was denounced for inciting \u201chatred and violence\u201d. Gay rights and feminism were similarly denounced for their supposed counterproductive aggression and militancy. If only they could be more polite, less disruptive, less in your face then maybe people would listen!\\nUnfortunately strategies which, by definition, are more easily ignored are, well, ignored. When Extinction Rebellion protesters stormed the UK\u2019s largest oil refinery last week, the presence of two national Olympians did not win them as much media attention as the motorway blockers. If, therefore, you believe that millions of lives are imperilled and we are running out of time to do something about it, which modern science treats as an indisputable fact, is it not rational to settle on the tactic that raises the most attention? How will a human race facing severe consequences of the climate crisis in 30 years, which are far more disruptive than today\u2019s temporarily blocked motorways, look back at protesters doing something, anything, to raise the alarm?\\nIndeed, it is striking that Extinction Rebellion was unpopular, according to the polling back in their 2019 heyday. But surveys also revealed something else: that public concern about the environment surged to record levels after they began protesting. The very presence of \u2013 yes, inherently annoying \u2013 protests forced a conversation about an otherwise neglected issue, making people care more about it.\\nPublic anger is also easily misdirected. Fury in recent weeks has been focused on ambulances delayed by protesters, though no one has been reported dead because of Insulate Britain. Yet where was the comparable outrage about a patient who died in an ambulance outside Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge because it was too busy to cope? It is far easier to excite anger against the bogeyman of the disruptive activist than focus on the years of underfunding the health service, and a pandemic mishandled by Britain\u2019s government.\\nIf politicians were taking sufficient action to stave off climate calamity, and the media were more effective at building pressure on those in positions of power to act, then citizens would not be risking lengthy prison sentences by shutting down public infrastructure. That\u2019s where the frustration should really lie. Our house is burning: should ire be focused on those pouring on the petrol, or on the tactics of those yelling \u201cfire\u201d? So yes, just like the suffragettes with their far more extreme tactics, Insulate Britain is profoundly unpopular \u2013 and yet everyone today pretends that they would have been on the side of the window-smashing soldiers in petticoats.\\nOwen Jones is a Guardian columnist", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc0ee77f054163d07aaee2a53bf9900bf7581184/0_146_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Protesters from Insulate Britain blocking Great Charles Street Queensway in Birmingham."]], "author": ["Owen Jones"], "date": "2021-11-03"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/03/cop26-protesters-anger-and-frustration-tinged-with-optimism": {"title": "Cop26 protesters\u2019 anger and frustration tinged with optimism", "subtitle": null, "text": "While demonstrations have so far been small, there is a feeling among activists that momentum is building\\nOn Tuesday morning, activists dressed in the red jumpsuits familiar to viewers of the dystopian Netflix series Squid Game strike posed for the assembled media on the south bank of the Clyde, directly opposite the Cop26 conference centre.Across the river and further into the city centre later on Tuesday, Anne Thoday was squatting on the pavement on St Vincent Street next to her surdo drum as a thick line of police prevented Extinction Rebellion protesters from moving towards the conference centre.\\n\u201cI think there are a lot of grandparents involved,\u201d said the 59-year-old social worker, who arrived from Derbyshire on Sunday. \u201cThis Cop really does feel like the last chance to turn things around. I\u2019m not feeling very hopeful but I still felt compelled to come here.\u201d\\nThis modest gathering \u2013 about 100 protesters \u2013 was typical of a smaller-than-expected protest presence so far at Cop26. No one is quite sure why, although anxiety about coronavirus is certainly playing a part. Activists argue, however, that it is also the result of exclusionary structures that go well beyond concerns about Covid transmission.\\nJoe Karp-Saway, of Global Justice Now, said people had been put off by Covid, \u201cbut also the huge cost of travel and accommodation to Glasgow and miscommunication from the UK government and UNFCCC [the United Nations framework convention on climate change], which means there are fewer civil society groups from the global south.\u201d\\nHe noted that these early days were just the start of actions that would be spread across the fortnight, as well as the larger mobilisations planned for this weekend when up to 100,000 people are expected to march in Glasgow, and similar demonstrations will take place across the UK and around the world.\\nThe XR activists moved off again carrying a pink lettered banner reading: \u201cHow many Cops to arrest climate chaos?\u201d When they arrived outside the venue later in the afternoon, the police closed the Clyde Arc, preventing protesters from continuing their march but also stopping other visitors who needed to get to events around the green zone across the river. The walk to the nearest open footbridge and back would take at least an hour.\\nInside the conference centre, Fatima Ibrahim, of Green New Deal Rising, was finding it hard to share Boris Johnson\u2019s cautious optimism about the summit. There was frustration and weariness among activists, she said. \u201cPeople are tired of rhetoric and false promises.\u201d The policing seemed heavy-handed to her. \u201cI\u2019ve not seen protesters greeted by police in the same way at previous Cops, while civil society is locked out of spaces within the blue zone.\u201d\\nFor those who made it across the river, youth and indigenous activists had gathering for speeches and another photocall, holding up illuminated letters spelling out \u201cEnd Climate Betrayal\u201d.\\nIn her speech, Mitzi Tan, a convener of Fridays For Future for the Philippines, sounded angry \u2013 the leaders aren\u2019t in there, she gestured across the river, they are in front of her, she told the small crowd, to hearty cheers.\\nThe mood among activists was angry, the 24-year-old from Manila agreed afterwards. \u201cIt\u2019s only been the second day but I\u2019ve already heard so many excuses.\u201d\\nHaving arrived in Glasgow on Sunday, she had been attending back-to-back events and meetings. \u201cI have no sense of time,\u201d she laughed, admitting she\u2019d started taking vitamin D supplements \u201cbecause I miss the sunlight so much\u201d.\\nIt was as important to be in Glasgow to build networks as to protest, she said. \u201cOne of the best feelings is meeting people from across the globe and hugging each other, because we\u2019ve been organising together online for a year and some of us have never met in person.\u201dOn Wednesday morning Ibrahim and her team challenged the UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, about why there was no mention of the climate in his recent budget, as he walked through the conference blue zone. His team demanded that they be removed before he addressed the plenary.\\nFor Green New Deal Rising this fortnight is also geared towards training up new activists: it will welcome 100 young people from across the UK to its hub at a warehouse in the east end of Glasgow. While the immediate momentum is building up to the weekend\u2019s marches, \u201creally what we are working towards is how to keep [leaders] accountable after 12 November\u201d.\\nAt lunchtime on Wednesday, Extinction Rebellion convened again for a protest against corporate green-washing in the city centre. As the drums boomed out, activists remarked on the swelling crowd of 300 or more, suggesting protest numbers were increasing as the week progressed.\\nMeanwhile, outside the conference hall, indigenous activists were converging after a march from Glasgow Green.\\nTxai Surui, the daughter of a tribal chief from the Brazilian Amazon, had delivered an eloquent appeal to the conference on Monday, telling delegates: \u201cThe Earth is speaking. She tells us that we have no more time.\u201d The 24-year-old has been wearing the bird feather headdress made for her by her father and uncle, fashioned \u201cfor going into battle\u201d she said.\\nLooking ahead to the weekend\u2019s marches, she urged people around the globe to participate. \u201cEverybody should go to these marches, to show the power and strength of all the people in this fight. This is going to be a moment for us to send a message that they cannot do whatever they want, because the power is with the people.\u201d", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60d8c82cbec64b7eef4bd6efd8b50b74911a446f/0_318_5760_3457/master/5760.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Indigenous leaders march in ceremonial dress to the Cope Scottish Event Campus."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c25a2879d8425e326416c42d9bd501eed038c1b1/0_58_5760_3457/master/5760.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Indigenous representatives from Alaska, US, Panama, Amazonia and Patagonia were among those marching."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa1dfa6b54fab65207d509a091716cc18a69a743/0_366_5760_3457/master/5760.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Activists urge negotiators to \u2018End Climate Betrayal\u2019 with concrete action over the next two weeks."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef2393d33054aa50d50477cbe2827198873dc8e5/0_191_5760_3457/master/5760.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Extinction Rebellion protesters outside J P Morgan financial services HQ."]], "author": ["Libby Brooks"], "date": "2021-11-03"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/05/indonesia-says-cop26-zero-deforestation-pledge-it-signed-unfair": {"title": "Indonesia says Cop26 zero-deforestation pledge it signed \u2018unfair\u2019", "subtitle": null, "text": "Environment minister of country home to world\u2019s third-biggest rainforest says deforestation pledge must not halt development\\nIndonesia has questioned the terms of a Cop26 deal to end deforestation by 2030, days after joining more than 100 countries in signing up to it.\\nThe nations agreed on the multi-billion-dollar plan at the climate conference in Glasgow this week to stop cutting down trees on an industrial scale in under a decade.\\nBut Siti Nurbaya Bakar, the environment minister for the south-east Asian archipelago, which is home to the world\u2019s third-biggest rainforest, said on Wednesday that \u201cforcing Indonesia to zero deforestation in 2030 is clearly inappropriate and unfair\u201d.\\nShe said that there were multiple ways to define deforestation, and that any deal could not halt economic growth. \u201cThe massive development of President Jokowi\u2019s era must not stop in the name of carbon emissions or in the name of deforestation,\u201d she said, referring to Joko Widodo by his nickname.\\nBakar said Indonesia could not \u201cpromise what we can\u2019t do\u201d and that Indonesia\u2019s priority was development, taking the example of forests that needed to be cut down to build new roads.

The heavy spinning did not help either.\\nOver the past fortnight, richer countries have been repeatedly challenged on their failure to hit the longstanding $100bn (\u00a375bn) targets for providing climate finance to the developing countries struggling with a climate crisis not of their making. That was not resolved here, and the final draft agreement published on Friday morning still grossly underestimates the necessary amounts, according to global debt campaigners.\\nAlthough the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, now UN special envoy on finance and Boris Johnson\u2019s finance adviser for Cop26, told the summit on finance day that $130tn of private capital was waiting to be deployed for just transition in the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (Gfanz), many are sceptical of how plausible it is to rely on big business to step into the breach. Many also concluded that further analysis of that huge figure would be necessary.\\nThere were low points for individual nations. A few days after the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, refused to sign the methane pledge during his brief and grudging attendance, his government\u2019s policy response to the climate crisis was ranked last in an assessment of 60 countries by the Climate Change Performance Index.\\nAnd this week it became embarrassingly apparent that the UK hosts were not joining the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, founded by Denmark and Costa Rica as a club of countries committed to phasing out oil and gas production.\\nAfter an expletive-strewn speech on arrival in Glasgow, the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg pledged to go \u201cnet zero on swearing\u201d, but she made no apology for the force of her fury at the school strikes rally last Friday. \u201cThis is no longer a climate conference,\u201d she told the crowd of 10,000 young people in George Square. \u201cThis is now a global north greenwash festival, a two-week-long celebration of business as usual and blah blah blah.\u201d\\nHer rage and frustration was shared by other activists who arrived over the first week, having struggled with Covid travel restrictions and overpriced accommodation. Many questioned why the green zone \u2013 where civil society, charities and campaigners meet \u2013 was set up across the river from the main conference site, and why there was so little public space directly outside the blue zone, meaning protests held there were regularly corralled by police.\\nThe \u201csaturation\u201d policing presence across the city \u2013 as well as reported instances of harassment of activists \u2013 had a chilling effect on protests, according to campaigners, with the anticipated disruptive direct action at a minimum during the first week.\\nRegardless \u2013 and despite buffeting winds and heavy rain \u2013 about 100,000 took to the streets in Glasgow, joining others across the world in a global day of action.\\nAs the summit has progressed, the stunts and actions have become more inventive \u2013 a troupe of giant Pikachu protesting against Japan\u2019s refusal to reduce coal consumption; \u201cEmotional Rebellion\u201d activists screaming out their climate anxiety in the drizzle by the River Clyde; and emissions campaigners deflating SUV tyres across the city.\\nThe responses became more inventive too: on Tuesday evening a guerilla protest projected slogans such as \u201cBan fracking now\u201d on to the summit venue, only to find their words covered over as the official projectionist beamed \u201cgo away\u201d across the arched roof of the Clyde auditorium.\\nThe legitimacy of the entire summit was called into question at the start of the second week, as observers representing hundreds of environmental, indigenous and women\u2019s rights organisations revealed they were being excluded from negotiating areas, given limited tickets and prevented from joining online due to technical glitches.\\nDespite UK government boasts that this summit would be the \u201cmost inclusive ever\u201d, a combination of Covid restrictions, travel costs and the UK\u2019s hostile immigration system has meant about two-thirds of civil society organisations who usually send delegates did not travel to Glasgow, resulting in a summit dismissed as the \u201cwhitest and most privileged ever\u201d.\\nThe focus on gender equality on Tuesday heard warm words acknowledging that women and girls often bear the brunt of the climate crisis, but a rally outside the summit put things more bluntly: for indigenous women \u201cfemicide is directly linked to ecocide\u201d.\\nThe former US president Barack Obama nearly lost the crowd when he described Scotland as \u201cthe Emerald Isle\u201d on Monday, but recovered sufficiently to be awarded a lifetime membership of the local student union.\\nOther celebrity visitors included the Hollywood actors Leonardo DiCaprio, who reportedly took a commercial flight to Glasgow to visit, and Idris Elba, who had the good grace to admit in his speech at the summit that he understood why \u201cpeople might be a little irritated\u201d to see celebrities weighing in on the climate crisis. The actor Emma Watson and singer Ellie Goulding detailed their meetings with campaigners on Instagram.\\nThe marketing people at AG Barr, makers of Scotland\u2019s beloved, bright orange fizzy drink Irn-Bru, may have had an inkling they were on to a good thing thanks to their sponsorship deal with the SEC convention centre where Cop26 was held.\\nBut the intense love it/loathe it debate among delegates during the first week of the summit reached stratospheric proportions when the US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez documented her first taste of the uniquely flavoured beverage on Wednesday.

But as it went on, the lack of engagement with the toughest issues started to tell\\n\u201cCash, coal, cars and trees\u201d to keep the world to 1.5 degrees \u2013 that was the catchy mantra coined by Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesperson before the Cop26 conference, summarising the UK\u2019s strategy of attacking the climate crisis on several fronts, to reverse the rise in greenhouse gas emissions and stave off climate breakdown.\\nThat push was expressed in a carefully orchestrated string of initiatives covering those four key elements, and a few more, spread across the two weeks of the conference. The choreography was a key part of the UK\u2019s plan: the Cop talks are dominated by backroom technical discussions over the fine details of the Paris agreement. Slow-moving and impenetrable to outsiders, these can give the (correct) impression of stalling and delay in the face of a global crisis.\\nSo to gain a sense of momentum, the UK plan was to launch the summit with world leaders, then keep up a steady stream of \u201cwins\u201d that would cover aspects of the climate crisis that lie outside the scope of the annual UN talks but are no less vital to its resolution.\\nWorld leaders brought their glamour to the start, when Joe Biden of the US and his counterparts Fumio Kishida, the prime minister of Japan, the leaders of EU member states, Australia\u2019s Scott Morrison and India\u2019s Narendra Modi flew in among the 120 heads of state and government. Missing were Xi Jinping of China and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, but the leaders\u2019 summit at the start gave the strong impetus the UK wanted.\\nThere were some fireworks among the leaders: Morrison faced embarrassment as France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron accused him of lying, in answer to a Guardian journalist\u2019s question. Biden picked a fight with Xi when he remarked: \u201cThey didn\u2019t show up \u2026 How do you do that and claim to have any leadership mantle?\u201d Modi made the surprise announcement that India would pursue net zero emissions \u2013 by the late date of 2070, but significant nonetheless, according to experts.\\nAs the leaders left the stage, the UK\u2019s plan for cash, coal, cars and trees kicked in. The raft of announcements served two purposes: they addressed major sources of greenhouse gas emissions, or major elements of the solutions to the climate crisis; and they gave an impression of momentum, while the talks themselves were locked behind closed doors in interminable discussions over the minutiae of the final text.\\nThe UK\u2019s strategy bore fruit, said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics. \u201cThe contributions of the world leaders, particularly Narendra Modi, and the important announcements of stronger action on deforestation and methane, for instance, did provide positive momentum and had real substance. This was important as negotiators moved on to the hard grind of hammering out agreed text for the final decision.\u201d\\nFirst among the initiatives was an agreement to halt deforestation by 2030, signed by more than 130 countries, on the second day of the talks. Forests act as carbon sinks but the loss and degradation of the rainforests of the Amazon, the Congo Basin and south-east Asia has vastly diminished their carbon-absorbing potential. Stemming the losses, restoring degraded land and planting new forests is essential to any attempt to limit temperature rises, and would strongly benefit nature and biodiversity.\\nCash refers to the need for climate finance, from rich to poor countries to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of the climate crisis. This has long been a key issue at the talks, one that dominated the closing discussions with developing countries deeply unhappy at the failure of the rich world to meet a promise made in 2009 that $100bn a year would flow to them from public and private sources by 2020. On the third day, more than 450 banks and financial institutions with a capitalisation of $130tn announced they would align their investments with net zero emissions by 2050, in a deal spearheaded by the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney.\\nHe told Cop: \u201cWhen the UK assumed the Cop presidency in partnership with Italy two years ago, $5tn of private financial assets were committed to net zero. Today, as part of the Glasgow financial alliance for net zero, over 450 major financial institutions from 45 countries are committing to manage their balance sheets totalling over $130tn in line with net zero. Make no mistake: the money is now there if the world truly wants to address climate change.\u201d\\nCoal is the dirtiest fossil fuel, and continuing dependency on it is the biggest reason why greenhouse gas emissions are set to climb again next year, according to the International Energy Agency. On the fourth day of Cop26, more than 40 countries agreed to phase out coal power in what Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, hailed as \u201ca milestone moment in our global efforts to tackle climate change, as nations from all corners of the world unite in Glasgow to declare that coal has no part to play in our future power generation \u2026 the end of coal is in sight\u201d.\\nFinally, in the second week of talks, the UK announced a deal on cars, by which more than 24 countries and several leading manufacturers committed to ending fossil fuel engines by 2040 or earlier, with Ford, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz among them.\\nAs well as these carefully choreographed initiatives, the US and the EU came forward with a deal, involving scores of countries, to cut emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that comes from animal husbandry, fossil fuel exploration and waste. If successful, the pledge to cut methane by 30% by 2030 would knock an estimated 0.2C off global heating, a valuable contribution with temperatures currently 1.1C above pre-industrial levels and rapidly heading towards the 1.5C threshold.\\nBut as the days wore on, and the announcements started to repeat or grow smaller in scope and impact, the hosts also came in for a barrage of criticism, as delegates suspected the announcements were not all that they seemed. First the forestry deal began to unravel, as Indonesia\u2019s environment minister claimed the country was not intending to keep to its target of ending forest loss this decade.\\nThen the finance deal also appeared overblown. Although the 450 banks and institutions signed up have a capitalisation of $130tn, only a small slice of their investments will be devoted to low-carbon efforts in the crucial next decade. These banks are also allowed, under the terms of the deal, to carry on pouring money into fossil fuels.\\nSimon Youel of Positive Money said: \u201cBanks may be preparing to scale up investment in \u2018green\u2019 activities, but this announcement said nothing about financial firms\u2019 investments in new fossil fuel projects.\u201d\\nWhen the spotlight fell on coal, the claim that the end of coal was in sight quickly fell apart. The full list of countries signing up to phasing out coal was not at first released to journalists \u2013 when it was, only 18 countries were found to have agreed to it, with most of the world\u2019s biggest users, including China, India and the US, missing. And when the cars announcement finally came in the second week of the conference, it was found that many major manufacturers \u2013 including Volkswagen, Toyota and BMW \u2013 had failed to sign up.\\nThe end result was for some delegates an appearance of spin, even greenwash. Mohamed Adow, director of the thinktank Power Shift Africa, accused the UK of \u201cdressing up empty promises as climate leadership\u201d, by pursuing fossil fuels at home \u2013 through new oil and gas fields, a potential new coalmine \u2013 and cutting overseas aid while exhorting other countries to provide more climate finance to the poor.\\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that rich nations would rather make pre-planned announcements and launch new schemes rather than get around the negotiating table with countries on the frontline of the climate crisis and commit their decisions to enhanced [national plans for emissions cuts] or the delivery of the promised $100bn by 2020.\u201d\\nJennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said: \u201cMost host governments dabble in a bit of media management but the UK\u2019s communications strategy in Glasgow is something different. It seems designed to dampen transparency and integrity. We actually want to find things to celebrate but it\u2019s hard when there is a constant concern that everyone is getting played.\u201d\\nFor the UK, if these deals produce tangible outcomes in the coming months and years, it will be vindication of a strategy that sought to spread the push for climate action beyond the narrow confines of a Cop meeting, where the focus is on the legalese and minutiae of a dry text \u2013 and where the discussions over the \u201crulebook\u201d for the Paris agreement alone have taken six years, with some aspects still not fully resolved. If the \u201cside deals\u201d prove to bear fruit in lower emissions, concerns about spin will be quickly forgotten.\\nA Cop26 spokesperson said: \u201cWe saw real momentum for climate action in the first week of Cop26, including major new commitments on ending our reliance on coal, increasing climate finance, tackling deforestation and plans to cut emissions. These were clearly communicated, showing the level of ambition at the summit and providing a firm foundation for further productive negotiations as we worked towards a final agreement.\u201d", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc5d4843d2326b6a9d338fd438ccd3f45eacbfcf/401_193_4335_2601/master/4335.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Alok Sharma, president of the Cop26 summit, left, talks to US climate envoy John Kerry."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcee79c7659b64fced55faf45279e8219865327f/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Activists wearing black hoods cloaks marked Cop7, Cop8, Cop9 and take part in a mock funeral at Glasgow Necropolis during Cop26."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0b23784b0e0736cd8f122a044a2a253e05f0526/1528_1302_3849_2309/master/3849.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "A Tuvalu delegate, holding up a photograph of three children on his mobile, speaks during a plenary session at Cop26."]], "author": ["Fiona Harvey"], "date": null}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/05/bit-like-a-clown-boris-johnson-makes-impression-cop26": {"title": "\u2018Like a clown\u2019: what other countries thought of Boris Johnson at Cop26", "subtitle": null, "text": "PM could not resist wheeling out the usual jokes and antics at crucial summit, but the laughs never came\\nIt was one of the defining images from Cop26.\\nSeated next to Boris Johnson on Monday and wearing a mask was 95-year-old David Attenborough. The prime minister, however, was maskless. At one point, Johnson seemed to have nodded off.\\nOn stage and in front of 120 world leaders, the contrast between the two men was striking. The naturalist was sombre and serious. There was a \u201cdesperate hope\u201d we might still avoid disaster, Attenborough said in Glasgow, in the most memorable phrase of the week. Joe Biden was among those to give him a standing ovation.\\nJohnson sought to strike a similarly elevated tone. There were serious moments in his speech: he mentioned a responsibility to future generations, for example, and to \u201cchildren not yet born\u201d.\\nBut overall the prime minister appeared to rely on the jokes and verbal antics that have served him well in the past. With the world watching on the most urgent issue of the age, he sought to mix it up \u2013 part statesman, part standup.\\nLabour said his speech seemed thrown together at the last moment. To many others, his quips seemed strangely unsuited to the grave occasion and to his non-British audience.\\nHe began by likening the climate crisis to James Bond wrestling with a ticking bomb. \u201cIt\u2019s one minute to midnight on that Doomsday Clock and we need to act now,\u201d he declared. (Days before, at the G20 summit in Rome, he had used football for his analogies \u2013 describing humanity as \u201c5-1 down at half time\u201d.)\\nJohnson\u2019s Cop26 address was met with stony silence. The prime minister left pauses for laughs. They never came.\\nOutside the hall, what did other countries make of a British leader who had once written sceptically about the climate emergency? Was his new evangelism for real, many wondered, or merely an act by someone adept at persuading people he holds certain beliefs?\\nAbroad, few were convinced. In Spain, El Pa\u00eds noted Johnson appeared to have undergone something of a Damascene conversion to environmentalism since the days when \u201cas a provocative political columnist for the Daily Telegraph, he flirted with a rather loutish kind of climate change denialism\u201d.\\nHis attempts to stress the importance of the meeting were undercut by a familiar idiosyncrasy, it said. \u201cHe wanted to appear \u2018cautiously optimistic\u2019, and yet he couldn\u2019t avoid slipping into his usual over-the-top rhetoric,\u201d the paper reported.\\nOthers felt his puns got lost in translation. Bas Eickhout, a long-serving Dutch Green MEP, observed: \u201cHe is regarded a bit like a clown. It\u2019s clear that this is his style and that is certainly now what people are used to. Some of the jokes are quite domestic orientated for a domestic audience.\u201d\\nAsked about Johnson\u2019s leadership, one EU official laughed, but offered a diplomatic take. \u201cIt\u2019s not completely my taste to be honest,\u201d the person said, sidestepping to praise the UK diplomatic machine. \u201cOne thing that we profit from is that the UK still has one of the best foreign services in the world. It\u2019s pretty difficult to break that up and they [Downing Street] haven\u2019t got round to it yet.\u201d\\nThe French media was also unimpressed, at a time when Paris and London are involving in a bitter spat over fishing. Le Point said Johnson had indulged in his \u201cusual humorous banter\u201d. \u201cWide-eyed, we observe Johnson\u2019s smirk; his face recalls that of a dad cracking one of his favourite jokes,\u201d it said.\\nLib\u00e9ration saw \u201cchaotic organisation\u201d on show at the summit; Le Monde \u201capparent nonchalance\u201d from the British side. \u201cHe seems a lot more interested in re-litigating Brexit with Brussels than with convincing global leaders to raise their CO2 reduction targets,\u201d the paper wrote.\\nGermany\u2019s Der Spiegel recalled the prime minister\u2019s climate speech in September to the UN general assembly when \u2013 bizarrely \u2013 he referenced Kermit the frog. \u201cWhen it comes to using zany metaphors to underline his message, Johnson has form,\u201d Spiegel said.\\nFor his part, Johnson insists his conviction that global heating poses an existential threat is real. Asked by the Guardian why he had become a believer, Johnson said he received a briefing from government scientists soon after becoming prime minister. It featured terrifying data and graphs, he recalled. Johnson\u2019s wife, Carrie, probably also played a role in changing his mind, or so everyone around him thinks.\\nYet doubts over Johnson\u2019s sincerity remain. He flew to Rome and then on to Glasgow in a luxurious chartered plane painted with \u201cUnited Kingdom\u201d and a union flag. The jet is used by Johnson and some royals for shorter trips. But why not travel back to London from Cop26 by train, a comfortable journey of four and a half hours? This was not possible, No 10 said, because of \u201ctime restraints\u201d.\\nOn Thursday, the reason for Johnson\u2019s haste became clear. The Mirror reported Johnson had flown back to London to attend a reunion of Daily Telegraph journalists at the men-only Garrick Club. He was pictured emerging from a dinner with Charles Moore, his old boss, whom Johnson recently made a Tory peer.\\nLord Moore has said there is no proof the planet faces a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d and accuses activists of \u201cproject fear\u201d.\\nAnneliese Dodds, the Labour party chair, said Johnson was guilty of \u201cstaggering hypocrisy\u201d. The charge sheet also includes reducing taxes on domestic passenger flights in last week\u2019s budget and equivocating on whether a controversial new coalmine should be built in Cumbria, at the same time as calling on China, the US, Australia and others to phase out coal production.\\nIt has left many environmentalists with a fear that Johnson has so far failed to heed his own apocalyptic rhetoric, even if he now grasps the problem.\\n\u201cWe hope world leaders listen to Johnson\u2019s warnings. But maybe he needs to listen to them himself,\u201d Greenpeace\u2019s Rebecca Newsom said.\\nAdditional reporting: Jennifer Rankin, Jon Henley, Sam Jones, Philip Oltermann, Tom Phillips", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62f5543c791747c4ed8d457747aa3883b41f9ce7/0_34_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Boris Johnson and Sir David Attenborough at the opening ceremony of Cop26"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ed46d9b72fac93f51cdd58a27ffee9c7de89374/0_41_2787_1673/master/2787.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Boris Johnson"]], "author": ["Luke Harding", "Peter Walker"], "date": "2021-11-05"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/11/sustainable-banger-jarvis-cocker-stars-on-climate-themed-dance-track": {"title": "\u2018Sustainable banger\u2019: Jarvis Cocker stars on climate-themed dance track", "subtitle": null, "text": "Pulp frontman weighs in on Cop26, Brexit and arts cuts as Let\u2019s Stick Around is released\\nJarvis Cocker has teamed up with the electronic DJ Riton to release what he calls \u201cthe world\u2019s first sustainable banger\u201d to encourage action to address the climate crisis.\\nLet\u2019s Stick Around, released on Thursday to coincide with Cop26, brings together one of the figureheads of Britpop with a powerhouse of electronic dance music. \u201cAnybody with any sense is passionate about the climate emergency, it\u2019s moving more into the centre of everybody\u2019s consciousness,\u201d Cocker said.\\nThe former Pulp frontman was approached to do the vocals last year by the Grammy-nominated Riton and Ben Rymer, who together make up Gucci Soundsystem.\\n\u201cIt seemed appropriate to unleash it on an unsuspecting world during Cop26,\u201d Cocker said. \u201cA lot of debates in the modern world devolve into people shouting at each other from opposite corners of a room. The idea was that anybody could dance to this song and agree with it. That\u2019s what music does so well. It brings people together.\u201d\\nCocker has long been an advocate for climate action. His concerts have featured stalls for Extinction Rebellion, some of whose members joined him on the Q awards red carpet in 2019.\\nHe said it was \u201chard to get a sense of the stilted announcements\u201d at Cop26, which involved a lot of \u201cdiscussions behind closed doors \u2026 There\u2019s still the idea that there\u2019s an elite of people who are going to tell you how the world works.\u201d An issue such as climate change that affects everyone also needed to include everyone, he said.\\nCocker, who is performing in Glasgow on Thursday with his solo band Jarv Is \u2026, lamented the fact that air travel was cheaper than rail. \u201cI\u2019m getting the train to Glasgow, but while that\u2019s the situation, nothing\u2019s going to change that much.\u201d\\nHe said climate solutions should not hinge on asking people to give things up, \u201cbecause it\u2019s never going to work. It\u2019s about doing things differently, like the experimentation with hydrogen fuel. Aeroplanes aren\u2019t going to disappear, it\u2019s just daft to think that people aren\u2019t going to go on holiday any more.\u201d\\nHis song (Cunts Are Still) Running the World has become an epic singalong on his current tour, but Cocker said he had been in two minds over whether to include it in the setlist. The late Tony Benn had taken him to task over the track, warning against cynicism and nihilism. \u201cHe said you\u2019ve got to believe in the democratic process. I took that to heart. But unfortunately, I still feel that the song is appropriate.\u201d\\nEarlier this year Cocker released an album of French music to accompany Wes Anderson\u2019s latest film, The French Dispatch. But the Sheffield-born singer, who has spent much of his life in Paris, where his son is based, said it was dispiriting that musicians were still having trouble touring in Europe post-Brexit.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s still really complicated and expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cNormally we would be preparing after this tour to do some shows in Europe.\u201d\\nCocker said Pulp\u2019s Common People, one of the biggest-selling records of the 90s \u2013 with lyrics centred on a meeting at Central Saint Martins \u2013 might not have been written today if government plans to limit the number of arts students go ahead.\\n\u201cThis idea that arts is not a proper job or a proper thing to study is stupid,\u201d he said. \u201cCreativity is the centre of the human experience. The first things that show you that people were alive are cave paintings or little bone carvings. It\u2019s how humans say we exist. It\u2019s not some kind of fringe pursuit.\\n\u201cMy life would have been so different if I hadn\u2019t had that opportunity to go to Saint Martins at the time that I did.

It illustrated how many imagine that the best means of arousing political concern is by painting as dark a picture as possible of social problems. And few things today speak more of evil than the Holocaust.\\nThe kind of facile optimism that a figure such as Boris Johnson exudes is deeply obnoxious. It\u2019s a way of avoiding the issues, of pretending that we can resolve our problems by not thinking deeply about them, but by simply asserting \u201cwe can do it\u201d.\\nThere is something equally objectionable about unthinking pessimism. About the insistence that a social problem is so beyond control that we cannot avoid catastrophe or so deeply rooted that it cannot be dug out. Yet this often seems to be the default setting for so many political discussions, from racism to the refugee crisis. And on no issue more so than climate change.\\nRoger Hallam, the co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, has given \u201cAdvice to Young People as They Face Annihilation\u201d. Describing social collapse after unchecked climate change, he warned in graphic terms that \u201cthis is what is going to happen to your generation\u201d: \u201cA gang of boys will break into your house demanding food. They will see your mother, your sister, your girlfriend and they will gang rape her on the kitchen table\u2026 They\u2019ll take a cigarette and burn out your eyes with it\u2026 That is the reality of climate change.\u201d\\nIt\u2019s difficult to know what such nihilistic despair is supposed to achieve or how imagining the world as a Mad Max film would make people more willing to take action. The novelist Jonathan Franzen insisted in the New Yorker magazine that people need to stop \u201cdenying reality\u201d and tell \u201courselves the truth\u201d that climate change \u201ccan\u2019t be solved\u201d. \u201cEvery day, instead of thinking of breakfast,\u201d he suggested, \u201cthey have to think about death.\u201d\\nNot surprisingly, this sense of bleakness and futility has seeped into wider culture. A recent international survey of young people found that 75% believed \u201cthe future is frightening\u201d, 56% thought \u201chumanity is doomed\u201d and 39% were \u201chesitant to have children\u201d.\\nClimate change is a critical issue and one that will require considerable political will and social resolve to challenge. Hallam and Franzen and similar thinkers insist that only an apocalyptic vision will persuade people to take action. In reality, as the environmental journalist Hannah Ritchie has observed: \u201cOnce anger transitions into hopelessness, we struggle to achieve much at all.\u201d Telling people that there is no future is hardly conducive to getting them to act to change it.\\nIt\u2019s not just on climate change that pessimism has colonised the debate. Consider discussions of racism. From the widening scandal over Yorkshire County Cricket Club\u2019s treatment of former player Azeem Rafiq to the trial in America of three white men for the death of jogger Ahmaud Arbery, racism dominates much of the news. Central to the debate is the insistence on the need to root out \u201cinstitutional racism\u201d. And yet, for all such talk, many, whether columnists or corporations, see racism as the property not of social structures but of white people. Once racism is rendered the product of whiteness, it becomes, in the words of Robin DiAngelo, author of White Fragility and doyenne of the \u201cwhite people are the problem\u201d school, \u201cunavoidable\u201d, something that will endure as long as white people exist. That is why \u201cprogressives\u201d confronting racism \u201ccause the most damage to people of colour\u201d because of their dreams of eradicating racism.\\nDiAngelo has a nice line in monetising white guilt, but serious black thinkers have equally made the case for taking a bleak view. The US writer Ta-Nehisi Coates was acclaimed by the late Toni Morrison as the new James Baldwin for his challenging arguments and exquisite prose. White supremacy, Coates suggests, is like a natural force beyond reach of human solutions. \u201cThe earthquake cannot be subpoenaed. The typhoon will not bend under indictment\u201d, as he puts it in his book Between the World and Me. Coates is part of a school of thought, sometimes called \u201cAfropessimism\u201d, nurtured by writers such as Frank Wilderson and Patrice Douglass, who argue that little can change for black people and that, in Wilderson\u2019s words, \u201cBlackness is coterminous with slaveness\u201d.\\nSuch arguments are not, of course, part of everyday, mainstream discussion. Yet the success of figures such as DiAngelo and Coates and the entrenchment of the view of racism as an issue of whiteness show how these ideas can infect wider circles.\\nIt might seem odd to talk of pessimism or despair in the age of Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion. However, a paradox of our time is that passionate protest often coexists with a sense of fatalism about possibilities of change. Much has been made of the disruption caused by Insulate Britain\u2019s tactics of closing off motorways. All protests cause some disruption. The real problem with Insulate Britain is that it has become an end in itself, protesters seemingly unconcerned about alienating people, rather than winning them over to their side.\\nUnderlying much of this is a sense of despair about human beings, who, in the the words of philosopher David Benatar, not only constitute \u201cthe most destructive species\u201d but whose lives are \u201cfilled with dishonesty, betrayal, negligence, cruelty, hurtfulness, impatience, exploitation\u201d. It is, he says, best that no human is born because of \u201cthe harm that the created person will (likely) do\u201d. Again, most people probably abhor the better-never-to-have-been-born argument and yet that sense of cynicism about human activity finds a wider hearing.\\nThere is a long history of misanthropic pessimism, largely within the conservative tradition. For them, the flaws of human nature are reason to shun what they regard as utopian schemes for social change. \u201cThose who struggle to change the world,\u201d the philosopher John Gray suggests, are merely seeking \u201cconsolation for a truth they are too weak to bear\u201d.\\nWhat is different today is that such pessimism and misanthropy have come to colonise much of the left, too. This, as much as climate change or racism, is an issue to confront. Otherwise, despair about challenging such problems will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.\\nKenan Malik is an Observer columnist", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25ca21e506799b71424f4e162adcf591c464aea5/3_0_10661_6400/master/10661.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Illustration: Dominic McKenzie."]], "author": ["Kenan Malik"], "date": null}, "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/26/uk-poised-for-record-black-friday-sales": {"title": "Shoppers go to town as UK rings in biggest-ever Black Friday sales day", "subtitle": null, "text": "Data from banks and card issuers suggests consumers on track to spend almost \u00a39.2bn this weekend\\nThe UK has rung up its biggest Black Friday sales day ever, data suggests, with shoppers spending more than one-fifth more than last year as the high street bounced back from pandemic lockdowns.\\nThe number of payments via Barclaycard, one of the UK\u2019s biggest debit and credit card issuers, were up 23% between midnight and 5pm compared with the same period in 2020, when most of the UK high street was in lockdown, and was up 2.4% on 2019.\\nHowever, Rob Cameron, the chief executive of Barclaycard Payments, said he did not expect total sales to be too far ahead of 2019 as some more expensive items, such as kitchen appliances and electronics, were not selling as well because of supply problems.\\nHe said independent businesses were benefiting from the return to high streets but restaurants, cafes were likely to be the big winners as families and friends made the most of being able to gather together again. \u201cPeople are going back to more in-person experiences,\u201d he said.\\nNationwide said its customers had made 5.95m purchases by 5pm, 26% up on last year and 24% up on 2019.

But it\u2019s not, it\u2019s very far from it, and they are downplaying the need to get short-term targets for 2030 in line with 1.5C.\u201d\\nEmissions will be twice as high in 2030 as they need to be to stay within 1.5C, based on promises made in Glasgow, CAT found. Scientists have warned that beyond 1.5C, some of the damage to the Earth\u2019s climate will become irreversible.\\nThe analysts also found a chasm between what countries have said they will do on greenhouse gas emissions and their plans in reality. If current policies and measures are taken into account, rather than just goals, heating would rise to 2.7C, based on the CAT analysis.\\nThe findings should serve as a \u201creality check\u201d to the talks, said Niklas H\u00f6hne, one of the authors. \u201cCountries\u2019 long-term intentions are good, but their short-term implementation is inadequate,\u201d he told the Guardian.\\nThe 197 parties to the 2015 Paris agreement were asked to come to Glasgow with two aims: a long-term goal of reaching global net zero emissions around mid-century; and shorter-term national plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), pegging emissions reductions to 2030. Scientists say greenhouse gas emissions must fall by about 45% this decade for global temperatures to stay within 1.5C of pre-industrial levels.\\nCountries responsible for about 90% of global emissions have signed up to net zero goals, mostly by around 2050 for developed countries, rising to 2060 for China and 2070 for India, but the NDCs for actions in the next decade do not match up. The climate responds to the cumulative carbon in the atmosphere, so if emissions are high enough in the next two decades the world could surpass the 1.5C limit even if carbon reaches net zero later.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that countries have long-term net zero targets, but they need to close the gap with short-term measures,\u201d said Hare.\\nThe first week of the Cop26 talks was dominated by a rush of announcements, including commitments on preserving forests, private sector finance for clean energy, and countries phasing out coal. Some of these quickly started to unravel as countries appeared to renege or clarify some of their commitments.\\nAt the start of the second week of the fortnight-long talks, sharp rifts are appearing between countries that want tougher action, specifically to force countries to revise their NDCs annually if they are not in line with 1.5C, and others wanting to stick to the Paris timetable of five-yearly revisions. There are also disputes about how countries should monitor emissions, and over climate finance for poor countries.\\nHare noted there was no contradiction among the varying assessments, published last week by Melbourne University and the International Energy Agency, as they came to similar conclusions based on long-term goals. CAT also found in its \u201coptimistic scenario\u201d that if all targets countries had promised were fully met, temperatures would rise by 1.8C.\\nThe UN environment programme updated its analysis of the \u201cemissions gap\u201d between the cuts needed to stay within 1.5C and those offered by governments. Unep found that with the recently announced pledges by China, Saudi Arabia and others, temperatures were likely to rise by between 1.9C and 2.1C, but like the IEA and Melbourne estimates, that depended on long-term pledges being fully implemented.\\nHare said many of the long-term goals countries had set out lacked credibility. He pointed to Brazil, Australia and Russia. \u201cWe are concerned that there is not a seriousness of purpose at Cop26. It\u2019s very hypothetical, getting to net zero in 2050,\u201d he said.\\nH\u00f6hne said countries must agree to revise their NDCs every year if they were found insufficient, adding: \u201cIf we came back every five years that would be a very bad choice. If countries agree to come back every year, they would have a chance of closing the gap.\u201d\\nJennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace International, said: \u201cThis new calculation is like a telescope trained on an asteroid heading for Earth. It\u2019s a devastating report. We have until the weekend to turn this thing around. That means countries agreeing how they\u2019re going come back next year and every year after that until the gap to 1.5C is closed. The ministers shouldn\u2019t leave this city until they\u2019ve nailed that.\u201d\\nA Cop26 spokesperson said: \u201cWe know that the window to keep 1.5C alive is closing but the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is clear that it is still achievable. As today\u2019s reports make clear, we\u2019ve seen genuine progress in the first week of Cop26, but we have a lot more to do.\u201d\\nLabour\u2019s Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cThe test of Cop26 has always been what concrete commitments it would deliver by 2030, the decisive decade to keep 1.5C alive. This report is an important reality check on the government\u2019s attempt to greenwash Glasgow.\u201d\\nGreen party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said: \u201cToday was the day the sugar coating fell off the Cop26 talks to reveal the bitter pill that world leaders are going to force us to swallow if they don\u2019t take much stronger action. This report shows that action in the next 10 years is vital. Long term targets, promises and non-existent technofixes, with no actual policies to get us there, are worth nothing. It shows that most global leaders have been asleep at the wheel.

Act one would see the leaders of wealthy countries such as Britain, the US and Australia smiling broadly as they strut the Glasgow stage with their friends, wring their hands and manage the world\u2019s expectations. Act two would see them knifing each other offstage and kicking poor countries hard before running away.\\nThe climate crisis conference, now halfway through its second week, is well into act two and the final scenes are being rehearsed in late-night talks. In a dramatic early-morning move, Alok Sharma and the UK presidency acting as the protagonist, listened to countries and produced a seven page draft \u201cnon-paper\u201d that sets the broad outline of the final agreement that it thinks it may be diplomatically possible to reach.\\nIt is only a first draft but to many of the players in this drama it already bodes ill, because, despite the fine words and the supposed ambition, it seems very much to reflect the agenda of the rich. It is welcomed by some because it repeats the 1.5C goal as the critical temperature target, and for the first time calls on countries to speed up the phasing out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies.\\nBut it\u2019s what is not in the draft that is just as important. It is full of words such as \u201curges\u201d and \u201crecognises\u201d but there is no mention of the $100bn a year that the rich countries pledged nine years ago to help the poor adapt to climate change; no acceptance of their financial or moral responsibility for disasters; nothing about transparency or carbon markets; no plan or proposal to phase out other fossil fuels; and no acceptance that wealthy countries should act first.\\nNow the stage is being re-set for the world\u2019s poor and most vulnerable countries to push back hard and try to get genuine commitments to act. The many groups of small island states, least developed nations, Africans and Latin Americans are genuinely shocked, and worried. Not only is the world on course for a catastrophic 2.4C rise in temperature and nowhere near the 1.5C target, they say, but it looks from this draft as if they are being abandoned and denied the right to either develop with coal or be financially helped to adapt to a crisis they did not cause.\\nEnter the chorus of NGOs, youth groups, indigenous peoples and charities that now step forward as the loud voice of the people. They, too, are shocked by the draft\u2019s seeming lack of ambition and tell rich countries to be far more forceful. \u201cThese empty words are way off target to meet the scale of the enormous challenge facing humanity,\u2019 says a spokesperson for ActionAid. \u201cFar from being a real plan by governments to solve a worsening climate crisis, it is more a polite request that countries maybe, possibly, perhaps do more next year or sometime in the future,\u201d says a Greenpeace representative.\\nFrom this point on in the Cop26 drama, the lines have not been written and it\u2019s impossible to guess which direction the talks will go. Just possibly, the UK will play a blinder, its diplomats furiously twisting arms, calling in favours, bringing out the cash and conjuring the missing words that the poorer nations want; but it\u2019s equally likely that Boris Johnson has overestimated his ability to bring countries together, misread the mood of the meeting and left it too late to retrieve. That might explain why the PM has rushed back to Glasgow, possibly having been made aware that diplomatic shame looms without intervention at the highest level. There is little time left to close the gaps and precious little goodwill to take in to the critical last two days of negotiations.\\nIt is now a genuine thriller that could go either way. Over the next 36 hours, many more drafts will be cobbled together by the UK only to be rejected. But if Cop26 is anything like so many others, the poorer countries will eventually fall in line behind the more powerful ones and a shorter text will be put before the world and reluctantly accepted. The rich nations, again, will probably have their way.\\nBut it may be many years before the critics declare Cop26 to have been a farce, a tragedy or an unlikely spectacular hit.\\nJohn Vidal is a former Guardian environment editor", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b116524ed9ba4b97af7ea7f65071c1d9ff214ea5/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "An indigenous Amazonian woman protests with Extinction Rebellion in Glasgow."]], "author": ["John Vidal"], "date": "2021-11-10"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/06/nicola-sturgeon-says-glasgow-climate-march-will-be-policed-appropriately": {"title": "\u2018The time for change is now\u2019: demonstrators around the world demand action on climate crisis", "subtitle": null, "text": "Up to 100,000, including Kahnawake Mohawk delegates, brave Glasgow rain as 22 arrested after scientists blockade bridge\\nPeople on almost every continent were gathering for marches and rallies on Saturday to mark a Global Day for Climate Justice, halfway through the Glasgow climate change summit.\\nActivists in the Philippines, eight hours ahead of the UK, had already finished their rally as protesters gathered in Scotland.

The bridge was blocked until just before 4pm, and the group said that 21 people had been arrested.\\nLater on Saturday, Gary Ritchie, Police Scotland assistant chief constable, said: \u201cGlasgow has today hosted a public protest the size and scale of which was beyond anything many of us \u2026 can ever remember.\u201d\\nThe day had \u201cpassed largely without incident\u201d, he said, but \u201ca group of people was contained by officers after their conduct deteriorated, pyrotechnic devices were used and they brought the procession to a halt\u201d.

We\u2019re here to put indigenous voices at the forefront of the climate crisis.\u201d\\nCop delegates were also scattered among the huge crowds. Tracy Sonny, 37, a Cop negotiator from Botswana focused on climate adaptation and capacity building, was at the march to show solidarity and call for more unity. \u201cWe need to see more political will and a change in mindset \u2026 we\u2019re already feeling the impact of climate change; we need to respond now, people are drowning.\u201d\\nDespite the dreich weather, the atmosphere was electric as each bloc made itself heard with live music and chants such as \u201csystem change not climate change\u201d and \u201cworld leaders at Cop26 \u2026 your inaction makes us sick.\u201d\\nGrainne McGinn, 22, a wheelchair user from Glasgow, attended Friday\u2019s youth protest and Saturday\u2019s with a sign that read \u201csustainability requires accessibility\u201d. \u201cClimate change is so important but youth voices, especially disabled youth voices, are not being heard. We\u2019ve seen in the news how inaccessible Cop has been for delegates. That\u2019s the day-to-day experience for all disabled people and it\u2019s so important that our voices are heard in the conversation on climate change. I\u2019m here to represent.\u201d\\nVegan activists fought strong gales to make their point with four giant inflatable animals tethered on ropes above their heads or strapped to the ground. Each symbolised a different problem with the livestock industry: a cow for methane, a chicken for Covid and health, a fish for microplastics, and a pig for obesity. \u201cThe cow in the room is being ignored at this Cop,\u201d said Carl Le Blanc of Climate Healers. \u201cAnimal agriculture has been taken off the agenda and put on the menu.\u201d\\nRoisin Greaney, 28, a postgrad student from Dublin said: \u201cI\u2019m here today because, I would say a small group of people but in this case it\u2019s a very large group of people, wants to put a sustained pressure on the people inside the blue zone.\\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen it in the past, I\u2019ve seen small groups of people come together and scare governments, scare companies, and make them do things.

And a significant percentage is exported. It\u2019s not a question of eating more or less or producing more or less. The question is making production more sustainable.\u201d\\nHe told the Guardian in an interview at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow that livestock production could be made more efficient, and the amount of methane produced by farm animals reduced, which along with other measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture would be enough to reduce carbon from farming.\\nRuminants such as cattle and sheep produce methane, as does animal manure. The potent greenhouse gas has a heating effect about 80 times greater than carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, though it breaks down sooner. Meat accounts for about 60% of greenhouse gas production from agriculture, which itself is one of the highest carbon-producing sectors globally.\\nThe US, the EU and scores of other countries signed a deal at Cop26 to reduce global methane emissions by 30% by 2030, though none of the countries have taken on a firm national reduction goal under the deal. If the target is reached, global heating could be reduced by about 0.2C.\\nVilsack said: \u201cIf you reduce methane by livestock by 30%, by food additives or different feed, or you capture the methane to biogas \u2013 take the manure and use it as biofuel \u2013 then you have made livestock production more sustainable. I do not think you need to reduce meat consumption to get that.\u201d\\nHe added: \u201cIf we are going to feed 9 billion people, you need meat protein. We will need plant, animal and fish protein.\u201d\\nHe said the US was financing demonstration projects for new technology and farming methods that would reduce methane.\\nGreen campaigners have focused on meat eating as a key source of greenhouse gas emissions around the world, but particularly in the US where a meat-heavy diet has become the norm over decades. People in the US eat close to 100kg of meat a year, more than any other country, although there has been a trend towards healthier eating among younger people in recent years.\\nMeat-eating is also a driver of deforestation around the world, as rainforest in countries such as Brazil is cleared for cattle ranches and to produce animal feed.\\nJohn Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cIt\u2019s time politicians stopped giving cover to the industrial meat industry.

All of these small incidents add up to create an atmosphere of fear and repression, and have a chilling effect on the right to protest.\u201d\\nThese reports stand in stark contrast to Police Scotland\u2019s repeated insistence that policing of protests would be \u201chuman rights-based\u201d and \u201cwelcoming, friendly and proportionate\u201d.\\nThe assistant chief constable Gary Ritchie said officers had \u201cenjoyed very positive engagement and constructive relationships with the vast majority of people\u201d who had come to Glasgow to \u201chave their voices heard and engage in peaceful protest\u201d.\\nThere is a view among some activists that mutual aid officers from English forces notorious for their heavy-handed tactics are undermining Police Scotland\u2019s approach.\\nOn Monday, occupants of a disused building in Glasgow that was squatted to provide emergency accommodation for activists accused the Metropolitan police and Welsh forces of trying to break into the site with batons drawn in the middle of the night, and reported that the situation was only calmed when Police Scotland officers arrived.\\nA spokesperson for Police Scotland confirmed that officers went to the building. However, Police Scotland denied that the operation was a raid or an attempt to force entry, or that a battering ram was used.\\nPolice Scotland have said mutual aid officers are working under the command and control of their chief constable.\\nBefore the summit beginning, many were expecting high-impact disruption from protest groups such as Extinction Rebellion. This has not transpired, with organisers saying they wanted to maintain focus on indigenous and youth voices, but despite this XR activists have told the Guardian of being regularly followed and harassed by police since their arrival in Glasgow.\\nDuring a protest against greenwashing last Wednesday, XR activists were kept stationary by a police cordon for several hours. During that period \u2013 which activists described as \u201ckettling\u201d because they were unable to leave, and which Police Scotland called \u201ccontainment\u201d \u2013 those inside the cordon reported having no access to food or water, and march stewards had to construct a makeshift toilet space with banners to allow people to relieve themselves above a drain.\\nScotland\u2019s justice minister, Keith Brown, when asked by the Scottish Greens at Holyrood on Tuesday about this and other reports of kettling, defended the police actions as \u201cproportionate\u201d. He said they had been discussed by the independent advisory group for Cop26, which was set up to inform the human rights-based approach. But others on the group have stressed that it is not a substitute for legally enforced scrutiny of police actions.\\nCampaigners have also raised concerns about the policing of the Climate Justice protest last Saturday, in which at least 100,000 people marched through Glasgow city centre. Organisers say they were promised there would be only blue-jacketed police liaison officers walking with marchers, while conventional yellow-jacketed officers would block roads as required.\\nBut stewards described conventional police becoming increasingly interventionist as the march progressed, splitting up prearranged marching blocs without offering a reason and increasing tensions by stopping one section of marchers. After an initial delay in the first bloc of indigenous groups setting off, stewards claim that conventional officers harassed marchers, including indigenous elders who needed breaks along the walk, to catch up the lost time.\\nQuan Nguyen, the Scottish coordinator of the activist group Cop26 Coalition, said: \u201cFor the majority the march was still a positive experience but that was despite police actions, which made our job as organisers much harder.

However, in the confusion Ann-Marie Horne managed to get a few secret shots and was able to smuggle out the film of the incident by concealing it in her vagina. Her pictures showed the commandos armed with knives and truncheons. The pictures and story consequently made groundbreaking news, stoking the nuclear testing controversy.\\nAfter the Vega incident, Greenpeace made a pledge to photograph everything it did. It quickly learned how to harness the power and strength of emotive images bringing the world shocking scenes of seal pups clubbed by hunters and the inspirational images of activists standing up to whaling ships.\\nActivists in protective suits painting \u2018Amazon Crime!\u2019 in white paint on the freighter MV Enif ship which was loaded with timber from Brazil in Hamburg , Germany, in 2000.

Examining the period since the landmark Paris agreement was signed in 2015, the analysis found Australia emitted 5.34 tonnes of carbon dioxide per person each year, placing it ahead of South Korea (3.81), South Africa (3.19), the US (3.08) and the world\u2019s biggest outright emitter, China (2.71).\\nEmber cited the International Energy Agency to argue OECD countries including Australia should end coal power by 2030 if they were to play their part in attempting to keep global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels \u2013 a goal of the Paris agreement \u2013 within reach.\\nThe Morrison government has rejected this and did not join a group of countries that pledged to phase out burning coal for electricity.\\nDave Jones, Ember\u2019s global program lead, said Cop26 had seen a divergence between developing Asian countries and major OECD coal users over the need to close coal generation. Vietnam had pledged to stop building coal plants and to stop using it in the 2040s, and Indonesia, the Philippines and India had shown signs they were changing previously held positions.\\nHe said by comparison arguments put forward by Australia, Japan and South Korea were \u201cembarrassing\u201d and \u201csimply untenable\u201d.\\n\u201cThey will undoubtedly be forced to change their position in the coming months,\u201d Jones said.\\nBan Ki-moon, a former UN secretary general and deputy chair of The Elders, an international non-governmental organisation of senior statespeople, said the potential of renewable energy was growing exponentially and OECD countries needed to align with the target of phasing out coal entirely by the end of the decade. \u201cThis will be a true demonstration of global leadership,\u201d he said.\\nAbout 60% of Australia\u2019s electricity over the past year came from burning coal. That proportion is gradually diminishing and the country\u2019s coal fleet is ageing, but under current closure schedules it would continue to use coal power until the late 2040s.\\nThe Morrison government has been heavily criticised in Glasgow for its ongoing support of fossil fuels. Greenpeace International head Jennifer Morgan grouped it with Saudi Arabia as a \u201cwrecker\u201d opposed to the action needed to cut emissions and provide the finance needed to help developing countries respond.\\nAustralia was one of only four countries, along with Indonesia, Mexico and Singapore, that chose to just resubmit the same 2030 emissions target at Cop26. Australia\u2019s has committed to only a 26-28% cut compared with 2005 levels, though government projections suggest it could make a cut of up to 35%, in part due to state government policies. Scientists have advised global emissions need to be cut by 45% by the end of the decade.\\nMary Robinson, a former president of Ireland and chair of The Elders, said leaders of developing countries were \u201cin crisis mode\u201d at the talks but some leaders who could do the most to address the problem were not. She bracketed Australia with Saudi Arabia, Brazil, China and Russia.\\n\u201cAustralia, a wealthy country, is still in fossil fuel mode, not in crisis mode,\u201d she told the UK\u2019s Sky News.\\nThe talks were boosted late on Wednesday by a surprise joint declaration by the two biggest emitters, China and the US, that they would work together to cut emissions in the crucial next decade.\\nBut there was significant disagreement between countries over a draft text released Wednesday morning.\\nIt included a proposal that countries return to the negotiating table next year with new plans to ramp up emission cuts this decade. Under the Paris agreement, countries are expected to return with better pledges in 2025 but - with a chasm between existing commitments and the deep cuts needed - many are now demanding the deadline should be brought forward.\\nThe draft text also proposed countries agree to accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels.\\nAustralia has not been represented at a political level at the talks since Angus Taylor, the emissions reduction minister, left a week ago, and it has not made public its position on key parts of draft text released on Wednesday morning. But Scott Morrison has previously strongly opposed suggestions coal power should be actively phased out, and said he has no plans to increase Australia\u2019s 2030 commitment.\\nIn a statement on Thursday, Taylor said Australia was \u201can active and constructive participant in the negotiations to ensure a positive outcome\u201d.\\nThere is dispute between countries over whether the text will keep a reference to the scientific case for limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, with some large developing countries reportedly opposed.

The results revealed voters fractured into bitterly opposed camps.\\nIn the UK, 88% of Labour voters said they disliked Conservative politicians and 73% said they disliked Conservative supporters. Similarly, 74% of Tory supporters said they disliked Labour politicians and 45% disliked Labour voters.\\nHostility was even stronger in the US, where 93% of Trump supporters said they disliked Democratic politicians and 90% of Biden voters said the same of Republican politicians. Antipathy towards the other camp\u2019s voters was at similar levels.\\nThe survey found the same divides around defining culture war labels: asked if they considered themselves a feminist, for example, 64% of Conservative voters in the UK and 85% of Trump supporters in the US said no, while 53% of Labour supporters and 58% of Biden voters said yes.\\nBut when asked about their attitudes to some of the issues underlying the label \u201cfeminist\u201d, people appeared considerably less polarised. One question asked whether three jobs \u2013 cleaner, nurse and politician \u2013 were more suited to women or men, or equally suited to all genders.\\nLarge majorities \u2013 generally between 75% and 90% \u2013 of both Conservative and Labour voters in the UK, and of Trump and Biden supporters in the US, responded that they considered all three jobs were equally suited to all genders.\\nThe survey also found majorities in both tribes in the US and UK felt it was unacceptable for a man to \u201cwhistle in the street at a woman he does not know\u201d and that \u201cpromoting equality for women\u201d should be a priority for society. Only small percentages disagreed.\\nThe phenomenon was replicated in other countries. In France, 69% of supporters of President Emmanuel Macron (69%) and 55% of backers of the far-right leader Marine Le Pen expressed dislike for each other, but many held overlapping views on equality for women, with 80% of Macron voters and 71% of Le Pen voters saying it should be a high or medium priority.\\nThe pattern was broadly the same among supporters of Germany\u2019s Green party and Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland, the ruling national-conservative Law & Justice (PiS) party and the Left in Poland, the far-right Vox party and leftwing Podemos in Spain, and New Democracy and Syriza in Greece.\\nOther hot-button topics showed the same picture in the US, UK and elsewhere. Clear majorities of Labour (66%) and Biden (72%) supporters declared themselves very or fairly favourable towards the anti-racism organisation Black Lives Matter, with while only 5% of Trump supporters and 17% of Tory voters shared the same opinion.\\nBut when asked how important \u201ccombating racisms of all kinds\u201d should be for their country, clear majorities of Conservative (80%), Labour (94%) and Biden (92%) voters said it should be a high or medium priority, along with 47% of Trump voters.\\nIn the UK, attitudes towards Extinction Rebellion were a similarly poor reflection of people\u2019s feelings about the underlying issue of climate change. About 63% of Conservative voters and 23% of Labour voters expressed an unfavourable view of about the environmental campaign group.\\nMajorities in both camps, however, shared broadly the same views on substantive environmental issues, with 72% of Tory supporters and 90% of Labour supporters saying that \u201cmoving away from carbon-intensive industries towards greener alternatives\u201d should be a high or medium priority for their country.\\n\u201cNone of this is to say that significant divides do not exist in political and social attitudes,\u201d said the authors of the survey, carried out in August and September, adding that the findings supported the emerging theory that people are more influenced by identity than issues.\\n\u201cThe point is that when we compare people by their attitudes to specifics of issues, rather than by markers of identity, we find [most] are not cleaved into separate, polarised clusters, or ranged against each other with clashing visions.\u201d\\nThe authors identified two other notable findings: in several countries, supporters of leftwing parties were more likely to be antipathetic towards supporters of rightwing parties than the reverse; and in the UK, Brexit remains a more significant marker of political identity than party affiliation.\\nIn the US, 86% of Biden supporters said they disliked Trump voters, compared with 73% the other way round. The pattern also held in France for Macron and Le Pen voters (69% v 55%), in Poland for the Left and PiS (85% v 48%), and in Greece for Syriza and New Democracy (70% v 60%).\\nIn the UK, only half of Tory and Liberal Democrat voters, and 64% of Labour voters, said they felt a common sense of identity with people who voted with them in the 2019 general election.

Every night, like-minded supporters hold a vigil outside the prison, and every day he receives a stream of\u00a0letters from well-wishers.\\nBut there is a silence from the newspapers. Why has no one reported on the huge level of support for this man? Why has there been no questioning in the mainstream press of such a harsh and disproportionate sentence?

I was born here and I\u2019ve seen many terrible things: so much destruction, so much deforestation, so many illegal mines.

Amazon destruction rose to its highest levels in 15 years between 2020 and 2021 when an area more than half the size of Wales was lost.\\nLast week the Bolsonaro administration was accused of deliberately withholding new government data laying bare the scale of the deforestation crisis to avoid international humiliation during the Cop climate summit, which Brazil\u2019s president declined to attend.\\nAguiar, a Greenpeace spokesperson for the Amazon, said Bolsonaro\u2019s pro-development rhetoric was partly to blame for the gold rush playing out on the Madeira River.
