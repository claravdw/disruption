Her new book reveals their callous tricks\\nWith hindsight, the environmental activist Helen Steel, a key figure in the 1990s McLibel case, can see that her life with John Dines was suspiciously idyllic.\\nWhen they met, at a London Greenpeace meeting in the late 1980s, she was spending her free time protesting against nuclear weapons at Greenham Common, or staying in mining villages supporting striking miners. Soon he was enthusiastically joining her on hunt saboteur trips to disrupt grouse shoots in Yorkshire, or on demonstrations against the poll tax, and spending his weekends with her, helping to campaign against the environmental record of McDonald\u2019s.\\nIt was only decades after their relationship ended that she began to understand that they got on so well because Dines was using a battery of grooming techniques perfected by colleagues in an undercover police division. The undercover officers in Dines\u2019s unit presented themselves as vulnerable and alone in the world; often they would say they were recently bereaved or estranged from their families, preying on the women\u2019s good nature, inviting their sympathy and love.\\nThe first time Steel went to the pub with Dines, he said his father had died very suddenly. A few months later, he told her his mother had also died unexpectedly; he said he was short of money, so she lent him the funds to fly to New Zealand for the funeral. She began to feel sorry for him and somehow these feelings evolved into a more complicated sense of attachment. Steel was just 23 when they met and was initially surprised that a man five years older than her should be so interested, but they seemed to have a lot in common, particularly their politics, so when he asked her out, eventually she agreed.\\nThey found a flat in London and moved in together. They had wonderful holidays in the Outer Hebrides and at Camber Sands. All the while he was telling her he wanted to buy a small house in the countryside with his inheritance, somewhere he could dig a duck pond for her and they could settle down and have six children.\\n\u201cWe got on so well, sharing many of the same interests and never having arguments \u2026 Life with John was idyllic,\u201d she writes in Deep Deception, an extraordinary account of how undercover officers from the Metropolitan police\u2019s special demonstration squad (SDS) deceived dozens of women into fake relationships, co-written with four other women who were similarly ensnared.\\n\u201cAll of us began by thinking that the men had in some way genuinely cared about us \u2013 even after we discovered that they were undercover officers,\u201d she says now, describing how her anger mounted steadily as she researched and wrote the book. \u201cAs we talked through what happened to us, we saw so many patterns; it really rammed it home that there weren\u2019t any genuine moments \u2013 they were purely manipulative and abusive.\u201d\\nThroughout the time they were together, Dines was married to someone else; his parents were alive and well. When his deployment was over, he left a note on the kitchen table telling her that he needed some space and abruptly disappeared.\\nThere can be no clearer example of misogyny within the Met than the undercover police division\u2019s treatment of these women, who were duped into relationships by officers who used them to construct convincing alter egos, to mask the surveillance work they were doing on small, mostly left-leaning and non-violent protest groups.\\n\u201cI still don\u2019t think the police get it. That was our purpose in writing this book \u2013 we wanted to expose the institutional sexism that allowed these relationships to happen and to stop more women being abused by officers. It\u2019s very easy for an individual\u2019s experience to be written off as a glitch, or just the responsibility of an individual officer, but the strength of us writing our story together \u2013 you start to see patterns, and it is the patterns that demonstrate that this was a systemic problem,\u201d she says.\\nEven people who think they are familiar with the broad outlines of the undercover cop scandal will be astonished by the contents of Deep Deception. The book weaves together the women\u2019s experiences chronologically, revealing in horrifying detail how they were each tricked into relationships.\\nOne of the women lived for five years with a man with whom she hoped to have children, before he disappeared unexpectedly and without trace; it turned out he had been married with three young children throughout the time they had been together. Another had a relationship stretching more than seven years, while another from their group had two children with an officer, believing that he had genuine feelings for her. \u201cThe betrayal and the Orwellian surveillance behind it have devastated lives,\u201d the introduction notes. But the book is a triumphant exercise in exploding the women\u2019s status as victims; it goes on to describe their success in subsequently exposing the cynical and sordid full extent of the spy cops operation.\\nSteel is not sure whether she was selected randomly as a way of giving Dines credibility within the activist community, or if she was targeted because of her involvement in the McDonald\u2019s campaign. Shortly after they began their relationship in the early 90s, she was walking with Dines back to his flat when she was served with a libel writ by McDonald\u2019s over a leaflet she had helped produce highlighting the environmental damage caused by the burger chain; she now believes he must have been involved in helping organise for the writ to be served.\\nThe case would become the longest-running legal battle in English history. Steel and her co-defendant, Dave Morris (an unemployed postal worker), became famous globally for their dogged refusal to apologise in the face of McDonald\u2019s multimillion-pound lawsuit. As Steel prepared her defence, Dines would obligingly pick her up from meetings with the young lawyer who was helping her \u2013 a newly qualified Keir Starmer \u2013 enabling him to hear all about the defence arguments as he drove her home. Later it would emerge that another undercover officer from the same SDS unit had helped draft the offending leaflet.\\n\u201cThey targeted anyone with a desire to protest against the status quo, anyone attempting to hold the government or big business to account. Only a handful of far-right groups were infiltrated among the many hundreds of leftwing ones,\u201d she says. \u201cA large part of their function seemed to be to protect corporate interests.\u201d\n This riveting book exposes repeat patterns of abusive behaviour by the undercover cops, revealing how the men used well-honed strategies for building up relationships and jettisoning them at the end of the deployment. The officers were adept at a method known as \u201cmirroring\u201d: subtly latching on to things the women were interested in and later declaring that they, too, shared those same passions \u2013 the same music, politics, books, commitment to vegetarianism. It becomes clear that they were passing on tips and guidance to each other on how to manipulate the women they were using to provide a front for their undercover work.\\nThe undercover officers had vans and flexible work that made them available for transporting people to and from activist meetings \u2013 allowing them to eavesdrop on plans. The freelance nature of their pretend jobs (as gardeners, carpenters or delivery drivers) also permitted them to disappear for protracted stretches to spend time with their real families.\\nThey exited suddenly, after announcing they were having breakdowns and needed space; they disappeared to South Africa or the US and appeared to be untraceable. The women were devastated at the abrupt end of relationships, upset for themselves, but also worried about the welfare of the defenceless, lonely men they had loved.\\nSteel\u2019s story has been written about previously (not least in the excellent Undercover, by the Guardian journalists Rob Evans and Paul Lewis), but the extent to which her life was messed up by the decision of Dines to dupe her into a relationship is laid bare in this book. It is a shocking and at times painful-to-read series of dizzying, life-shattering deceptions. For a while, Steel had some residual affection for Dines; it was hard to believe that there had been nothing genuine in his behaviour towards her over the two years they had lived together. Subsequently, she has met more than two dozen other women similarly abused and her gaze has hardened.\\nThe Met continues to insist that these relationships were unsanctioned misdemeanours committed by individual rogue officers, but Steel believes this is nonsense. \u201cWe could see that what had seemed like heart-wrenching stories told by the officers at the time were so similar they could only have come through shared practice. It was chilling,\u201d she says.\\nFour of the women behind the book have chosen to remain anonymous, but Steel long ago abandoned any attempt to box off this chunk of her life. She writes with powerful rage about the women\u2019s continuing battle for justice. \u201cWe were often portrayed as victims with no agency and we wanted to show that it was our detective work that uncovered this scandal, and to show that fighting back against those abuses was an empowering experience,\u201d she says.\n  Although there have been public apologies and financial settlements for some of the women, the book highlights how energetically the police continues to obstruct the women\u2019s campaign to get answers. In a post #MeToo era, at a time when the Met is facing the fallout from its handling of Sarah Everard\u2019s death, it seems remarkable that the force is resisting these women\u2019s requests for disclosure about the details of their cases, by refusing to release the files on them.\\n\u201cThese are akin to Stasi files. All kinds of information was put down in these police files. It is grossly intrusive. There\u2019s no justification in a democracy for keeping those kinds of files,\u201d Steel says.\\nIt is particularly startling to register how consistently the women\u2019s experiences have been trivialised in the years since they exposed the unit\u2019s actions. A judge hearing their case in 2013 described the police officers as \u201ccads\u201d. Another judge, Mr Justice Tugendhat, hearing a different part of the case that year, made a peculiar reference to James Bond to provide context for the behaviour of the police, arguing that the fictional spy\u2019s behaviour showed how the intelligence services had for years used \u201cofficers to form personal relationships of an intimate sexual nature \u2026 in order to obtain information or access\u201d. The women were treated dismissively during a home affairs select committee hearing.\\nWriting in the Daily Mail in 2014, Richard Littlejohn derided the women as \u201can assortment of unwashed dopey birds who slept with undercover officers\u201d. Most significantly, an attempt to prosecute the officers for rape and sexual assault failed in 2014, when the Crown Prosecution Service concluded that there was \u201cinsufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction\u201d.\\nThe CPS decision not to prosecute the officers was \u201cabsolutely outrageous; totally sexist,\u201d Steel says. \u201cThere is no way that we would have consented to these relationships had we known who these men really were and what their purpose was in our lives.\u201d The deception made the women think they were going mad; most were later diagnosed with serious psychological injuries including post-traumatic stress, extreme anxiety, depression and panic attacks.\\nSteel discovered in 1994, through impressive, forensic investigation, that Dines, whom she knew as John Barker, had stolen the identity of a child who had died at eight of leukaemia; some time later, she realised that he was a member of the SDS. Writing the book meant she had to go through diaries and letters from the time of the relationship; she was shocked by how unkind he had been in his treatment of her, particularly the manner of his departure, when he left her and returned repeatedly over several months, telling her he loved her and feeding her new lies about his grief for his fictitiously dead parents. Rereading the letters \u201creally struck home just how abusive and manipulative he was. And that made me really angry; it was as if he set out to destroy my sanity.\u201d\\nDines, who later moved to Australia, has never explained his behaviour. Steel managed to track him down in 2016 and speak to him at Sydney airport (the mobile phone footage of that brief meeting is worth watching, as a fleeting insight into Dines\u2019 callous dismissal of what he has done).\\n\u201cAs far as we know, not a single one of them has faced any consequences for their actions, not even the docking of their pensions,\u201d she says. The impact on the women, however, has been profound. Steel\u2019s faith in her judgment was shattered, so it took a long time before she was able to have another relationship, which meant by the time she started trying to have a family it was difficult. She had seven miscarriages and was ultimately unable to have children.\\n\u201cIt has severely affected our ability to trust other people, or to form intimate relationships again. You can\u2019t compensate for that,\u201d she says, noting that even the state compensation system does not see the world from a woman\u2019s perspective, being more inclined to focus on loss of earnings.\\nShe is unimpressed by the effusive police apology issued in 2015, which she thinks does not sit well with the persistent refusal to release the women\u2019s files so that they can properly understand why they were targeted and the nature of the information held on them. \u201cThere is a tension between them claiming it should never have happened and saying they think it\u2019s appalling, and refusing to tell us the truth about the extent of it and who knew,\u201d she says.\\nIn response to the book, the Met reiterated its regret, stating: \u201cUndercover policing has changed significantly with independent judicial oversight of all operations, and past events highlighted in this book in no way reflect modern-day undercover policing. We recognise the hurt and distress caused to the authors of this book. The actions of undercover officers who deceived these women into sexual relationships were totally unacceptable.\u201d\\nA public inquiry into undercover policing has been running since 2015, but progress has been severely hampered by police requests for secrecy. The hearings restarted this week, however the sessions relating to the women\u2019s experiences are not expected to begin until next year.\\n\u201cThe public inquiry has been bending over backwards to protect the privacy and feelings of the former undercover officers. There is no concern for our privacy and our right to know,\u201d Steel says. \u201cWe all want answers. If the police want to raid someone\u2019s house, they have to apply for a warrant and they have to set out the reasons why they need to search the house. But with these relationships, no warrants needed to be applied for. They were living in our houses and they had access to everything we had in our homes; they had access to the contents of our heads. They could ask us whatever questions they wanted and we would answer \u2013 believing they were our trusted partners, not an undercover cop trying to get information. It was disgusting and inhumane abuse.\u201d\\nDeep Deception is published by Ebury Spotlight (\u00a320). To support the Guardian and Observer, order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.

Rose had originally asked for Vallance to do a televised briefing of cabinet rather than address a parliament committee, but said he was happy with the outcome.\\nBy the end of his strike, he had lost 17kg and was having difficulty standing, but still protested outside parliament every day.\\n\u201cBefore I started the hunger strike, I thought my odds were, no, they wouldn\u2019t let me die,\u201d Rose said. \u201cBut \u2026 in spite of the warnings being that I had lost a significant percentage of my body weight, that left me in a very high-risk category.\\n\u201cPeople in a state of starvation who lose more than 16% of the body mass encounter rapidly deteriorating health \u2026 and that\u2019s what some health experts were saying: that I was at very high risk.\u201d\\nHands met Rose during his hunger strike and the two corresponded. Rose previously told the Guardian that Hands insisted he could not meet his demand, and had urged him several times to reconsider his protest.\\nGovernment sources told the Guardian at the time that ministers felt they could not give in to Rose\u2019s demand, since to do so would encourage others to take similarly risky actions. Meanwhile, Rose\u2019s supporters feared he could suffer sudden heart failure after starving himself for so long.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting question,\u201d Rose said. \u201cWould they have? Would they have left me there for another week to see what happened? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\\nRose accepted the outcome of his strike was a compromise, but said it was a similar compromise to that accepted by Guillermo Fernandez, the Swiss hunger striker from whom he had taken inspiration.\\n\u201cHe was pressurising the environment minister, all of the pressure was put on her head,\u201d Rose said. \u201cAnd in my case, all of my pressure was put on Greg Hands. And in both cases, they didn\u2019t agree to the demand, and in both cases there was an alternate solution.\\n\u201cMy goal was to get the briefing by whatever means, although the way I saw it up until it was secured, I wasn\u2019t going to back down until Greg agreed to the demand.\\n\u201cOver the 37 days there was only less than half an hour when I sat back and contemplated and reflected on the enormity of the situation ahead of me, and that wasn\u2019t fun.\\n\u201cThe way I tried to handle that was just on a day-to-day basis, and over the last 10 days or so, in particular, I got quite a bit weaker, and it started impacting my thinking, my memory. But I was still just doing one day at a time, and I wasn\u2019t going to stop until my demand was met.\\n\u201cYes, it is, I suppose, a bit of a compromise. But I couldn\u2019t say no to the briefing [that] has been secured.\u201d\\nRose said he felt the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the public he met in his five weeks standing outside parliament supported his aims. He also had a team of about 40 people supporting him, lobbying press and politicians, and orchestrating letters from scientists and medics backing his demand.\\nTowards the end, many were encouraging him to back down. But not all. \u201cI had a friend who was prepared to bring me from hospital in a wheelchair back to be in front of the houses of parliament if I collapsed,\u201d Rose said.\\n\u201cAnd I was like, wow, I really didn\u2019t expect that. I didn\u2019t expect [that] because it\u2019s so extreme, you know? Who would have been prepared to do that?\u201d\\nRose is part of a growing wave of climate hunger strikers. As well as Fernandez, last year a group of youths staged a shorter hunger strike outside the White House in the US; in the UK, climate activist Emma Smart refused food when she was jailed for protesting with Insulate Britain; Rose himself joined climate hunger strikers in 2019 in the aftermath of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s protests.\\nRose said the growing numbers of climate hunger strikers, and the self-immolation of Wynn Bruce in Washington last month, were part of a \u201crising tide\u201d of increasingly desperate activism.\\n\u201cPeople will be taking increasingly desperate measures because the government\u2019s actions and its policies aren\u2019t consistent with maintaining a habitable planet on which to live,\u201d Rose said.\n \u201cThis country is currently aiming for world that is two and a half to three degrees warmer.

Even so, Emilie Pine\u2019s bestselling Notes to Self stood out. Initially released by a small, independent Irish press before being scooped up by Hamish Hamilton, the Dublin academic\u2019s mainstream debut brought unusual clarity and compassion to bear on sources of resonant personal pain including miscarriage, rape and life as the daughter of an alcoholic father.\\nShe follows it now with a first novel, Ruth & Pen, which taps that same likable combination of benevolence and searing inquiry as it sets the stories of its two title characters dancing around each other, drawing into their orbit questions of sexuality, self-worth and neurodiversity, as well as themes from the essays.\\nRuth is a 43-year-old therapist. With her marriage buckling beneath the weight of repeated IVF cycles, she suspects husband Aidan is about to leave her, and though her days are spent helping others parse their deepest responses, she\u2019s yet to properly acknowledge the extent to which she feels \u201cviolated\u201d by all that her body has endured in pursuit of a family.\\nMeanwhile, 16-year-old Pen is on the spectrum, still adjusting to her parents\u2019 divorce and trying to summon the courage to ask her best friend, Alice, out on a date. She has her own recent trauma to contend with, and is increasingly preoccupied by the climate emergency. Her overriding ambition is to be \u201cnormal\u201d.\\nThe novel is set over the course of a single October day, during which its Dublin backdrop will host an Extinction Rebellion protest. It won\u2019t be an ordinary day for either protagonist, and by nightfall, both will have faced up to their most anguished fears.\\nDespite being separated by just two degrees, Ruth and Pen are unknown to each other. Their paths cross tantalisingly midway through the novel but what really binds them are their preoccupations \u2013 anxieties about their bodies and their value, about language and its limitations. Though decades apart in age, both are awakening to an urgent need to cut their own paths through the tangled terrain of love and desire.\\nThere is much to admire here. Crucially, in giving Pen a complex internal life that\u2019s set on an equal footing with Ruth\u2019s, Pine sidesteps many of the cliches that attend the representation of autistic characters in literature and film. \u201cYou can\u2019t be autistic and average at the same time, you have to be gifted and interesting,\u201d Pen observes, thereby demonstrating that she is at least incredibly shrewd. But if her viewpoint enables her to spot universal truths likely to elude the more neurotypical, she\u2019s also just a teenage girl coming of age in uncertain times.\\nIt may not sound like it, but joy is a vital ingredient in Ruth & Pen. Sometimes, accessing it requires thinking back to the past or imagining a fanciful future; more often it\u2019s to be found in life\u2019s small, everyday details \u2013 a serendipitous painting or a pleasing idiom, a train pulling in to the platform so that the carriage door is exactly in front of you.\\nThese act as necessary reminders to Pine\u2019s characters \u2013 one just making her way into womanhood, the other on the brink of middle age \u2013 not to abandon their own desires, however messy or conflicted they appear.

Tonight we have had a very strong message from our heartland that we are not representing them.\u201d\\nAnother teal independent, Sophie Scamps, was likely to defeat Jason Falinski in Mackellar with about 53% of the two-candidate vote.\\nIn the Western Australian seat of Curtin, independent candidate Kate Chaney has run a strong challenge against Liberal MP Celia Hammond.

The safety consultant was watching a video of Extinction Rebellion climate protesters who had glued themselves inside Shell\u2019s headquarters in April and were encouraging employees to jump ship to aid its cause.\\nThis week Dennett, who runs the independent agency Clout, released a bombshell video severing ties with Shell after an 11-year business relationship. She emailed 1,400 Shell employees and accused the \u00a3177bn behemoth of causing \u201cextreme harms\u201d to the environment and having a \u201cdisregard for climate change risks\u201d.\\nShe believes Shell is failing to wind down its polluting fossil fuels business and urged its employees to \u201cwalk away while there\u2019s still time\u201d. She acknowledged that she was \u201cprivileged\u201d in being able to make the choice to cut ties.\\nSpeaking to the Guardian, she says support for her decision has flooded in from clients and people all over the world. Her cause may have been helped by the fact Shell has made outsized profits from the energy crisis, hitting its public image and fuelling calls for a windfall tax, which has now been introduced.\\nA lone troll told her: \u201cYou have taken the money and now you have run, you princess.\u201d\\nDennett\u2019s mic drop video was the culmination of a growing sense of unease in working with the 115-year-old company. Her relationship with Shell began in the aftermath of BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon disaster as the industry scrambled to tighten up safety procedures.\\nShe studied the lessons from the Gulf of Mexico, and other tragedies, including poor handovers and pressure to take shortcuts. Clout then designed a bespoke survey for frontline workers, managers and contractors. Since then, her work has taken her to an old gas plant at Jumping Pound in Alberta, Canada, and to Qatar and Trinidad. Her in-depth studies question employees on safety processes, their training, resources and whether managers trust them to be given responsibility. She has completed several such large studies for Shell, as well as other clients in oil and gas and unconnected industries.\\nAt the same time, Dennett had become increasingly engaged in climate activism. She has spent time addressing councils and schools around Dorset \u2013 she lives in Weymouth \u2013 leading debates and encouraging local action, such as installing solar panels on village halls.\\n\u201cI\u2019d find myself asking councils to take their money out of fossil fuels but then admitting I work in the industry and need to do this myself. We\u2019re all hypocrites to some extent but this was starting to feel ridiculous,\u201d she says.\\n\u201cWhat\u2019s clear from working with the frontline employees at Shell is that net zero is just not talked about internally. It simply never comes up where issues like safety and tensions with local communities do,\u201d she says.\\nBut is it fair to expect an oil-rig worker to be engaged in their employer\u2019s overarching corporate strategy? \u201cYes. If it was embedded in the company you would be hearing it discussed all the time. They are experts in managing risk but are not managing the climate risk,\u201d she says.\\nThe strength of feeling about Shell\u2019s impact on the environment was underscored the day after Dennett\u2019s video was released. At the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting at Methodist Central Hall in London, Extinction Rebellion protesters banged drums and shouted: \u201cShell must fall\u201d as people filed in.\\nInside, protesters delayed the meeting by nearly three hours by shouting, and singing \u201cwe will stop you\u201d to the tune of Queen\u2019s 1977 hit We Will Rock You. The executive team sat still, stony faced, watching on while the chairman, Sir Andrew Mackenzie, tried to placate the protesters. \u201cIt was amazing. Singing at the board, you can\u2019t get any more non-violent direct action than that,\u201d Dennett says.\\nHer decision to snub Shell comes at a price \u2013 \u201caround 60%-70% of my business\u201d, she admits. There\u2019s also the possibility of legal action from Shell.\\nIt\u2019s a business she built after an unlikely journey. She was born in Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales; her father fitted industrial piping and her mother worked in a leisure centre. After studying criminal justice and later marketing, she worked in social services, including a psychiatric hospital. Six years in the Netherlands followed, working first for a nascent satnav developer and then for the camera company Canon. She then worked for research agencies before setting up Clout.\\nSo what would be the dream reaction to her very public display of dissent? \u201cThat Shell would wake up and use all of the skill, capital, the human power to genuinely transition. They were a pioneering company that had a vision. They do not have a vision now. It\u2019s a take take take vision. All they can think of is to continue what they have been doing. To the executives, I say: take a look at yourself in the mirror.\u201d\\nShell said more than 75% of the \u00a320bn to \u00a325bn it intends to spend in the UK over the next decade is in low and zero carbon products and services. The company said: \u201cWe expect our energy transition spend to constitute 50% of our total spend by 2025.\u201d", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14eca33a526b923d01ba4b3a8f4f086b62bdff86/0_2_1458_875/master/1458.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Caroline Dennett at a protest against fossil fuels"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05a8a35832012768940ff68da7ec7c8b4a18f1df/0_131_5431_3259/master/5431.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "A masked Extinction Rebellion activist at Methodist Central Hall"]], "author": ["Alex Lawson"], "date": null}, "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/23/shell-consultant-quits-environment-caroline-dennett": {"title": "Shell consultant quits, accusing firm of \u2018extreme harms\u2019 to environment", "subtitle": null, "text": "Caroline Dennett tells staff in video she made decision because of \u2018double-talk on climate\u2019\\nA senior safety consultant has quit working with Shell after 11 years, accusing the fossil fuel producer in a bombshell public video of causing \u201cextreme harms\u201d to the environment.\\nCaroline Dennett claimed Shell had a \u201cdisregard for climate change risks\u201d and urged others in the oil and gas industry to \u201cwalk away while there\u2019s still time\u201d.\\nThe executive, who works for the independent agency Clout, ended her working relationship with Shell in an open letter to its executives and 1,400 employees.

In each interaction we have, she believed, some trace of who we are is left behind; and so to know someone, \u201cone must seek out the people who completed them; even the places\u201d. Perhaps we should consider their encounters with culture, too: which aspects of themselves they find (and therefore we find) within works of art, music, literature.\\nPen, the teenage protagonist of Emilie Pine\u2019s debut novel, Ruth & Pen, describes Mrs Dalloway this way: \u201cWhen she\u2019d read that book by Virginia Woolf last summer, about the man with shell shock, Pen had understood why he had jumped from the window, and she had also understood how hard it was for his wife, who could not help him.\u201d What Pen takes from Woolf\u2019s fourth novel is equally instructive about her own character: the fact that she alights on Septimus Warren Smith, the traumatised first world war veteran, as the text\u2019s fulcral figure. In Septimus\u2019s sensitivity and vulnerability, Pen sees something of herself. School can be challenging for a young person with autism: she has few friends, and requires regular timeouts from class to cope with the sensory shock that each day presents.\\nPen\u2019s summation of Mrs Dalloway also offers a key to her compassionate worldview: she can feel Septimus\u2019s pain and that of his wife at once; she can admit her own unhappiness and simultaneously recognise the ways that sadness hurts her mother, too. Throughout Ruth & Pen, opposing statements are bonded together: \u201cIt\u2019s too late. It\u2019s not too late\u201d; \u201cRun! Stay!\u201d \u201cThe truth is: No. The truth is: Yes.\u201d The title itself, with its prominent ampersand, is indicative of this balancing act of positions that the novel strives towards.\\nAs in Mrs Dalloway, there are two figures around which the action orbits, and the story takes place over the course of a day \u2013 7 October 2019 in Dublin. For the first few chapters the narrative reliably alternates between Pen and Ruth by means of a close third-person. They cross paths twice, both times briefly, at an Extinction Rebellion protest in Merrion Square, where much of Pen\u2019s storyline takes place. She is there to meet the girl she is in love with, Alice; she plans to disclose her true feelings, finally, after the protest. The chapters focusing on Pen are beautifully managed, taking seriously the experiences of a young person with autism.\\nRuth is a therapist in her 30s. On 7 October she wakes up alone. Her husband, Aidan, is away on a work trip, and she feels apprehensive about his return in the evening. For a long time, they have been locked into the same fight. For Ruth, three cycles of IVF \u2013 all those churning hormones, spikes of hope and deep valleys of disappointment \u2013 have put considerable strain on their relationship. With each failed cycle, Ruth feels she and Aidan are \u201closing more of ourselves\u201d. In her view, they have reached a blind alley: she cannot go on like this and he can only see her refusal as a giving up on any potential future between them. \n  Ruth\u2019s storyline is an extension and reworking of an excellent essay in Pine\u2019s acclaimed 2018 collection, Notes to Self. From the Baby Years draws on her and her partner\u2019s attempts to conceive, ending with their decision to forgo IVF and stop \u201ctrying\u201d (a phrase Pine comes to hate). The voice in Notes to Self has a brilliant force to it, like the intrusive beam of a searchlight, revealing in stark detail all aspects of Pine\u2019s various, deeply personal subjects. In Ruth & Pen the intensity of feeling is diluted, not just by the third-person perspective, but by the introduction of further voices as the story progresses. Aidan, Alice and Pen\u2019s mother, Claire, all get their own chapters. And they, like Ruth and Pen, are decent, well-intentioned people. While this ensures that Ruth & Pen develops into a gentle, empathetic novel, the sharpness of thought that is so propulsive in Notes to Self is missing.\\nIn a 1923 diary entry, Woolf wrote of her intentions for Mrs Dalloway: \u201cI want to give life & death, sanity & insanity; I want to criticise the social system, & to show it at work, at its most intense.\u201d Woolf\u2019s novel is charged because of these conflicting elements, which are held in tension by means of two primary characters that exist as dark doubles for each other. There is not enough friction, not enough pressure between the protagonists of Ruth & Pen; its coordinative, paratactic style of \u201cboth/and\u201d is the final limitation to its success.\\nRuth & Pen by Emilie Pine is published by Hamish Hamilton (\u00a314.99).

Fixated on creating a system that detained and quickly removed asylum seekers, the home secretary would have been shocked to discover that some officials in her department were now enthusing about a \u201chumane\u201d alternative.\\nAt precisely the same time as the Home Office was secretly drawing up options for new immigration removal centres, civil servants elsewhere in the department were championing an option that may have rendered such plans redundant.\\nThe results of a Home Office scheme in Newcastle, the first government-funded alternative to detention, had been unequivocally successful. Supporting women asylum seekers in the community was found to improve their wellbeing at half the cost of detaining them. Vulnerable women who otherwise would have been incarcerated experienced greater stability and better health.\\nStaff involved in the programme were convinced of its merits. \u201cThe Home Office officials who set up the project were really invested in it and felt it worked extremely well as a detention alternative. Sadly, their political masters had less interest,\u201d a source said.\\nDespite approving all the recommendations of the pilot\u2019s evaluation, Patel\u2019s department buried it. When asked why, the Home Office declined to comment.\\nAnother trial funded by the Home Office in Bedford, which helps improve the prospects of undocumented migrants while protecting them from detention, is also said to show extremely positive results. Yet it is due to end in June and the concern is that it too will be ignored. Another three government schemes for alternatives to detention have been cancelled.\\nDuncan McAuley, chief executive of charity Action Foundation, which ran the Newcastle trial, said he was \u201creally disappointed\u201d that alternatives were not being pursued despite evidence they were a viable solution.\\nLast week his outlook darkened further. The passing of the contentious Nationality and Borders Act on Wednesday night, critics warn, raises the prospect of more asylum seekers being detained along with more immigration removal centres to house them.\\nAlready some believe Patel\u2019s headline-grabbing plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda may prove to be a distraction designed to deflect scrutiny from the rolling out of facilities like that envisaged for a former RAF base at Linton-on-Ouse.\\nAnd an Observer investigation into the proposed immigration facility in north Yorkshire has uncovered disturbing elements that the government seems to have wanted kept secret.\\nBilled as a reception area, it appears that the Home Office is actually planning to detain an undisclosed number of the approximately 1,500 asylum seekers it intends to house there.\\nAn official government fact sheet dated 14 April offers no mention of the potential for individuals to be detained, saying only that asylum seekers will receive a safeguarding call if they are not back by 10pm.\\nBut at a community meeting, caught on a video obtained by Liberty Investigates, the local Tory MP Kevin Hollinrake told residents: \u201cThere are some people on the site where there will be a detention centre element of it and those people won\u2019t be allowed to leave the detention centre.\u201d\\nLater, when approached by the Observer, Hollinrake confirmed that \u201cthey [the Home Office] did mention a detention element to me but didn\u2019t say how many would be in it\u201d. The Home Office responded by saying that \u201cservice users\u201d at the facility \u201cwill not be detained, however they are expected to be on site overnight\u201d.\\nAnother unreported element is the potential involvement of Serco, the outsourcing firm whose staff have been accused of sexual abuse of detainees. Figures from North Yorkshire police and Linton\u2019s parish council have cited the possibility that the site might be run by Serco, a detail also omitted from the government fact sheet.\\nSerco is already contracted to run some of the most controversial immigration removal centres like Brook House outside Gatwick airport where independent observers have recorded a surge in incidents of self-harm and suicide attempts. Serco and the Home Office chose not to comment.\\nThe possibility of a detention facility run by a firm with such a controversial record is already causing concern. Lottie Hume, a solicitor at Duncan Lewis, said: \u201cThe only reason to have a hybrid detention-accommodation facility is for the Home Office to effect removal at a rate which will erode due process and restrict ability to seek help from others.\u201d\\nAgnes Tonah knows only too well the impact of detention. Ten years after being held in Serco\u2019s notorious Yarl\u2019s Wood immigration centre in Bedford, the experience continues to haunt her. During Tonah\u2019s 90-day incarceration after fleeing war in west Africa, she says her mental health suffered profoundly. She knew another young woman who tried to kill herself because they \u201ccouldn\u2019t understand\u201d why they were effectively jailed.\\n\u201cDetention is a prison. It is a traumatising place where people seeking sanctuary find themselves locked up.\u201d\\nTonah finds it bewildering that the UK government has opted for what she describes as a policy of cruelty. \u201cWhy imprison me when I was just asking for safety? Detention harms people.\u201d\\nThe passing of the Borders Act promises fresh harm. It is understood the government has an undisclosed list of other potential sites for immigration centres, while a new facility just for women recently opened.\\nCritics of the new facility at Derwentside in County Durham say information from inside is difficult to obtain. What is known is that some women allege they have been denied vital in-person legal advice that campaigners say could impair the chance of a successful case, claims that have resulted in a legal challenge. The Home Office responded saying that face-to-face legal visits \u201ccan be facilitated\u201d.\\nThe opening of Derwentside remains a blow to advocates of a progressive asylum system. When it opened its doors after Christmas, the number of women in UK immigration detention stood at a historic low of 24. Within weeks the results of the Newcastle alternative to detention scheme were discussed in the Home Office, then put aside.\\nIt marks a long fall from 2015 when the then home secretary, Theresa May, urged a review that concluded ministers should reduce \u201cboldly and without delay\u201d detention numbers along with a \u201cpresumption against detention\u201d of victims of rape and sexual violence and those suffering post-traumatic stress disorder.\\nA close working relationship was fostered with the United Nations to find a solution to detention, resulting in a Home Office and UNHCR working group on the issue, which first met in October 2017.\\nSuch enlightened ambitions have been flattened by Patel. Celebrating the passing of its divisive bill on Thursday, the Home Office confirmed a key focus was \u201cthe removal of those with no right to be in the UK\u201d.\\nMcAuley said: \u201cAs the passing of the bill clearly indicates, this government is clearly committed to a more costly, less effective and inhumane approach to immigration management.\u201d\\nIn Linton-on-Ouse, locals fear life may never be the same. There is talk of resorting to extreme tactics like those used by Extinction Rebellion activists, such as gluing themselves to fences and roads.\\n\u201cRight now, nothing\u2019s off the table. People are becoming quite desperate,\u201d said Marc Goddard, a parish councillor. He likens the plans to the flooding of another north Yorkshire village, West End, which was submerged in the 1960s to make way for a reservoir supplying Leeds with drinking water.\\n\u201cIt feels like that\u2019s what\u2019s happening to this village. We\u2019re collateral damage, sacrificed, to simply quench the inadequacies of a truly incompetent Home Office,\u201d said Goddard.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c2aaf69c8879c3758dc1a39321cd80d359f1470/0_322_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Marc Goddard, a parish councillor at Linton-on-Ouse, outside the entrance to the former RAF base"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/408705f6da37018cdb98b2ab8cd288a905f3250f/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "MoD housing stock used by the families at the former RAF base."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49632286d1f1fabffe051dd6d6f7c64933c52889/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "The town\u2019s disused RAF base is to be converted to housing for asylum seekers, but details are emerging of plans to detain some of them there."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a18a962703d01b068c2b6332630e425c686c2867/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Jackie Holder lives near the proposed facility, which residents have vowed to block."]], "author": ["Mark Townsend", "Aaron Walawalkar"], "date": "2022-05-01"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/28/the-perfect-golden-circle-by-benjamin-myers-review-rollicking-crop-circle-folk-tale": {"title": "The Perfect Golden Circle by Benjamin Myers review \u2013 rollicking crop-circle folk tale", "subtitle": null, "text": "A spirited and anarchic novel about 80s outsiders on a quest to bring magic to the landscape\\n\u201cWithout fields \u2013 no us. Without us \u2013 no fields,\u201d wrote the great nature writer Tim Dee in his 2013 book Four Fields. He had a caveat: \u201cThese acres of shaped growing earth, telling our shared story over and over, are so ordinary, ubiquitous and banal that we have \u2013 mostly \u2013 stopped noticing them as anything other than substrate or backdrop, the green crayon-lane across the bottom of every child\u2019s drawing.\u201d\\nIt\u2019s this myopia that Benjamin Myers explores in his roiling, rollicking novel The Perfect Golden Circle, set during the long hot summer of 1989. Thatcher, apartheid, the Berlin Wall: things seemed solid then. In the West Country, though, history was being made at night; farmers were waking up to discover their wheat fields decorated with crop circles and other mysterious radials. Was it the work of extraterrestrials, or proto Banksys?\\nIn Myers\u2019s telling, the men responsible were no vandals. Redbone and Calvert are an odd couple; their names may suggest a Savile Row shirtmaker, but the pair are closer in spirit to centrifugal visionaries such as the KLF. Redbone is younger, has travelled Europe with various bands, and is popular with women; Calvert is taciturn, always wears sunglasses, and has PTSD after serving in the SAS during the Falklands war. For weeks on end, living in a battered camper van, they move through the English countryside. Their goals: to create ever more dazzling patterns, to stay anonymous, to not get caught.\\nThe fields are rarely quiet at night. Redbone and Calvert encounter \u201clampers\u201d, driving around in open-top jeeps shining spotlights at badgers and hares before setting dogs on them. They come across people having sex in laybys; fly-tippers; Gypsy prizefighters; a ghostly old woman who says she has been searching for her missing dog, Sebastian, most nights since 1909; a pissed aristocrat who turns out to be the son of the third richest landowner in the country.\\nThe days, too, are far from bucolic. The country lanes teem with rogues, quacks, chancers. The crop circles draw Fleet Street stringers, ufologists, a demonic exorcist, a disgraced psychic and a retired physicist explaining to passersby that they are \u201ccreated by an electro-magnetic-hydrodynamic plasma vortex\u201d. There\u2019s also a grand wizard from Cornwall, \u201ca new age a cappella vocal group improvising a work that will later feature on their album Lapsed Eden/Visions of Gaia, several leading Greenpeace activists ... four police officers, half a dozen dogs and Brian Eno\u201d.\\nThe novel begins portentously. The narrative invokes wolves stalking shrinking copses and fields that are full of bones, \u201crotting deep in the rich soil of a singular cemetery called England\u201d. Throughout, there are echoes of David Peace, Gordon Burn, Stephen Barber \u2013 writers who render the recent past as occulture, hallucinatory. There are also spectres of other more politically fraught fields from the 80s: Goose Green, Orgreave, the Battle of the Beanfield near Stonehenge.\\nBut a steady flow of banter lightens the mood. Redbone describes his new musical direction as \u201cGrindcore shit, but with a strong acid house influence\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019re not doing rural West Country reggae any more, then?\u201d replies Calvert. It\u2019s easy to imagine Myers giggling as he came up with the names of some of the circles: Throstle Henge Asteroid Necklace and Bracklebury Dodman could be Aphex Twin tracks.\\nMyers isn\u2019t an ironist. What\u2019s most striking about The Perfect Golden Circle is the way it depicts time \u2013 its thickness, mysteries, continuities, the way it ebbs and flows. Redbone knows that \u201cthere exists an under-England, a chthonic place\u201d in which there are \u201cso many secrets that go beyond the limitations of the here and now\u201d. He and his pal have epiphanies about belonging to a lineage of people who, across millennia, have been magicked by the fields. A cuckoo song is \u201ca call down the centuries ... a canticle for the warming land\u201d. That summer it never rains. The wheat fields \u201cwhisper their desperate thirst\u201d. Calvert, a glum Tiresias, foresees new viruses, broken food chains.\\nDee argued that fields show \u201chow we live both within the grain of the world and against it\u201d. Those trespassed by Redbone and Calvert serve to hex that persistent strain of English pastoralism that dotes on baronial piles and manicured landscapes. They embody a counter-tradition: the pagan, anarchistic ruralism so vividly channelled in Jez Butterworth\u2019s Jerusalem, or David Rudkin\u2019s Penda\u2019s Fen, or by rogue art groups such as English Heretic and Folklore Tapes.\\nFor Redbone and Calvert, England \u201cis a kingdom that belongs entirely to the dreaming dissenters and the rat-tailed revolutionaries, and is open to all comers. All borders and boundaries, whether visible or not, are only there for the burning.\u201d The Perfect Golden Circle makes these eccentric outsiders seem like seditionaries in arcadia, contemporary folk heroes.\\nThe Perfect Golden Circle is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a316.99).

Vincent\u2019s approach saw climate activism pulling on a business suit to sit down in the offices, boardrooms and shareholder meetings of financial institutions.\\nToday Vincent is awarded the prestigious Goldman environmental prize, described by some as the \u201cGreen Nobel\u201d.\\nHe is honoured for creating a \u201cchallenging financial landscape for the Australian coal industry, a significant step toward reducing fossil fuels that hasten climate change\u201d.\\nWith that award, Vincent\u2019s work stands alongside previous winners that were at the centre of some of Australia\u2019s most famous environmental battles \u2013 from saving the Franklin River to blocking uranium mining.\\nGrowing up in the Melbourne suburb of St Kilda, Vincent was no more interested in the environment than most young people. A pivotal moment came when he went to Monash University to do a degree in atmospheric science.\\n\u201cI wanted to be weatherman,\u201d he says. But among the lecturers on his course was Prof David Karoly \u2013 a veteran of Australian climate science. What Karoly and other lecturers outlined to the student Vincent was pivotal.\\n\u201cI was being confronted with all these charts and it was like I was in on a terrible secret that these scientists were desperately trying to get out.\\n\u201cI could see those charts and their profound consequences. It was off the scale. I was all in by the time I\u2019d finished those first couple of climate science lectures.\u201d\\nVincent finished his degree with honours in arts and climatology, but didn\u2019t know what to do with it. He had some savings from working in a bottle shop.\\nHe quit, paid off the lease on his Melbourne flat and took a few volunteer roles and, crucially, a four-month internship at Greenpeace which turned into a job as a campaigner. \u201cI had no money, but I had time,\u201d he says.\\nIn 2012, while working at Greenpeace, Vincent was part of a campaign that blocked a new coal power station being built at Morwell.\\nThat campaign, Vincent says, was successful because it targeted the legitimacy of the project\u2019s income stream \u2013 in that case, federal and state government grants.\\n\u201cI was starting to win campaigns by going after the money. I thought: why isn\u2019t there a group in Australia that\u2019s focused on that day in, day out?\u201d\\nSo, armed with that second-hand laptop, Vincent researched who was financing coal projects and tallied up the billions being spent by Australia\u2019s big four banks \u2013 Commonwealth, NAB, ANZ and Westpac.\\nHe named his venture Market Forces. Slowly adding to the original one-man band, Market Forces would publish their results, organise public protests and \u201cdivestment days\u201d where customers would close accounts at banks that backed coal.\\nAt the same time, Vincent says his campaign meets the financial institutions \u2013 from chief executives to managers \u2013 to outline their campaign plans.\\nBlair Palese, a long-term climate campaigner who founded the group 350.org in Australia, worked alongside Vincent in some of those early campaigns.\\n\u201cJulien is an Everest climber,\u201d she says. \u201cHe is a very determined and focused human being. We had a great time doing very hard stuff.\u201d\\nShe says while many environmental campaigns will have a short lifespan, Vincent and Market Forces stuck to the task. It meant the financial institutions he was meeting and campaigning against \u201cknow he\u2019s going to turn up next month to check on them\u201d.\\n\u201cJulien holds them accountable every day,\u201d Palese says.\\nA 2019 pledge from the Commonwealth bank to stop funding thermal coal by 2030 was a tipping point for the campaign, Vincent says, with the other three major banks following soon after.\\n\u201cThat was years of campaigning \u2013 we had divestment days, shareholder actions,\u201d he says, as well as a string of meetings with bank bosses.\\n\u201cThe lesson was that you can get to a point of mutual understanding and trust. We were not satisfied with what they were doing, and they didn\u2019t appreciate our campaigning. But we had years of meetings and there was an understanding. It\u2019s about being genuine and sincere.\u201d\\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\\nMarket Forces also published detailed research showing how the banks and superannuation funds used by Australians were supporting fossil fuel projects.\\n\u201cPeople are very powerful,\u201d he says. \u201cThe role of people like me is to create the context and the conditions for them to use that power. They take the information and then do something with it.\u201d\\nAs Market Forces started to gain traction, the attacks started. Vincent says he\u2019s had legal letters from mining companies and many uncomfortable meetings.\\nIn 2019 the former prime minister, Scott Morrison, and then attorney general Christian Porter attacked Vincent\u2019s work, with the latter describing Market Forces as a \u201cradical activist\u201d group that was trying to \u201cimpose their political will on companies across the country through widespread, coordinated harassment and threats of boycotts\u201d. Porter said he would try to explore legal options to curtail the campaigns.\\n\u201cThere\u2019s a correlation between the risk and the discomfort you feel, and the change that you get,\u201d Vincent says. \u201cBut there\u2019s so much of humanity and ecosystems to save and to fight for. What better way is there to be than to try and protect that?\u201d\\nMarket Forces \u2013 now with a staff of more than 20, and bases in Australia, Asia and the UK \u2013 started with a focus on coal and banks, but now targets other financiers and insurers of fossil fuel projects.\\nThe campaign\u2019s core goal is to \u201cstop the expansion of the fossil fuel industry\u201d, Vincent says, \u201cbecause that is the moment we are at. We\u2019re here to stop runaway climate change\u201d.\\nHe is worried that a move to massively expand liquified natural gas \u2013 LNG \u2013 could be just as damaging to the climate as the coal it claims to be replacing. The campaign is funded by about 1,000 regular donors and 10 philanthropic sources.\\nEach year the Goldman prize names a \u201chero of the environment\u201d from six different regions around the world.

Lifestyle factors affect the precise makeup, but broadly this splits into five equal components of about two tonnes of CO2e a year each. There are therefore five highly effective steps of broadly equal weight ranked in order of relative ease as follows:\\n1) Switch to a genuine renewable energy supplier for all electricity and heat requirements. Ideally heat is provided by electricity (via a heat pump) as this also avoids other emissions such as fugitive. Avoids two tonnes of CO2e a year.\\n2) Become vegan. Avoids two tonnes of CO2e a year (assuming avoidance of three portions of meat including one portion of beef a week).\\n3) Stop flying. Avoids two tonnes of CO2e a year (assuming eight flight hours per annum avoided).\\n4) Stop driving an internal-combustion-engined car. Avoids two tonnes of CO2e a year (assuming medium-sized car and 8,000 miles per annum).\\n5) Reduce consumption and waste focusing on clothing, electrical goods, plastic avoidance and food waste avoidance.

Consider genuine offsets.\\nThe 1.5C pathway requires us all to get to within two tonnes of CO2e a year, so there is scope for some emissions and in future goods and services will become less carbon-intensive. Rolf Stein\\nGoing whole-foods plant-based is hands down the No 1 thing you can do. So much is connected to it, that not only do you win, but the whole planet wins. Maplelvr\\nEat the rich. Droff\\nUse the damned emissions that we aren\u2019t about to stop creating! Capture them, sell them as CO2 feedstocks for new products, feed them to microbes, encase them in CarbonCure concrete, feed them to specialised crops in high-CO2 environments.

Changing where your money is invested has very far reaching and real consequences, and can also be done within a matter of minutes. Andy Gale\\nThe single most effective thing you can do to reduce your carbon is avoid having children (not the easiest choice for many). The next most important action is to stop driving a car. If that\u2019s not possible, drive an electric car. If you don\u2019t drive or fly, the next most important action is to install solar or buy green power. If you have already done that, go vegan. Rebecca Blackburn\\nSupport or join a coalition like Just Stop Oil and collectively demand that the UK government stops granting new fossil-fuel licences. If successful, this will be the biggest reduction you will ever make to your carbon footprint. Paul Fawkesley\\nAs was pointed out in Rebecca Solnit\u2019s article last year, the term \u201ccarbon footprint\u201d was invented by PR company Ogilvy and Mather for BP as a means to shift blame for the climate crisis on to individuals and deflect it from the corporations responsible for promoting an economy completely reliant on fossil fuels. The best thing you can do to reduce your carbon footprint is to blockade an oil refinery, protest on the streets, or chain yourself to the gates of parliament and make a big noise about the corrupt and stinking cartel at the centre of our extractive capitalist economy. Just Stop Oil! Hubeth New\\nTo reduce emissions, choosing to have a small family, or forgoing having biological children, is best. If the goal is to mitigate the overall impact of the crisis, on many social and ecological levels. Promoting Fair Start family reforms is the best move. Carter Dillard, University of Denver College of Law\\nThe answer depends on your current lifestyle (mainly energy consumption) and knowing where your emissions are generated. Use a personal carbon footprint calculator to discover this \u2013 carbonfootprint.com is one of the best because it is authoritative and sufficiently detailed to reveal which of your activities has the greatest impact.\\nMy family\u2019s was the national average of approximately 11 tonnes of CO2e in 2006. Being more careful with home heating and cutting out most flying reduced it to eight tonnes the following year. By 2021 the national average had reduced to six tonnes (mainly due to replacing coal with gas-fired electricity plus industry efficiencies) and ours was 3.6 tonnes (two tonnes direct and 1.6 tonnes secondary emissions) helped by a more fuel-efficient, carefully driven car, less mileage, frugal electricity use and being vegetarian. Further significant reductions will require moving car or house heating to 100% renewable electricity, either being very costly. The UK national target set in 2008 is equivalent to five tonnes by 2030 and two tonnes by 2050, so we all have a way to go. We need more ambitious government action but as individuals we can do our bit. Simon Austin\\nIs there one single individual action that will solve the crisis? No. And yet \u2026 can we lead healthier lives where we\u2019re in sync with nature and our local \u2013 and global \u2013 communities? That\u2019s the prize. Greener and cleaner means slower and happier. Dr Noah Birksted-Breen, Oxford Flying Less podcast\\nReduce what you buy (includes reduce, reuse, repair, rent and recycle). Gets rid of the carbon footprint from extracting raw materials, process plants, packaging, transport, storage and disposal. If it\u2019s clothes, it also stops water being diverted from those that need it to cotton fields. Melanie Boyle\\nIt\u2019s easy to looks at the things that are defined \u2013 get an electric car, get a heat pump, go vegan, buy less clothes, stop flying, and so on. All are good advice. But I say also, go little. All the little things we consume add up to one big old mess of wasted production, use, and then rubbish. Garden centres full of plastic tubs and plastic labels and plastic garden decorations, and solar lights using the smallest of microchips, but there are tens of thousands of them out there. Precious metals shipped to China, transformed in a factory, using energy to be joined with pretty plastics decorations, then shipped back around the world and into our gardens because they look oh so cute. Only for then to stop working after a year and go in the bin. Of course we can still have nice pointless things, but let\u2019s have better nice pointless things. Long-lasting, well made, repairable, resellable, made from renewable sources. confused23\\nI no longer shower every day and I don\u2019t think I smell. Saves water and power.

Here are some of the most emotive, arresting and creative images which capture the narrative of another memorable top-flight campaign.\\nThe Premier League season began in explosive style on 13 August as Brentford, celebrating their return to the top flight after a 74-year absence, beat Arsenal 2-0. But the standout result of the opening weekend was Tottenham\u2019s victory over champions Manchester City two days later, courtesy of Son Heung-min\u2019s goal, as Spurs made a beeline for the top of the table. Elsewhere, City\u2019s \u00a3100m man Jack Grealish bundled home his first goal for the club and Michail Antonio celebrated with, err, himself as he lead West Ham\u2019s early-season charge.\\nTwelve years since his last performance for the Red Devils, Cristiano Ronaldo inevitably scored on his return to Manchester United as they swept aside Newcastle. Elsewhere, Tottenham suffered a crushing month with 3-0 defeats to Crystal Palace and Chelsea as well as a 3-1 reverse in the north London derby at Arsenal; Everton\u2019s promising home form under Rafael Ben\u00edtez continued with wins over Norwich and Burnley; and a 95th-minute equaliser by Neal Maupay for Brighton against bitter rivals Palace led to ugly scenes in the tunnel. The world of football also paid tribute to Jimmy Greaves, the former Tottenham, Chelsea, West Ham and England striker, who died aged 81.\\nLiverpool\u2019s Mohamed Salah was the star of October, winning both player of the month and goal of the month. The Egyptian produced a mesmeric strike during a 5-0 drubbing of Watford \u2013 he waltzed between three defenders, Cruyff-turned another and then swept his shot into the far corner. Salah then scored a 12-minute hat-trick against Manchester United, which weakened Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s hold on the manager\u2019s job. Salah also netted against Manchester City at Anfield, in a game which ended 2-2 following Kevin De Bruyne\u2019s deflected 81st-minute strike. Elsewhere, the footballing landscape shifted dramatically as struggling Newcastle suddenly became enormously rich after being controversially taken over by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund \u2013 much to the delight of most Magpies fans.\\nSteven Gerrard took over at Aston Villa following Dean Smith\u2019s departure in the wake of five straight defeats. Ollie Watkins and Tyrone Mings scored in the final six minutes as they dispatched Brighton to hand Gerrard victory in his first match in charge. Elsewhere, Antonio Conte took over from Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo at Spurs, but his first Premier League game at the helm was a 0-0 draw at Everton. The biggest result of the month came when West Ham dented Liverpool\u2019s title aspirations \u2013 and moved above them in the table \u2013 with a 3-2 win at the London Stadium.\\nManchester City hit the afterburners in December, scoring 22 goals and opening up an eight-point gap at the top of the table courtesy of 10 straight wins. Their 7-0 drubbing of Leeds was the high point, but a rollercoaster 6-3 win over Leicester was more memorable as Leicester clawed their way back from 4-0 down to 4-3. Two days later, Brendan Rodgers\u2019 side would defeat Liverpool 1-0 through Ademola Lookman\u2019s goal. Elsewhere, West Ham beat Chelsea as David Moyes, dubbed \u201cthe Moyesiah\u201d, continued to make progress with the Hammers, while Manchester United began life under interim manager Ralf Rangnick.\\nGoals in the 95th and 97th minute from Steven Bergwijn earned Tottenham a miraculous win over Leicester at the King Power Stadium and triggered pandemonium in the stands. Elsewhere, Everton\u2019s patience with Rafael Ben\u00edtez ran out following defeat to Norwich, Newcastle signed Kieran Trippier from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid as they looked to buy their way out of the relegation zone, and when Brentford met Wolves their match was bizarrely interrupted as a drone flew overhead.\\nFebruary was marked by two heartwarming moments. Christian Eriksen returned to professional football for the first time since his cardiac arrest while playing for Denmark at Euro 2020. The midfielder came on as a 52nd-minute substitute for Brentford against Newcastle. On that same day, Ukrainians Oleksandr Zinchenko and Vitalii Mykolenko shared an emotional embrace before the match between Manchester City and Everton following Russia\u2019s invasion of their homeland. Fans and players around the Premier League showed support for their country.\\nA lone \u2018Just Stop Oil\u2019 protestor interrupted the match between Everton and Newcastle by cable-tying himself to a goalpost \u2013 leading to the absurd footage of an overzealous steward using giant bolt cutters to free him. There was another amusing moment at Brentford v Norwich when Brandon Williams lashed out at an opponent, only to realise it was Christian Eriksen. Instead of berating him, Williams smiled and gave him a cuddle. And who could forget the grief West Ham\u2019s Kurt Zouma received after footage emerged of him kicking a cat? Elsewhere, Liverpool closed the gap on leaders Manchester City to a single point, having been 12 points behind on New Year\u2019s Day, courtesy of scintillating performances from Luis D\u00edaz, while Sean Dyche\u2019s Burnley ended the month four points adrift of safety, and Roman Abramovich signalled his intention to sell Chelsea following sanctions imposed by the UK government over the war in Ukraine.\\nTitle rivals Manchester City and Liverpool went into their second clash of the season knowing that victory for either side would give them a critical points advantage with just seven games remaining. As it happened, they shared another 2-2 draw, with City in electric form in the first half. Much to public consternation, Burnley dumped Sean Dyche \u2013 and then they began to win. Elsewhere, Everton dropped into the relegation zone and Brighton, another team whose form had fallen off a cliff, halted a run of six consecutive league defeats, while Norwich\u2019s long anticipated relegation from the top flight was confirmed by defeat at Villa.\\nAs the Premier League season reached its climax, Everton and Leeds scrambled to safety at the expense of Burnley, while Tottenham leapfrogged Arsenal to claim fourth spot. But the biggest drama was shared between the top two sides, Manchester City and Liverpool, as they both looked destined to choke. The title rivals entered the final day separated by just a point, with City knowing that a win over visitors Aston Villa would seal the crown. In scarcely believable scenes, City fell two goals behind to Villa, while Liverpool struggled to overturn a dogged Wolves side at Anfield. Then, in the space of six inspired minutes, Guardiola\u2019s side roared to a 3-2 victory to clinch their fourth title in five years.\\nThis article was amended on 26 May 2022 to replace one of the photographs featured in the \u201cApril\u201d section with a different image taken at the Norwich v Aston Villa match.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5333a7d23a6fa06f58bbc54926fe02408b3f8b08/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=480&dpr=1&s=none", "Tottenham\u2019s Cristian Romero celebrates after Harry Maguire scores an own goal; Everton's Richarlison holds a flare; Manchester City's Jack Grealish with his fingers in his ears; Brighton's Marc Cucurella flails on the floor; Manchester City's Pep Guardiola eyeballs Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold; Newcastle fans wearing middle Eastern attire; a dejected Norwich fan; a banner lauding West Ham manager David Moyes; Wolves' Raul Jimenez tries a rabona."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adf7c97a3561289939392e105b29d90a400377f6/0_0_3874_2325/master/3874.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Christian N\u00f8rgaard of Brentford celebrates after scoring against Arsenal on the first night of the season."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4ec3440aa8436c1fe52b12498f9c4f8b825916f/0_0_2343_1595/master/2343.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Crystal Palace\u2019s Conor Gallagher scores during a 2-2 draw with West Ham"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63e19cdec80aacd2300e2763bcc8458c54e08e49/0_0_5568_3712/master/5568.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Wilfried Zaha of Crystal Palace celebrates his side\u2019s comeback at the London Stadium"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1863580ba33cf014ea2965d58a9b791cd99c1cbd/0_0_3938_2571/master/3938.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Ferran Torres and Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg tussle for the ball during the match between Tottenham and Manchester City at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on the opening weekend."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c9e79887704f3d3aaec99d076817fa5d61cae62/0_0_3846_2564/master/3846.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Mohamed Salah of Liverpool controls the ball against Norwich during a 3-0 win at Carrow Road."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cc05b5f65368a35ae3d5618602496a578113681/0_0_3500_2463/master/3500.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "West Ham United\u2019s Michail Antonio celebrates scoring his side\u2019s third goal against Leicester by raising a cardboard cutout of himself.

Experts say the current mood on gene editing is softer\\nAt the height of the anti-GM movement, in 1999, the then head of Greenpeace UK, Peter Melchett, was charged with theft and criminal damage after scything down a field of genetically modified maize.\\nIn a decisive victory for the anti-GM movement, Lord Melchett and 27 fellow activists were acquitted by a jury in what many took as a measure of the profound negative public sentiment towards GM technology.\\nMore than 20 years on, as the government proposes relaxing regulations on gene-edited products, experts say the public view on the technology has, if not entirely warmed, at least softened.\\n\u201cI think most people now have what I call the Catherine Tait view: \u2018Am I bovvered?\u2019,\u201d said Prof Jonathan Jones of the Sainsbury Laboratory, a plant research institute based in Norfolk.\\nScientists such as Jones welcome the new legislation that could pave the way for a host of technologically enhanced products from vitamin D-enriched tomatoes to anti-carcinogenic wheat. But experts also question whether the technology will really deliver the boost to food security and environmental benefits promised by the government.\\nOne point of contention is the distinction between gene-edited products, which will be permitted, and genetically modified organisms, which will still be subject to strict legislation.\\nNewer gene-editing techniques \u2013 termed \u201cprecision breeding\u201d in the bill \u2013 involve precise changes to single letters of the genetic code. Such changes can be achieved far less efficiently through years of cross-breeding.\\nBut the legislation will not immediately open the way for first generation genetic modification (GM) techniques, which involve taking an entire gene from one plant and inserting it into another.\\nThis concept was behind the unfounded term \u201cFrankenfood\u201d but has also delivered some of the most impressive results, such as a blight-resistant potato, known as piper plus, developed by Jones\u2019s team.\\nThe potato is identical to the maris piper, aside from three genes that make it resistant to late blight, which costs UK farmers tens of millions of pounds annually and requires farmers to spray fields more than a dozen times each year.\\n\u201cI\u2019m a bit uncomfortable with the way this has been presented to the public,\u201d said Jones. \u201cIt comes across as saying \u2018Don\u2019t worry about this nasty GM because we can do what we want with this lovely gene-editing method\u2019. It leaves intact the false impression that there\u2019s anything wrong with GM.\u201d\\nJones said the bill may be a reasonable \u201ctactical compromise\u201d that could pave the way for a further relaxation of GM rules. \u201cAt least I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s what the government is thinking,\u201d he added.\\nThe distinction has also annoyed some environmental campaigners. \u201cGene editing is just a subset of GM,\u201d said Kierra Box from Friends of the Earth. The charity, she said, maintained a \u201cfundamental opposition\u201d to genetic modification because it was not convinced the technology could deliver environmentally friendly solutions. \u201cIf we\u2019re interfering with the genetic codes in nature, we don\u2019t know how those things respond,\u201d she added.\\nHowever, no one is anticipating activists tearing up fields of gene-edited wheat. Greenpeace, once staunchly opposed, does not offer a view on the bill when contacted. \u201cIt\u2019s not one we\u2019ve commented on, we haven\u2019t done much work in the area recently,\u201d a spokesperson replied in an email.\\nAnother concern is that the legislation will apply only to England \u2013 the Scottish and Welsh governments, which have devolved control of such regulations, are opposed to changing the rules. Under current proposals, gene-edited products could only be developed by scientists and farmers in England, but sold throughout the UK, which could exacerbate political tensions and public opposition.\\nComplicated supply chains mean this also poses a \u201cbit of a nightmare\u201d logistically, according to Jones. For instance, a large proportion of the UK\u2019s seed potatoes, which supply potato farms, are grown in Scotland because its colder climate makes them less susceptible to a pathogen called potato virus Y. Jones said his team was looking at whether gene editing could also make potatoes resistant to this virus. \u201cWe might have to GM our way out of it,\u201d he said.\\nThere is also a lingering question of where public opinion really lies.\\nProf Cathie Martin, of the John Innes Centre in Norwich, said the anti-GM movement was, at heart, motivated by concerns about globalisation and that this conversation had moved on. \u201cIt was the way Monsanto tried to introduce GM crops into Europe without consultation and without proper understanding of European agriculture systems,\u201d she said. \u201cSince then we\u2019ve had 9/11, a couple of major wars, the threat of climate change has come into focus. People view risks in different ways.\u201d\\nDr Pete Mills, an assistant director at the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, which is leading a consultation on public attitudes towards genetically modified products, said recent research \u2013 although there has not been much \u2013 suggested that \u201cactually people don\u2019t care very much about the technology\u201d.\\n\u201cWhat they care about is animal welfare, what the purpose is, who the benefits accrue to,\u201d he said. The intention to extend the proposed legislation to cover gene-edited animals at a later date raises particular ethical concerns, Mills said, and may make the term \u201cprecision breeding\u201d feel less reassuring. \u201cThe perception of conventional breeding, especially when it comes to animals, is that this has led to unsustainable outcomes,\u201d he said.\\nScientists such as Jones and Martin have pioneered GM technology to create crops that they argue could have substantial environmental and nutritional benefits. But there are less wholesome counter-examples, such as gene-edited \u201cdouble muscled\u201d pigs \u2013 meatier, but with other health problems.\\n\u201cThe legislation doesn\u2019t really have any thought about the purposes for which these technologies are going to be used,\u201d said Mills. \u201cI think that\u2019s problematic.\u201d", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/340f476cbf0ce196403d5afe2e709a7874d45777/0_15_1652_991/master/1652.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Greenpeace protesters attacking a field of genetically modified crops in Norfolk"]], "author": ["Hannah Devlin"], "date": "2022-05-27"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/28/beekeepers-and-communists-how-environmentalists-started-a-global-conversation": {"title": "Beekeepers and communists: how environmentalists started a global conversation", "subtitle": null, "text": "The world\u2019s longest serving environment correspondent explains the origins of a slow and continuing journey\\nIt all began with H\u00f6gertrafikoml\u00e4ggningen, Swedish for \u201cthe right-hand traffic reorganisation\u201d.\\nOn 3 September 1967, Sweden switched from driving on the left to driving on the right. The change mainly took place at night, but in Stockholm and Malm\u00f6 all traffic stopped for most of the weekend while intersections were reconfigured.\\nSo sweet was the resulting city air that weekend that environmental enthusiasm went sky high. It was a moment that would change the world.\\nThree months later Sweden, citing air and other pollution, asked the UN to hold the first-ever international environmental conference, initiating a process that would lead to a groundbreaking gathering in its capital in 5 June 1972, the 50th anniversary of which will be marked next week. This was the beginning of a long and slow struggle to find and agree global solutions to these newly understood global environment problem. Twenty years later, the Rio conference would follow in the same month, kicking off UN climate summits, the most recent of which was held in Glasgow last autumn.\\nAnd yet critical mistakes were made at this early juncture. Progress, as we know, has been glacial in the years since. Now, looking back at the first steps on that journey, it\u2019s hard not to see that, although in there were so many issues the conference got right, there were also some crucial issues it got wrong.\\nThe Stockholm conference \u2013 held in the city\u2019s Folkets Hus the site of both a former prison and a theatre specialising in farces \u2013 gave green issues international import. In the 1960s, environmental issues had seemed local, not global. In Britain, for example, the last of the great London smogs killed 750 people in 1962, while tragedy struck four years later in Aberfan, Wales, with the collapse of a colliery spoil tip. In Japan, people wore masks against air pollution. There was drought in the Sahel. And in 1969 a passing train ignited oil in Ohio\u2019s Cuyahoga River, setting it ablaze.\\nBut this was also a decade in which there were early stirrings of revolt against the environmental destruction. The World Wildlife Fund launched in 1961 with a special issue of the Daily Mirror carrying the front-page headline \u201cDOOMED\u201d. Rachel Carson\u2019s book Silent Spring savaged pesticides the next year, and in 1969 an undergraduate Prince Charles first entered the fray, lobbying the then British prime minister, Harold Wilson, about Atlantic salmon at an event at the Finnish embassy.\\nBut these were isolated voices, denounced and dismissed by the powerful. Carson, said the US chemical industry, wanted to return to \u201cthe dark ages\u201d where \u201cinsects and vermin would once again inherit the Earth\u201d. The then US agriculture secretary wrote to former US President Dwight Eisenhower, saying that since Carson was unmarried, despite being \u201cattractive\u201d, she was \u201cprobably a communist\u201d.\\nThe plan for an international conference in Stockholm initially had so little support that it was dismissively called \u201cthe Swedish matter\u201d at the UN. It took two years of lobbying, against UK and French opposition, before the general assembly backed the proposal. As it happened, this (January 1970) was when I was told by a far-sighted editor at the Yorkshire Post that we needed to be covering this stuff and my long stint on the environment beat \u2013 the longest in the world as far as I am aware \u2013 began.\\nNow the issue began taking off. The number of Americans concerned about air and water pollution doubled between 1965 and 1970, to 70%. That April, 20 million people demonstrated on the first Earth Day, leaving \u2013 to opponents\u2019 delight \u2013 much litter behind them. Richard Nixon\u2019s environment chief described Washington\u2019s mood as \u201chysteria\u201d, and the then US president devoted a quarter of that year\u2019s State of the Union address to the issue. Over the next three years, he brought in 14 pieces of legislation laying the foundations of environmental US policy and institutions.\\nIn Britain in 1970, Ted Heath came to power and established one of the world\u2019s first environment ministries (originally he wanted to call it the Department for Life until he realised that would make his pushy minister Peter Walker \u201csecretary of state for life\u201d).\\nDeveloping world leaders were becoming worried, fearing wealthy countries would use environmental concern to deny them development. Those worries were not assuaged by the publication of two bestselling books: the Club of Rome\u2019s Limits to Growth (the title says it) and A Blueprint for Survival by 30 top UK scientists, which called for deindustrialisation and extolled tribal societies. Alarmed, some considered boycotting Stockholm, with Brazil calling it \u201ca rich man\u2019s show\u201d, and India and Nigeria also publicly expressing concern.\\nThe books had another effect, erroneously concentrating attention on finite \u201cnon-renewable resources\u201d, like minerals and fossil fuels, which were projected to run out. Limits to Growth had a particularly strong impact, because \u2013 back in those days when computers were thought to be omniscient \u2013 the book\u2019s authors had run a series of models that showed supplies collapsing as economic growth continued, causing \u201crather sudden and uncontrollable decline\u201d in industrial capacity.\\nIts fans were generally far less concerned about \u201crenewable\u201d resources like forests, fisheries and soils, as these would, by definition, replenish themselves. But, in practice, these were already being depleted so fast that they had no chance to recover, and their destruction has been at the heart of most of the big environmental crises of the past half century.\\nMeanwhile, the shortages of minerals never took place at anything like the feared scale \u2013 and we now know that we have more oil, gas and coal than we can burn without ruining the climate.\\nSuch was the background against which the Stockholm conference got under way. In retrospect, far too little attention was paid to climate change \u2013 which was only beginning to arouse concern, despite having been identified as a potential crisis more than 100 years earlier \u2013 and to biodiversity. And, though the conference did come up with 109 recommendations, there would not be another big global summit on the environment for another 20 years.\\nThe conference outcome was uncertain until the last minute. The final issue of its newspaper, Eco, said negotiators could only agree on one thing as the end neared: \u201cEither a declaration will be finalised \u2013 or it will not.\u201d After a non-stop 14-hour session, it was \u2013 together with a 109-point action plan.\\nA rush of international agreements followed \u2013 on marine pollution, endangered species, world heritage, acid rain, whaling, and much else, culminating in one of the most successful treaties of all time, saving the Earth\u2019s vital ozone layer.\\nThe concept of sustainable development had also emerged from the conference: equitable economic growth that preserved the environment for future generations. Nurtured by leading economists like Barbara Ward and boosted by the then Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi\u2019s insistence that poverty was the worst form of pollution, it became one of the enduring legacies of the conference.\\nAnother was pioneering the participation of pressure groups: 258 attended, from Greenpeace to the International Federation of Beekeepers. And they made a difference \u2013 effectively pushing through a call to ban whaling.\\nBut momentum soon slowed. The 1973 oil crisis first seemed to reinforce environmentalism, stressing the precariousness of resources. But attention was diverted as an economic crisis, and then another price shock followed. Nixon \u2013 who had gone green out of political opportunism, not conviction \u2013 quickly dropped it (his infamous tapes recorded him likening environmentalists to \u201ca bunch of damned animals\u201d) as did other leaders. And the environment got pushed to the back of the shelf.\\nNow there is another moment. Last year\u2019s Cop26 summit in Glasgow achieved more than was expected, with governments giving themselves this year \u2013 until another summit, in Egypt in November \u2013 in which to do more. So far, not much has happened, but potential exists, not least to cut emissions of methane and similar pollutants, a hitherto neglected measure that could cut the rate of warming in half.\\nAlso this year another summit will be asked to approve a 10-year strategy to protect nature and biodiversity.\\nAnd what of economics, once thought to conflict so much with environmentalism? It is increasingly recognised that they must be in concert, that the old models of extractive capitalism just do not work, that the only way to forward is to embrace a circular economy and go green. Just this week a study by Deloitte said reaching net zero carbon emissions would benefit the world economy by $43tn (\u00a334tn) over the next half century.\\nIt\u2019s desperately late, long past time to stop driving, full tilt, down the wrong side of the road.
