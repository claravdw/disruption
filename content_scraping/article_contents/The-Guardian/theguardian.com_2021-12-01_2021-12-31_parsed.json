Looking at the US alone, California more than doubled its previous annual wildfire record with more than 1.7m hectares (4.1m acres) burned and Nasa concluded that 2020 had been the joint hottest year on record. The US\u2019s Noaa and the UK Met Office put it in close second to 2016.\\nAnd 2021 \u2013 the year that would see the crucial UN climate summit held in Glasgow in November \u2013 was not showing signs of being much better. The continent of Africa had its warmest January on record, while torrential rains fell in Malaysia, leading to the evacuation of 50,000 people and the death of at least six. Meanwhile in Turkey there were fears that Istanbul would run out of water following the most severe drought in a decade.\\nBut there were small steps of progress on other fronts. Within hours of becoming president, Joe Biden announced that the US would be rejoining the Paris agreement. The Israeli company StoreDot announced that car batteries that could be fully charged in five minutes had been produced in a Chinese factory for the first time.\\nIn my view, we\u2019ve already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis and we can\u2019t wait any longer. We see it with our own eyes, we feel it, we know it in our bones, and it\u2019s time to act.\\nJoe Biden\\nAnd in the UK a plan to reintroduce white-tailed eagles to the east of the country was, unusually, led by farmers, who said they wanted to \u201cinspire people with nature and drive wider nature recovery\u201d.\\nThe internationally renowned scientist James Hansen waded into the UK\u2019s row over plans for a new coalmine in Cumbria, saying it showed \u201ccontemptuous disregard for the future of young people\u201d. A few days earlier, nine activists had announced that they were in a tunnel under London\u2019s Euston station, dug secretly beneath a tent, in order to protest against the high-speed rail link the UK government was in the process of building.\\nA historic wave of winter weather hit the eastern US and Texas, with nearly 10 million people without power at the storm\u2019s peak, and millions without water after pipes burst; it was later assessed to have been the most costly winter storm event on record.\\nIn an amazing rewilding operation in Indonesia, 10 rescued orangutans were returned to the wild. Helicopters were used to ferry the critically endangered apes deep into the forest.\\nAnd in Madagascar scientists found what is believed to be the smallest reptile on Earth. Brookesia nana, a nano-chameleon, has a body the size of a sunflower seed, just 13.5mm long.\\nNew York was lit up by news that dolphins had come to play in the East River \u2013 validation of a long-term clean-up of the river which had cost the city $45m. Further north, in the Midway Atoll wildlife refuge in the North Pacific, the \u201coldest wild bird in history\u201d, 70-year-old Wisdom the Laysan albatross, hatched another chick. Banded by biologist Chandler Robbins in 1956, Wisdom has outlived a number of partners (albatrosses normally mate for life).\\nOn the other side of the planet, Australia was being hit by horrendous floods, with thousands forced to flee rising waters in New South Wales, and the insurance industry facing millions of dollars in claims. The same region, meanwhile, was also battling a mouse plague, with horrifying footage showing the ground moving as the rodents took over.\\nIn the US, Deb Haaland was confirmed as the first ever indigenous cabinet secretary, as she took over the environment department. The huge surge in renewable energy around the world continued, with China announcing that it had built windfarms with a staggering total capacity of almost 100GW in 2020 \u2013 an increase of nearly 60% on 2019. But Climate Action 100, launching the first ever benchmark for tracking corporate progress on climate change, found that only a handful of the big polluters were taking serious action.\\nA landmark legal decision by the German supreme constitutional court found that the government\u2019s climate protection measures were insufficient to protect future generations. The government promised it would take action on what one of the young activists who had brought the case called \u201ca huge win for the climate movement\u201d. In the UK meanwhile, the coroner who oversaw the sad case of a young girl, Ella Kissi-Debrah, who died after an asthma attack in 2013, published a report which called for the lowering of legally binding maximum levels of particulate air pollution in the UK.\\nAnd in the US, a two-day summit on climate change was wound up with promises on all sides, including one from the US to cut its greenhouse gases by 50-52% by 2030. The country also pledged to double financial aid to help other countries with their targets. \u201cIs it enough? No,\u201d said John Kerry, Biden\u2019s climate envoy, who had earlier struck a deal to cooperate with China on climate change. \u201cBut it\u2019s the best we can do today and proves we can start to move.\u201d\\nThe shifts came against the background of a troubling development however, as scientists concluded that the warm Atlantic current linked to severe and abrupt changes in the climate in the past was now at its weakest in at least 1,600 years. The current is known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc).\\nHuge sandstorms in China turned the skies over Beijing yellow for several days, while Cyclone Seroja brought heavy rain and strong winds to Western Australia, with some locations seeing their highest ever daily rainfall.\\nA Dutch court ordered Royal Dutch Shell to cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 in an unprecedented ruling that will have huge implications for the energy industry and other polluting multinationals. The decision came just as the International Energy Agency published Net Zero by 2050, a landmark report which stated that exploitation and development of new oil and gas fields would have to stop this year, and no new coal-fired power stations could be built if the world wanted to stay within safe limits of global heating and meet the goal of net zero emissions by 2050.\\nMeanwhile in Australia the federal court found that the environment minister, Sussan Ley, had a duty of care to protect young people from the climate crisis, in what lawyers said was \u201cthe first time in the world\u201d such a duty of care had been recognised.\\nIn France, the minister for ecological transition delighted and appalled people in equal measure with the announcement that the new climate law would take meat off the menu once a week in schools.\\nTurkey was hit by \u201csea snot\u201d \u2013 a blanket of mucus-like stuff that was silting up the coasts, created as a result of warm temperatures and agricultural run-off that encouraged phytoplankton to grow. But in California, after a short and late rainy season, the governor was declaring an impending drought emergency in 41 of 58 counties.\\nOne of the most extraordinary and powerful heatwaves ever experienced by North America hit the west coast in June and did not go away. Caused by what meteorologists called a \u201cdome of high pressure\u201d, the heatwave extended from California \u2013 worsening the drought even as the first wildfires of the season began \u2013 all the way up to Canada, where temperatures rose up to 121.28F (49.6C), shattering all previous records. \u201cThis is the beginning of a permanent emergency,\u201d the governor of Washington state said.\\nOther parts of the world also saw scorching temperatures. Both Europe and Asia had their second warmest Junes on record, while Africa and New Zealand had the warmest June ever recorded.\\nBut efforts to fight back continued too. Poland announced it would shut down Be\u0142chat\u00f3w, Europe\u2019s most polluting power plant (although only in 2036). The City of London said it would be creating a heat network and digging boreholes for one of the UK\u2019s largest low-carbon heating systems.\\nSri Lanka braced itself for disaster after the MV X-Press Pearl, a ship carrying toxic chemicals, caught fire off the coast and sank. Meanwhile China was fixating on a herd of elephants that had trekked 300 miles into the city of Kunming.\\nThe average global surface temperature for July was the hottest since records began in 1880, with Death Valley in California registering 54.4C (130F).\\nAs the US heatwaves and droughts worsened, India, China and Europe were being hit by catastrophic floods. Torrential downpours on India\u2019s west coast led to 115 deaths, while Henan province in China saw a year\u2019s worth of rain \u2013 604mm \u2013 in a single day. Horrifying videos showed the waters rising in subways, while hundreds of thousands were forced to evacuate. And in Germany rows broke out when it emerged that a flood early-warning system had failed to work, after torrents of rainwater tore through villages and towns, leaving more than a hundred people dead.\\nMeanwhile the Australian government continued to fight attempts to have the Great Barrier Reef declared \u201cin danger\u201d, with local politicians saying they feared for the impact the declaration would have on jobs. In the UK, the water company Southern Water was fined a record \u00a390m after a six-year investigation found evidence that it had deliberately poured untreated sewage into the sea in order to avoid the cost of upgrading infrastructure.\\nAnd, to top off a gloomy month for the planet, new data showed that the melting of Greenland was surging, with the amount of ice vanishing in a single day enough to cover the whole of Florida in 5cm of water, according to researchers.\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change delivered its starkest warning to the world yet, concluding that climate change was unequivocally caused by human activities, and warning that some of the impacts were now inevitable and \u201cirreversible\u201d.\\nAs the heat continued, wildfires broke out in the Mediterranean, where the Greek prime minister described them as the country\u2019s \u201cgreatest ecological disaster in decades\u201d, and across more than 9m hectares of forests in Siberia.\\nMeanwhile floods and landslides hit Japan, where more than a million people were evacuated from their homes, and also Turkey, Colombia, and Tennessee in the US, where a record-breaking deluge swept through homes and roads. Rain fell on the highest point of the Greenland ice sheet for the first time on record.\\nA Swedish company shipped the world\u2019s first customer delivery of \u201cgreen steel\u201d \u2013 made without using coal \u2013 as solar power outstripped coal in Australia for the first time when, for a fleeting moment, more electricity was generated by solar power.\\nIn the UK, Extinction Rebellion swung back into action, blocking London Bridge and Oxford Circus, pouring red paint in entrances at the City of London and locking on outside the Science Museum over its sponsorship deal with the oil giant Shell.\\n\u201cBlah blah blah\u201d was what Greta Thunberg called the promises from global leaders around the world to tackle climate change, pointing out that carbon emissions were still on track to rise 16% by 2030. As Cop26 drew nearer, and following the summer of record-breaking fires, heatwaves and floods, politicians everywhere were under increasing pressure to improve their offers. A US/EU deal to reduce methane emissions felt like a good contribution.\\nA new protest movement launched in the UK, as Insulate Britain demonstrators began sitting on motorways to demand climate action in the form of insulation for the country\u2019s housing stock. In Scotland, as preparations sped up, one man built an ark on a hillside, telling the planning committee when it asked if it was a permanent structure: \u201cIt\u2019s not permanent in the same way that humanity won\u2019t be if we don\u2019t take action on the climate.\u201d\\nIn a painful irony, new data revealed that the wildfires were themselves releasing record-breaking amounts of carbon dioxide. Meanwhile, an energy crisis was breaking across the world, with sky-high gas prices in Europe and pressure on electricity and coal supplies in China.\\nChina hosted the Kunming conference on biodiversity and announced a $233m (\u00a3170m) fund to protect biodiversity in developing countries.\\nWe shall take the development of an ecological civilisation as our guide to coordinate the relationship between man and nature.\\nXi Jinping\\nWith just days to go before Cop26, Australia, one of the countries most notorious for holding out against climate action, published its plan for how it would reduce carbon emissions, but it was called \u201ca scam\u201d containing no detail and no modelling.\\nElsewhere, however, signs of change were palpable, with a series of plans announced at the Middle East Green Initiative Summit, organised by Saudi Arabia. Their neighbours, the United Arab Emirates, will be hosting Cop28 in two years\u2019 time.\\nA Tesla became the first ever battery-powered car to top Europe\u2019s sales chart. And in the UK, the government was forced by a near rebellion to U-turn and place a duty on water companies to reduce sewage discharges.\\nIn the US, one senator gained global notoriety: Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat, was holding out against his own party for huge cuts to President Biden\u2019s climate change plans. For a brief moment, it looked as if Biden would have to go to Cop26 with no legislative progress at home.\\nCop26 was under way at last, after two years of pandemic, delays, worries, criticisms and negotiations. World leaders gathered for the first two days and were exhorted by David Attenborough to be \u201cmotivated by hope rather than fear\u201d. Biden had finally got his infrastructure bill passed, but the UK\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson, put a dampener on events by making his speech and then hopping into a private jet to make the short journey to London.\\nThe first week saw an onslaught of deals on methane, deforestation, coal, the ambition to stick to 1.5C of warming and finance, with hundreds of the world\u2019s biggest banks and pension funds with assets worth $130tn committing themselves to limiting greenhouse gas emissions.\\nBy the end of the second week of hard negotiation, the summit\u2019s president, Alok Sharma, had cajoled countries into a deal including a ratchet mechanism that asked every country to upgrade its emission reduction plans in time for the next Cop in Egypt in a year\u2019s time, and each year thereafter. However, many were dismayed that the deal did not include the loss and damage facility that most of the world had asked for, to help developing countries in particular pay for the impacts of the climate crisis already being felt.\\nBeyond the summit, rain storms hit British Columbia in Canada, earlier battered by the summer\u2019s heatwaves, broke up roads and led to a state of emergency.\\nOut in the oceans one of the rarest animals in the world was glimpsed: the mythical white sperm whale, seen surfacing for a moment, from the waters off Jamaica.\\nThe World Meteorological Organization (WMO) announced in the middle of the month that it had recognised a new Arctic temperature record: the summer of 2020 had seen the Russian town of Verkhoyansk hit with an all-time high of 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F).\\nFloods swept Queensland, Australia, with up to 180mm of rain falling in 24 hours in some parts of the state. The UK was hit by Storm Arwen and Storm Barra. Heavy rains fell in Iraq, leading to serious flooding and displacement. And tornadoes ripped through North America, with at least 70 deaths in Kentucky in what was described as the \u201cmost devastating tornado event\u201d in the state\u2019s history, only to be followed, by the end of the month, by record-breaking temperatures and snowfall.\\nEO Wilson, who died on 26 December, had warned many times that humans could not continue to use the land and resources of the planet in the way they did. The biologist was caught up in controversies at times during his career. Nevertheless, his warning that \u201cwe live in a delusional state\u201d if we do not understand the burden that the western way of life imposes on Earth, rings true even now.\\nIf all mankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed 10,000 years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos.\\nEO Wilson, biologist\\nThis article was amended on 6 January 2022.

I want to keep making climate conscious decisions.\u201d\\nIn the wake of Powershop\u2019s acquisition, finding another clean power company that checks all the boxes may seem an overwhelming feat.\\nCasule says there are \u201ca few different things\u201d Australians should consider if making the switch to a new clean energy provider.\\nCasule outlines the three types of electricity retailers we have to choose from.\\n\u201cYou have Gentailers (a combination of generators and retailers), that include giants like AGL, Shell and Origin.\u201d Casule says these energy giants are generally \u201cbad with climate\u201d.\\n\u201cThen you have many retailers who source from as close to 100% renewable sources. And you have companies in the middle, that are usually profit-driven retailers.\u201d\\nLooking into each option involves comparing your budget with your climate priorities, and learning whether a retailer\u2019s parent company engages in fossil fuel extraction. \u201cI would imagine Powershop would score worse on that criteria now,\u201d Casule says.\\nFor homeowners, Lawson says \u201cif you do want to put your money into renewable energy, investing in solar power is also an option\u201d.\\nNext, Casule reminds us that \u201cunfortunately, the way our electricity system works is actually quite opaque\u201d.\\nAustralia\u2019s electricity system was previously nationalised. \u201cThe government built the powerplants, ran the powerplants, and sold electricity to consumers,\u201d Casule says.\\nOver the last 30 years, however, public electricity utilities have been sold to private owners at various rates across each state. This introduced an additional step that wasn\u2019t there before. Now, generators sell electricity into a wholesale market, and retailers buy from that market to sell on to consumers, at a mark-up.\\n\u201cAnybody with an internet connection and a laptop can set up an energy retailer,\u201d Casule says. \u201cYou don\u2019t need big steam boilers.

First, the company renamed its Adani mining operations to Bravus.\\nThen it changed the name of the Adani Abbot Point Terminal, north of Bowen, to North Queensland Export Terminal (the words Adani and coal don\u2019t appear on the corporate website).\\n\u201cThat name change definitely gave the impression the name Adani was becoming an impediment,\u201d says Vincent. \u201cIf you\u2019re confident in your brand you don\u2019t change it to something else.\u201d\\nVincent says the campaign has had other knock-on effects well away from the Adani mine.\\n\\nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\\n\u201cIt\u2019s been the catalyst for dozens of financial institutions around the world to rule out thermal coal projects,\u201d he says. \u201cThe risk of being associated with large [coal] projects has become reputational kryptonite.\u201d\\nIn May, fossil fuel producers complained to a parliamentary inquiry that campaigns against the industry were now making it harder to finance and insure major projects.\\nAdani told the inquiry it had been refused loans and insurance, and contractors and business partners had walked away.\\nIn a submission, the company said \u201cthe boycotting of Australia\u2019s thermal coal industry by Australian banks and insurance companies is misconceived and indifferent to the manifest damage their decisions will have on the industry\u2019s ability to remain globally competitive\u201d and it would impact Australia\u2019s economy.\\nVincent says while the first coal being shipped is \u201ca crap moment for the campaign\u201d, major financial groups continue to distance themselves from the project, joining scores of others.\\nLast month one of the world\u2019s biggest banks cut ties with the project saying the venture is incompatible with its environmental, social and governance rules. \n  Activists continue to target the project \u2013 locking themselves on to rail lines and rolling stock and suspending themselves from cranes at the company\u2019s port. Two protesters clambered aboard one of the project\u2019s trains this week and spent a day allegedly shovelling coal over the side.\n  Separately, some Wangan and Jagalingou traditional owners have long opposed the project, saying it will destroy their cultural lands and risk the sacred Doongmabulla springs. The miner has a formal land-use agreement with the Wangan and Jagalingou people but the agreement is opposed by some traditional owners.\\nTraditional owners have been carrying out continuous cultural ceremonies on the mining lease for more than 90 days.\\nAdrian Burragubba, a traditional owner who has battled Adani for years, says Adani \u201cshould not be celebrating\u201d.\\nHis family and other traditional owners are concerned cultural sites with \u201cliterally thousands of artefacts\u201d are being disturbed.\\nBurragubba says his son Coedy McAvoy has been on the land since 28 August performing ceremonies. \u201cHe declares he\u2019ll remain there,\u201d says Burragubba. \u201cIt\u2019s our duty to take care of the land and monitor what the mining company is doing.\u201d\\nAdani has been calling for the police to step in to remove McAvoy, as well as to take stronger action against different protesters targeting the railway.\\nIn October, police told McAvoy and others camped on the company\u2019s mining lease they would not remove them \u201cat this time\u201d.\\nThe Australian Conservation Foundation, a member of the Stop Adani Alliance, successfully overturned federal approval for the mine\u2019s water scheme earlier this year, with the issue still unresolved.\\nThe ACF chief executive, Kelly O\u2019Shanassy, said the campaign still had much to achieve. As insurers, financiers and contractors walked away, there were \u201cstill questions about the viability\u201d of the project.\\nShe says the group will work \u201cincredibly hard\u201d to stop the Galilee basin opening, but Stop Adani is a defining climate campaign.\\n\u201cYour position on Adani indicated your position on climate, particularly politically. It became a litmus test.\\n\u201cACF has been switching the focus to escalating the clean future and we couldn\u2019t have got people interested in that unless there was an end to coal and gas. I think we\u2019ve won the public argument on that.\u201d\\nSince the campaign against Adani began, the world\u2019s financial markets have shifted away from coal. At the Glasgow climate summit, more than 40 countries agreed to phase out coal power.\\n\u201cIf we decide that in 2021 we cannot be adding more coal to the global market, then that\u2019s a decision we have to hold ourselves to,\u201d Vincent says.\\nOver the course of the campaign, there have been scores of other fossil fuel projects that have been announced, developed and approved. Did the focus on Adani shift the campaigns \u2013 and the eyes of the public \u2013 to just one spot in north Queensland?\\n\u201cEven a dark firmament needs its darkest stars,\u201d says David Ritter, the chief executive of Greenpeace Australia Pacific.\\n\u201cThe scale of the Galilee Basin demanded that attention.\\n\u201cBut the campaign drew attention to the overall issue and hopefully generated the kind of community enthusiasm to oppose [fossil fuel projects] everywhere else in Australia, not just at the Adani mine.\u201d\\nThe Guardian asked Adani Australia when it expected to export its first coal from the Carmichael mine and requested an interview with its chief executive, Lucas Dow.\\nA spokeswoman sent a short statement, saying: \u201cThe Carmichael Mine is on track to export coal in 2021.\u201d", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9fb8ea7355ba76089c3f59dd2779cf21fa07804/0_222_4828_2898/master/4828.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Anti-Adani coalmine protesters in Brisbane in March"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbe33c86bcf65e2e13540ea570a29bdd2a3c799f/0_244_4681_2809/master/4681.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Wangan and Jagalingou traditional owner Adrian Burragubba speaks during a rally at Queensland parliament in August"]], "author": ["Graham Readfearn", "Ben Smee"], "date": "2021-12-17"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/31/waste-colonialism-countries-grapple-with-wests-unwanted-plastic": {"title": "\u2018Waste colonialism\u2019: world grapples with west\u2019s unwanted plastic", "subtitle": null, "text": "Germany and UK are big exporters of plastic, much of which lies rotting in ports in Turkey, Vietnam and other countries\\nOne hundred and 41 containers filled with rotting plastic waste have been on a journey for more than a year. Scattered between Turkey, Greece and Vietnam, far from their origins in Germany, the containers\u2019 voyage sheds light on the hidden global trade in plastic waste.\\nArriving in Turkey in late 2020, shortly before a ban on mixed plastic waste imports came into force, the containers quickly became the centre of a battle between traders, a shipping line, multiple governments and environmental campaigners demanding their return.\\nTurkish authorities refused entry to the containers, leaving them in limbo. As they languished in ports across the country, the contents began to rot. \u201cAfter a couple of months, all the dirty waste inside was disrupted, and some had fermented due to the presence of micro-organisms. It smelled really bad and it was covered in rats and mice,\u201d said Sedat G\u00fcndo\u011fdu, a plastics pollution researcher based in the southern city of Adana.\\nThe year-long saga of the 141 containers is a small slice of the international trade in plastic waste, the ugly underbelly of recycling in the global north. Plastic waste, especially mixed plastic from households, is frequently sent overseas to countries with lax environmental regulations, where it is melted into plastic pellets, dumped, or simply burned.\\nMixed plastics are the dirtiest and least desirable waste in the trade, as they typically contain household rubbish such as bottles or packaging, meaning a jumble of recyclable plastics with non-recyclable items. As many countries move to ban mixed plastic imports, observers say some traders have taken to hiding bales of banned mixed plastics behind others that pass regulation to sneak them past inspectors.\\nThe containers remained stuck after a company involved in their initial journey lost its import licence and disappeared. \u201cThe consignee delayed us saying there were some things to sort out with customs. But then we found out their import licence was cancelled, and they were blacklisted by Turkey. Lab tests showed some loads in the containers are hazardous city waste,\u201d said Omer Bulduk of Monax, a Turkish freight company assigned to receive the containers. \u201cIt\u2019s simply garbage,\u201d he added.\\nSome of the countries listed among the world\u2019s top recyclers are also the biggest plastic waste exporters: Germany was named the world\u2019s top recycler by the World Economic Forum three years ago, but exports an average of 1m tonnes of plastic waste annually, more than any other nation in the EU. The UK is little better, exporting 61% of its plastic waste according to recent data from the British Plastics Foundation.\\n\u201cWhen you continue to consume more plastic there are only two ways to tackle the waste. One is incineration, the second is dumping. If you don\u2019t have dumping in your country then you should incinerate. But this has a carbon footprint, and many countries trying to cut carbon emissions don\u2019t want to incinerate their own waste,\u201d said G\u00fcndo\u011fdu.\\n\u201cSome of the top waste producers in Europe, like the UK, France and Germany have to find ways to deal with this issue. And the way they\u2019ve found is exporting to poorer countries without effective waste management systems or environmental legislation and regulations. This is waste colonialism,\u201d he said.\\nIn May, the Turkish foreign ministry contacted their counterparts in Germany to demand the containers\u2019 return. According to Bulduk, the German side \u201cclaimed that too much time had passed and they cannot accept them\u201d. Angela Griesbach, a spokesperson for the waste management authority in the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, now in charge of overseeing the containers, said this was \u201cprobably a misunderstanding\u201d, adding that the containers contained waste that was legal when it arrived in Turkey.\\nWhen some of the containers of German waste were suddenly re-exported to Vietnam, campaigners sprung into action. Activists believe that the 16 containers sent last July to the port of Hai Phong were a test, to see if others could later follow the same route in order to dispose of the rotting containers entirely. But who authorised their onward travel remains a mystery, especially as sending waste directly from an EU country to those outside the OECD is banned, and new controls on mixed plastic exports introduced last January require express consent from the Vietnamese authorities to import the containers.\\nVietnam\u2019s own ban on plastic waste imports is due to go into force in 2025, but it remains a popular destination for the global plastic recycling trade. There, workers are paid less than \u00a35 a day to sort plastic into recyclable elements and non-recyclable. The former are melted down, exposing those nearby to toxic fumes.\\nJim Puckett of the Basel Action Network, a group that campaigns against plastic-related pollution, tracked 37 of the German containers heading towards Piraeus port near Athens in November, and grew suspicious they were also headed to Vietnam.\\n\u201cI dropped what I was doing and sent a strong message to the Greek authorities, saying that they couldn\u2019t allow that waste to get on a ship and go to Vietnam. It\u2019s illegal and it should be returned to Germany,\u201d he said. The Greek authorities took note, and cordoned off the containers on the dock in Piraeus, where they remain.\\n\u201cThere\u2019s also almost a hundred containers sitting in Turkey, and we\u2019re very worried they will be bound for countries like Vietnam,\u201d he added. In an open letter to Germany\u2019s newly inaugurated environment ministry, a coalition of green groups including BAN demanded they \u201ctake moral and political leadership\u201d and reclaim the 141 containers.\\nWhen contacted by the Guardian, the environment ministry referred questions to Griesbach. \u201cThe campaigners are right in saying that there are many legal questions and legal grey areas,\u201d she said. She stressed that \u201ca voluntary return shipment by a German company involved is intended but has not yet been possible,\u201d and said the German authorities were unaware that some containers had been re-exported to Vietnam.\\nIf certain conditions were met, she added, the containers in Turkey could be returned. \u201cIf the problem is not an internal Turkish enforcement problem, the German authorities, as well as the German company voluntarily, are willing to take back this waste in accordance with the law. However, this requires the corresponding cooperation and information from the Turkish side.\u201d The Turkish environment ministry did not respond when contacted for comment on the issue.\\nVietnam and Turkey are two of a growing number of countries that have reported a sudden spike in plastic waste, after China\u2019s decision to ban waste imports in 2018 proved to be a watershed for the global trade. The decision \u201creverberated around the world\u201d, according to the United Nations, which added that nations in the global north \u201cwill, at last, have to face up to the true cost of their plastic addiction instead of shipping the problem to China, which has taken nearly half the world\u2019s waste since 1992\u201d.\\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been sold a notion of \u2018don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll recycle it\u2019 \u2013 and no one looked at what recycling was like in China until three years ago,\u201d said Puckett. \u201cWe\u2019re putting out more plastic waste into the world, every day more than the day before, and there\u2019s no destination for it. It\u2019s now become a game of who will take it because there are mountains of plastic waste and it\u2019s not stopped.\u201d\\nThe result is a frantic hunt for new destinations for an estimated 111m metric tonnes of plastic waste displaced by the ban between now and 2030. While China has banned imports, it continues to profit from the global trade in plastics through its domination of the shipping trade. Cosco shipping, the company that transported all 141 containers, is a Chinese state-owned company. Cosco did not respond when contacted for comment on the issue.\\nMatthew Gordon, an environmental researcher at Yale University who is part of a team compiling an \u201catlas of plastic waste\u201d to show new plastic dumping sites across the world, said he was surprised by the number of countries represented in their initial findings, including Bosnia, Thailand, Romania, Malaysia and Turkey.\\n\u201cSouth-east Asia clearly seems to be a hotspot, especially in the aftermath of the China import ban,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the reasons for this seems to be that when container ships travel from places like China to the US carrying manufactured goods, they offer extremely low freight on the return trip \u2013 otherwise they would be going back empty. So exporters in the US often find it cheaper to send plastics abroad than to deal with them at home.\u201d\\nTurkey has increasingly found itself on the frontline of the struggle between local plastic importers\u2019 desire to stay in the global recycling trade and rising environmental concerns. After an investigation by Greenpeace found plastic products from British and German supermarket chains intended for recycling dumped by the roadside, Turkey briefly banned all plastic imports last May before rescinding the law soon afterwards. G\u00fcndo\u011fdu said new dumping grounds for plastic waste were springing up again after a brief lull.\\nIn Adana, a hub for plastic waste imports, a coalition of local plastics traders wrote their own open letter to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, imploring him to allow the industry to continue. The letter was part of a campaign to rebrand plastic waste imports, under the slogan \u201cIt\u2019s not waste, it\u2019s raw material.\u201d\\nThe plastic waste industry, they said, employs 300,000 Turkish people. Traders described themselves as \u201cthe ones cleaning the environment, not polluting it\u201d.\\nMany Turkish citizens disagree. When asked how they felt about the 800,000 tonnes of plastic waste that Turkey imported last year from the EU, a majority said \u201cvery bad\u201d, while others cited a slogan that is rapidly becoming a rallying cry against plastic imports in their country: \u201cTurkey is not a garbage bin.\u201d\\nAdditional reporting by G\u00f6k\u00e7e Sara\u00e7o\u011flu", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718f068015a41e9fba6c755c69159fc1b55a064d/0_243_4252_2553/master/4252.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Hands holding up an empty back of M&S bacon and a device showing location"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cecc218654839ddf10dce74a29cbef1b1e270091/0_95_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Plastic waste found by Greenpeace in Adana province in Turkey"]], "author": ["Ruth Michaelson"], "date": "2021-12-31"}}
