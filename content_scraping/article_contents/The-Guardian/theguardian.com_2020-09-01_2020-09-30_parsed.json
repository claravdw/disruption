It also comes at a time when human rights violations, particularly against India\u2019s 200 million Muslims, are on the rise.\\nThis crackdown on critics \u2013 including lawyers, activists and students \u2013 has increased during the coronavirus pandemic. Courts are only partly functioning and protest gatherings have been banned.\\nAvinash Kumar, the executive director of Amnesty International India, said: \u201cTreating human rights organisations like criminal enterprises and dissenting individuals as criminals without any credible evidence is a deliberate attempt by the enforcement directorate and government of India to stoke a climate of fear and dismantle the critical voices in India.\u201d\\nHe added: \u201cIt reeks of fear and repression, ignores the human cost to this crackdown, particularly during a pandemic, and violates people\u2019s basic rights.\u201d\\nAmnesty International India\u2019s bank accounts were frozen this month by the enforcement directorate without any prior warning. The human rights organisation has had to lay off 140 staff and cease operations immediately.\\nAuthorities have been pursuing Amnesty for two years for alleged money laundering, a process described as an \u201cincessant witch-hunt\u201d by the group. Since 2018, a number of raids have been carried out on its offices and the homes of its executives by several government agencies.\\nAmnesty has denied all allegations of financial misconduct and said it stood in full compliance with all applicable Indian and international laws. No charges have been filed against the organisation.\\nIn a statement, the ministry of home affairs said that the \u201cstand taken and the statements made by Amnesty International are unfortunate, exaggerated and far from the truth\u201d.\\nThe ministry accused Amnesty India of bringing foreign funding into the country illegally and failing to comply with regulations, adding: \u201cAll the glossy statements about humanitarian work and speaking truth to power are nothing but a ploy to divert attention from their activities which were in clear contravention of laid down Indian laws.\u201d\\nKenneth Roth, director of Human Rights Watch, which has also produced reports on the mounting human rights abuses under the BJP, condemned the crackdown on Amnesty India and said it was \u201cyet more evidence that prime minister Modi\u2019s government is failing to uphold freedom of speech and association\u201d.\\nShashi Tharoor, a politician from the opposition Congress party, said: \u201cIndia\u2019s stature as a liberal democracy with free institutions, including media and civil society organisations, accounted for much of its soft power in the world. Actions like this both undermine our reputation as a democracy and vitiate our soft power.\u201d\\nMost recently, Amnesty published two reports critical of Indian authorities: one alleging rights violations and involvement of police in communal riots in Delhi, and another condemning restrictions on civil liberties in Jammu and Kashmir a year after the government revoked the region\u2019s political autonomy.\\n\u201cThe continuing crackdown on Amnesty International India over the last two years and the complete freezing of bank accounts is not accidental,\u201d the organisation said in a statement.\\nThere has been a particular focus from the Indian government on organisations perceived to be funded from overseas. This month, it tightened restrictions on foreign-funded charities and has previously frozen the bank accounts of Greenpeace and raided the offices of human rights lawyers.\\nJulie Verhaar, Amnesty International\u2019s acting secretary general, said: \u201cThis is an egregious and shameful act by the Indian government, which forces us to cease the crucial human rights work of Amnesty International India for now.\u201d", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b6c1a7f3d12b7c71c90ba44ff6366d4e687665f/0_417_5396_3238/master/5396.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Amnesty office in India"]], "author": ["Hannah Ellis-Petersen", "Ben Doherty"], "date": "2020-09-29"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/08/extinction-rebellion-criminals-threaten-uks-way-of-life-says-priti-patel": {"title": "Extinction Rebellion 'criminals' threaten UK way of life, says Priti Patel", "subtitle": null, "text": "Home secretary tells police superintendents she will not allow XR \u2018anarchy\u2019 on streets\\nThe home secretary, Priti Patel, has claimed Extinction Rebellion activists are \u201cso-called eco-crusaders turned criminals\u201d who threaten key planks of national life.\\nThe government\u2019s rhetorical venom against XR was triggered by the blockading of newspaper print works at the weekend, which disrupted the distribution of some newspapers and led to scores of arrests.\\nThe Guardian understands, however, that despite the government threatening to crack down on the climate emergency group, more than a year of talks between police and ministers about law changes has yet to produce any public plans.\\nPatel described XR as an \u201cemerging threat\u201d in a speech to the annual conference of the Police Superintendents\u2019 Association on Tuesday.\\nShe said XR was \u201cattempting to thwart the media\u2019s right to publish without fear nor favour\u201d, and claimed their campaign of civil disobedience was \u201ca shameful attack on our way of life, our economy and the livelihoods of the hard-working majority\u201d.\\n\u201cI refuse point blank to allow that kind of anarchy on our streets,\u201d the home secretary told the virtual conference.\\n\u201cThe very criminals who disrupt our free society must be stopped.

Seeing Boris Johnson ritually dismembered in parliament might make us feel better, but nothing changes. He still has an 80-seat majority, though less than 30% of the electorate voted for the Conservatives. We are reduced, for five long years, to spectators.\\nOur system allows the victorious government a mandate to do what it likes between elections, without further reference to the people. As we have seen, this can include breaking international law, suspending parliament, curtailing the judiciary, politicising the civil service, attacking the Electoral Commission and invoking royal prerogative powers to make policy without anyone\u2019s consent. This is not democracy, but a parody of democracy.\\nBy contrast to our five-yearly vote, capital can respond to government policy every second, withdrawing its consent with catastrophic consequences if it doesn\u2019t like its drift. There\u2019s a massive imbalance of power here. The voting power of capital, with modern trading technologies, has advanced by leaps and bounds. Electoral power is trapped in the age of the quill pen.\\nThe problem, in other words, is not just Johnson. The problem is the UK\u2019s political system, which presents an open invitation for autocratic behaviour. In the past, people warned that a ruthless operator could make hay with this system. Well, that moment has come.\\nLabour has long been part of the problem, refusing to contemplate even a change to our preposterous first-past-the-post elections, let alone any wider surrender of power. And it is tragic to watch it now, still playing by the old rules. These state that a party should not show its hand until a few months before the election. That\u2019s four years away, and the power grab is happening now. We urgently need a stirring alternative vision, a call to democratic arms. Instead, we get forensic dissections of particular government policies: admirably done, but unmatched to the moment.\\nAt moments like this, old parties flounder. New ideas arise outside the system, and effective opposition takes place on the street. Of course, this is difficult now, as there are good public health reasons not to gather in large numbers, and we can expect the government to exploit them. But civil disobedience is ever-inventive, constantly developing new tactics in response to attempts to shut it down.\\nWe saw some of these in Extinction Rebellion\u2019s latest week of protests, and we saw something else too: its emergence as a broad oppositional movement, taking on the billionaire press, the lobbyists, the banks and other bastions of power, that are not usually associated with the extinction and climate crises, but are fundamental to them. From the beginning, XR has been both an environmental movement and a democracy movement: participatory politics, in the form of citizens\u2019 assemblies, has been one of its key demands.\\nLike the suffragettes and the civil rights movement, it was excoriated for threatening \u201cour way of life\u201d. Almost all democratic advances, everywhere, have been secured by people who were branded \u201canarchists\u201d and \u201ccriminals\u201d.\\nThe democratic and environmental crises have the same roots: our exclusion, for several years at a time, from meaningful politics. In some places, particularly Ireland, Iceland, France, Taiwan, British Columbia, Ontario and several Spanish and Brazilian cities, a host of fascinating experiments with new democratic forms has been taking place: constitutional conventions, citizens\u2019 assemblies, community development, digital deliberation and participatory budgeting. They are designed to give people a voice between elections, tempering representative democracy, allowing them to refine their choices.\\nThe UK pays lip service to these innovations. Last week the citizens\u2019 assembly on climate, convened by parliament, published its findings, which included suggestions such as taxing frequent fliers, getting rid of SUVs and eating less red meat. But there are no obvious means by which they can be adopted by the government. In Scotland, all local authorities allow residents to set part of their budgets, though so far, it\u2019s very small: just 1% of the money allocated by central government.\\nUnless the results of participatory democracy can be translated into policy, and unless it operates at a meaningful scale, it generates cynicism and disillusion. But as the processes in Ireland, Madrid and in some Brazilian cities have shown, when people are allowed to make big and frequent decisions, the results can be transformative. Alienated, polarised populations come together to identify and solve their common problems. Democracy becomes a lived reality.\\nNowhere has participatory politics yet been allowed to fulfil its promise. There is no principled or technical reason why the majority of a municipal or national budget should not be set through public deliberation, following techniques pioneered in the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre. There is no principled or technical reason why the monthly voting process for improving life in Reykjavik could not be applied at the national level, everywhere. The call for full-scale participatory democracy is as revolutionary as the call for the universal franchise was in the 19th century. What is needed is a vehicle similar in scale to the Chartist and suffragette movements.\\nThere are precedents for environmental protests mutating into democratic revolutions: this is what helped precipitate the collapse of the Soviet Union. Our climate and extinction crises expose the failures of all quasi-democratic systems, and the blatant capture of ours by the power of money turns the UK into a global crucible.\\nIn XR\u2019s outrageous, reviled protests we see the beginnings of what could become a 21st-century democratic revolution. Through his incompetence, callousness and greed for power, Johnson has done us two favours: exposing the shallowness of our theatrical democracy, and creating a potential coalition ranging from hospital porters to supreme court judges.

What might have seemed a relatively dry idea on paper \u2013 a trawl through 200-year-old art \u2013 turned out to be thumpingly relevant to almost every aspect of modern life, even down to last week\u2019s Extinction Rebellion protests and migrant landings.\\nBecause what the Romantics did was nothing less than change our way of thinking about the world. For good and, sometimes, for ill. Blake, Shelley, Delacroix, Wollstonecraft, Chopin and the rest of the gang, Schama argued with cogency, persuasion and some great phrasemaking, gave us little less than the very ideas of democracy, of national belonging (something of a double-edged sword), of obsession with the self, even interest in nature\u2026 and \u201cwe still think with their mind, we feel with their emotional heartbeat\u201d.\\nThink you\u2019re the first creative type to dare to put politics into your wilfully controversial art? Delacroix and G\u00e9ricault got there way first, the latter with his astonishing Raft of the Medusa. Think cancel culture is an achingly millennial movement? Try the Terror, which spread through Mary Wollstonecraft\u2019s adopted Paris in the years after the Revolution when segments of the left, after a handsome and brave new dawn, began to ensure that thinking the wrong thoughts would not merely get you censored but torched out of (or often inside) your own home. Getting righteous and huffy in middle England at the insidious distribution of inflammatory ideas? Again, nothing on Britain\u2019s aristos in the early 1800s, who closed the free press and outlawed atheism. Schama, without ever being too heavy- handed, drew all these and many more parallels directly back to the Romantic squad\u2019s passionate drive to convert the old religions of veneration and obedience to the new ones of insurrection and agitation.\\nSeldom was this more in evidence in the modern age than France (again) in 1968, students and workers together on barricades. One of Schama\u2019s strengths as a presenter \u2013 and good on the broadcaster for resisting the blandishments of a myriad younger and arguably sexier historians \u2013 is that he can actually say he was in the streets of Paris during that long fraught hopeful summer (working, I believe, on his first book), and thus has an earned right to tell us all about it.\\nCrucially, Schama never talks down, or attempts to sugar the pill by presenting a complex argument as anything other. Your brain has to keep up. This is a great series, sadly only three parts. Plus, we get intriguing art lessons along the way \u2013 and great readings by Christopher Eccleston, Harriet Walter and hip-hop artist Testament.\\nIf good moment of the week was Louis Theroux video-chatting to twins, first encountered 16 years ago, who have grown into lovely understanding human beings, bad moment of the week was the same terribly young twins being encouraged by their mother, that very long time ago, to form, in essence, a Nazi pop group. Smiley-faced Hitler emojis on the T-shirts, abhorrently racist lyrics. Even in hindsight \u2013 Life on the Edge is essentially a back catalogue of greatest hits, interspersed with reflections from an older, bearded, wiser Louis Theroux \u2013 this was a grim and nasty watch.\\nOne might argue that Theroux has, throughout his career, with his mix of charm and his inviting, pregnant, come-hither silences, cleverly mixed interviewees of the near-credible type with those of the (frankly) mentally ill type. Nevertheless, he has told wider truths, from the wilder fringes of humanity and the extremes of belief \u2013 often toxic, or merely of the fruit-loopy conspiracist mindset (JFK: it was suicide) \u2013 and thus expanded our conversations. The twins\u2019 mother, April, he did not blame: she was \u201cincapable of seeing anything through a non-racial lens\u201d. Can any among us feel anything else, now, except pity?\\nTheroux\u2019s fascination is and always has been the exploitation of the vulnerable, and the fact even the most absurd charlatan can inspire real results. But Theroux is inextricably drawn to charlatans, and long may that continue.\\nI have read and heard some mild criticism regarding Sue Perkins being given the big two-nighter documentary Along the US-Mexico Border, seeking some truths about the wall, the border and immigration. Why not a grownup journalist?\\nI\u2019ll tell you exactly why. Perkins is by far the most apt person for the job. She overflows with both natural wit and empathy, and is often braver than she looks. Plus, one aspect of bravery is being unafraid of nuance, of grey areas, open to the concept that one might hold two ideas in one\u2019s head at the same time.\\nThere was little doubt where her loyalties lay: the impassioned plea for fairness towards the end of the second episode showed that Perkins is nothing less than a true romantic. But she was demonstrably capable of showing the same understanding (and warm humour, reciprocated in kind) towards a good-ole-boy Texan rancher overrun nightly by migrants, as she would show to the dirt-poor, and the fleeing, themselves. A news reporter might have let slip far more righteous Trump-contempt; Perkins was sparing with her snark, and thus the programme was greater for letting us make up our own minds. A truly enlightening couple of nights.\\nNot sure whether Leicester\u2019s having a good year of it. It was at a nightclub there where one of the Chocolate Men \u2013 a troupe of 12 black strippers, who have, in co-founder Louis\u2019s words, \u201cto be good dancers and have a penis length of more than eight inches\u201d \u2013 got carried away on his debut dance. In what must have been the most eggshell-fraught phrase uttered in voiceover this year, \u201cDjango allows a woman to briefly engage in oral sex with him\u201d.\\nSo many questions, which the makers of The Black Full Monty, Channel 4\u2019s documentary about Britain\u2019s first all-black male strip group, duly, if but occasionally, asked.\\n\u201cSome might say what you\u2019re doing is perpetuating stereotypes?\u201d \u201cAre you selling sex, or are you selling race?\u201d Louis and co-promoter Dante gamely tried to bat them back: \u201cYou can never satisfy everyone\u2026 anything you do as a black guy is going to be hard\u2026 it\u2019s a stepping-stone, people are earning money, living good, what about that?\u201d But I\u2019m not sure we ever got an answer that would satisfy, say, the head of race and gender studies at Oxbridge Polyversity.\\nPerhaps, because there are so many questions about this, we should (as the makers tended to in the end) just see it a little bit of good dirty fun. As one young Dubliner \u2013 the \u00a325-a-head audiences are overwhelmingly white \u2013 noted: \u201cThink of the years we\u2019ve suffered, tolerated, women being objectified.

But even with the firmest of evidence, we often end up ignoring the facts we don\u2019t like\\nBy the spring of 2020, the high stakes involved in rigorous, timely and honest statistics had suddenly become all too clear. A new coronavirus was sweeping the world. Politicians had to make their most consequential decisions in decades, and fast. Many of those decisions depended on data detective work that epidemiologists, medical statisticians and economists were scrambling to conduct. Tens of millions of lives were potentially at risk. So were billions of people\u2019s livelihoods.\\nIn early April, countries around the world were a couple of weeks into lockdown, global deaths passed 60,000, and it was far from clear how the story would unfold. Perhaps the deepest economic depression since the 1930s was on its way, on the back of a mushrooming death toll. Perhaps, thanks to human ingenuity or good fortune, such apocalyptic fears would fade from memory. Many scenarios seemed plausible. And that\u2019s the problem.\\nAn epidemiologist, John Ioannidis, wrote in mid-March that Covid-19 \u201cmight be a once-in-a-century evidence fiasco\u201d. The data detectives are doing their best \u2013 but they\u2019re having to work with data that\u2019s patchy, inconsistent and woefully inadequate for making life-and-death decisions with the confidence we would like.\\nDetails of this fiasco will, no doubt, be studied for years to come. But some things already seem clear. At the beginning of the crisis, politics seem to have impeded the free flow of honest statistics. Although the claim is contested, Taiwan complained that in late December 2019 it had given important clues about human-to-human transmission to the World Health Organization \u2013 but as late as mid-January, the WHO was reassuringly tweeting that China had found no evidence of human-to-human transmission. (Taiwan is not a member of the WHO, because China claims sovereignty over the territory and demands that it should not be treated as an independent state. It\u2019s possible that this geopolitical obstacle led to the alleged delay.)\\nDid this matter? Almost certainly; with cases doubling every two or three days, we will never know what might have been different with an extra couple of weeks of warning. It\u2019s clear that many leaders took a while to appreciate the potential gravity of the threat. President Trump, for instance, announced in late February: \u201cIt\u2019s going to disappear. One day it\u2019s like a miracle, it will disappear.\u201d Four weeks later, with 1,300 Americans dead and more confirmed cases in the US than any other country, Trump was still talking hopefully about getting everybody to church at Easter.\\nAs I write, debates are raging. Can rapid testing, isolation and contact tracing contain outbreaks indefinitely, or merely delay their spread? Should we worry more about small indoor gatherings or large outdoor ones? Does closing schools help to prevent the spread of the virus, or do more harm as children go to stay with vulnerable grandparents? How much does wearing masks help? These and many other questions can be answered only by good data about who has been infected, and when.\\nBut in the early months of the pandemic, a vast number of infections were not being registered in official statistics, owing to a lack of tests. And the tests that were being conducted were giving a skewed picture, being focused on medical staff, critically ill patients, and \u2013 let\u2019s face it \u2013 rich, famous people. It took several months to build a picture of how many mild or asymptomatic cases there are, and hence how deadly the virus really is. As the death toll rose exponentially in March, doubling every two days in the UK, there was no time to wait and see. Leaders put economies into an induced coma \u2013 more than 3 million Americans filed jobless claims in a single week in late March, five times the previous record. The following week was even worse: more than 6.5m claims were filed. Were the potential health consequences really catastrophic enough to justify sweeping away so many people\u2019s incomes? It seemed so \u2013 but epidemiologists could only make their best guesses with very limited information.\\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more extraordinary illustration of how much we usually take accurate, systematically gathered numbers for granted. The statistics for a huge range of important issues that predate the coronavirus have been painstakingly assembled over the years by diligent statisticians, and often made available to download, free of charge, anywhere in the world. Yet we are spoiled by such luxury, casually dismissing \u201clies, damned lies and statistics\u201d. The case of Covid-19 reminds us how desperate the situation can become when the statistics simply aren\u2019t there.\\nWhen it comes to interpreting the world around us, we need to realise that our feelings can trump our expertise. This explains why we buy things we don\u2019t need, fall for the wrong kind of romantic partner, or vote for politicians who betray our trust. In particular, it explains why we so often buy into statistical claims that even a moment\u2019s thought would tell us cannot be true. Sometimes, we want to be fooled.\\nPsychologist Ziva Kunda found this effect in the lab, when she showed experimental subjects an article laying out the evidence that coffee or other sources of caffeine could increase the risk to women of developing breast cysts. Most people found the article pretty convincing. Women who drank a lot of coffee did not.\\nWe often find ways to dismiss evidence that we don\u2019t like. And the opposite is true, too: when evidence seems to support our preconceptions, we are less likely to look too closely for flaws. It is not easy to master our emotions while assessing information that matters to us, not least because our emotions can lead us astray in different directions.\\nWe don\u2019t need to become emotionless processors of numerical information \u2013 just noticing our emotions and taking them into account may often be enough to improve our judgment. Rather than requiring superhuman control of our emotions, we need simply to develop good habits. Ask yourself: how does this information make me feel? Do I feel vindicated or smug? Anxious, angry or afraid? Am I in denial, scrambling to find a reason to dismiss the claim?\\nIn the early days of the coronavirus epidemic, helpful-seeming misinformation spread even faster than the virus itself. One viral post \u2013 circulating on Facebook and email newsgroups \u2013 all-too-confidently explained how to distinguish between Covid-19 and a cold, reassured people that the virus was destroyed by warm weather, and incorrectly advised that iced water was to be avoided, while warm water kills any virus. The post, sometimes attributed to \u201cmy friend\u2019s uncle\u201d, sometimes to \u201cStanford hospital board\u201d or some blameless and uninvolved paediatrician, was occasionally accurate but generally speculative and misleading. But still people \u2013 normally sensible people \u2013 shared it again and again and again. Why? Because they wanted to help others. They felt confused, they saw apparently useful advice, and they felt impelled to share. That impulse was only human, and it was well-meaning \u2013 but it was not wise.\\nBefore I repeat any statistical claim, I first try to take note of how it makes me feel. It\u2019s not a foolproof method against tricking myself, but it\u2019s a habit that does little harm, and is sometimes a great deal of help. Our emotions are powerful. We can\u2019t make them vanish, and nor should we want to. But we can, and should, try to notice when they are clouding our judgment.\\nIn 1997, the economists Linda Babcock and George Loewenstein ran an experiment in which participants were given evidence from a real court case about a motorbike accident. They were then randomly assigned to play the role of plaintiff\u2019s attorney (arguing that the injured motorcyclist should receive $100,000 in damages) or defence attorney (arguing that the case should be dismissed or the damages should be low).\\nThe experimental subjects were given a financial incentive to argue their side of the case persuasively, and to reach an advantageous settlement with the other side. They were also given a separate financial incentive to accurately guess what the damages the judge in the real case had actually awarded. Their predictions should have been unrelated to their role-playing, but their judgment was strongly influenced by what they hoped would be true.\\nPsychologists call this \u201cmotivated reasoning\u201d. Motivated reasoning is thinking through a topic with the aim, conscious or unconscious, of reaching a particular kind of conclusion. In a football game, we see the fouls committed by the other team but overlook the sins of our own side. We are more likely to notice what we want to notice. Experts are not immune to motivated reasoning. Under some circumstances their expertise can even become a disadvantage. The French satirist Moli\u00e8re once wrote: \u201cA learned fool is more foolish than an ignorant one.\u201d Benjamin Franklin commented: \u201cSo convenient a thing is it to be a reasonable creature, since it enables us to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to.\u201d\\nModern social science agrees with Moli\u00e8re and Franklin: people with deeper expertise are better equipped to spot deception, but if they fall into the trap of motivated reasoning, they are able to muster more reasons to believe whatever they really wish to believe.\\nOne recent review of the evidence concluded that this tendency to evaluate evidence and test arguments in a way that is biased towards our own preconceptions is not only common, but just as common among intelligent people. Being smart or educated is no defence. In some circumstances, it may even be a weakness.\\nOne illustration of this is a study published in 2006 by two political scientists, Charles Taber and Milton Lodge. They wanted to examine the way Americans reasoned about controversial political issues. The two they chose were gun control and affirmative action.\\nTaber and Lodge asked their experimental participants to read a number of arguments on either side, and to evaluate the strength and weakness of each argument. One might hope that being asked to review these pros and cons might give people more of a shared appreciation of opposing viewpoints; instead, the new information pulled people further apart.\\nThis was because people mined the information they were given for ways to support their existing beliefs. When invited to search for more information, people would seek out data that backed their preconceived ideas. When invited to assess the strength of an opposing argument, they would spend considerable time thinking up ways to shoot it down.\\nThis isn\u2019t the only study to reach this sort of conclusion, but what\u2019s particularly intriguing about Taber and Lodge\u2019s experiment is that expertise made matters worse. More sophisticated participants in the experiment found more material to back up their preconceptions. More surprisingly, they found less material that contradicted them \u2013 as though they were using their expertise actively to avoid uncomfortable information. They produced more arguments in favour of their own views, and picked up more flaws in the other side\u2019s arguments. They were vastly better equipped to reach the conclusion they had wanted to reach all along.\\nOf all the emotional responses we might have, the most politically relevant are motivated by partisanship. People with a strong political affiliation want to be on the right side of things. We see a claim, and our response is immediately shaped by whether we believe \u201cthat\u2019s what people like me think\u201d.\\nConsider this claim about climate change: \u201cHuman activity is causing the Earth\u2019s climate to warm up, posing serious risks to our way of life.\u201d Many of us have an emotional reaction to a claim like that; it\u2019s not like a claim about the distance to Mars. Believing it or denying it is part of our identity; it says something about who we are, who our friends are, and the sort of world we want to live in. If I put a claim about climate change in a news headline, or in a graph designed to be shared on social media, it will attract attention and engagement not because it is true or false, but because of the way people feel about it.\\nIf you doubt this, ponder the findings of a Gallup poll conducted in 2015. It found a huge gap between how much Democrats and Republicans in the US worried about climate change. What rational reason could there be for that?\\nScientific evidence is scientific evidence. Our beliefs around climate change shouldn\u2019t skew left and right. But they do. This gap became wider the more education people had. Among those with no college education, 45% of Democrats and 23% of Republicans worried \u201ca great deal\u201d about climate change. Yet among those with a college education, the figures were 50% of Democrats and 8% of Republicans. A similar pattern holds if you measure scientific literacy: more scientifically literate Republicans and Democrats are further apart than those who know very little about science.\\nIf emotion didn\u2019t come into it, surely more education and more information would help people to come to an agreement about what the truth is \u2013 or at least, the current best theory? But giving people more information seems actively to polarise them on the question of climate change. This fact alone tells us how important our emotions are. People are straining to reach the conclusion that fits with their other beliefs and values \u2013 and the more they know, the more ammunition they have to reach the conclusion they hope to reach.\\nIn the case of climate change, there is an objective truth, even if we are unable to discern it with perfect certainty. But as you are one individual among nearly 8 billion on the planet, the environmental consequences of what you happen to think are irrelevant. With a handful of exceptions \u2013 say, if you\u2019re the president of China \u2013 climate change is going to take its course regardless of what you say or do. From a self-centred point of view, the practical cost of being wrong is close to zero. The social consequences of your beliefs, however, are real and immediate.\\nImagine that you\u2019re a barley farmer in Montana, and hot, dry summers are ruining your crop with increasing frequency. Climate change matters to you. And yet rural Montana is a conservative place, and the words \u201cclimate change\u201d are politically charged. Anyway, what can you personally do about it?\\nHere\u2019s how one farmer, Erik Somerfeld, threads that needle, as described by the journalist Ari LeVaux: \u201cIn the field, looking at his withering crop, Somerfeld was unequivocal about the cause of his damaged crop \u2013 \u2018climate change\u2019. But back at the bar, with his friends, his language changed. He dropped those taboo words in favour of \u2018erratic weather\u2019 and \u2018drier, hotter summers\u2019 \u2013 a not-uncommon conversational tactic in farm country these days.\u201d\\nIf Somerfeld lived in Portland, Oregon, or Brighton, East Sussex, he wouldn\u2019t need to be so circumspect at his local tavern \u2013 he\u2019d be likely to have friends who took climate change very seriously indeed. But then those friends would quickly ostracise someone else in the social group who went around loudly claiming that climate change is a Chinese hoax.\\nSo perhaps it is not so surprising after all to find educated Americans poles apart on the topic of climate change. Hundreds of thousands of years of human evolution have wired us to care deeply about fitting in with those around us. This helps to explain the findings of Taber and Lodge that better-informed people are actually more at risk of motivated reasoning on politically partisan topics: the more persuasively we can make the case for what our friends already believe, the more our friends will respect us.\\nIt\u2019s far easier to lead ourselves astray when the practical consequences of being wrong are small or non-existent, while the social consequences of being \u201cwrong\u201d are severe. It\u2019s no coincidence that this describes many controversies that divide along partisan lines.\\nIt\u2019s tempting to assume that motivated reasoning is just something that happens to other people. I have political principles; you\u2019re politically biased; he\u2019s a fringe conspiracy theorist. But we would be wiser to acknowledge that we all think with our hearts rather than our heads sometimes.\\nKris De Meyer, a neuroscientist at King\u2019s College, London, shows his students a message describing an environmental activist\u2019s problem with climate change denialism:\\nTo summarise the climate deniers\u2019 activities, I think we can say that:\\n(1) Their efforts have been aggressive while ours have been defensive.\\n(2) The deniers\u2019 activities are rather orderly \u2013 almost as if they had a plan working for them.\\nI think the denialist forces can be characterised as dedicated opportunists. They are quick to act and seem to be totally unprincipled in the type of information they use to attack the scientific community. There is no question, though, that we have been inept in getting our side of the story, good though it may be, across to the news media and the public.\\nThe students, all committed believers in climate change, outraged at the smokescreen laid down by the cynical and anti-scientific deniers, nod in recognition. Then De Meyer reveals the source of the text. It\u2019s not a recent email. It\u2019s taken, sometimes word for word, from an infamous internal memo written by a cigarette marketing executive in 1968. The memo is complaining not about \u201cclimate deniers\u201d but about \u201canti-cigarette forces\u201d, but otherwise, few changes were required.\\nYou can use the same language, the same arguments, and perhaps even have the same conviction that you\u2019re right, whether you\u2019re arguing (rightly) that climate change is real or (wrongly) that the cigarette-cancer link is not.\\n(Here\u2019s an example of this tendency that, for personal reasons, I can\u2019t help but be sensitive about. My left-leaning, environmentally conscious friends are justifiably critical of ad hominem attacks on climate scientists. You know the kind of thing: claims that scientists are inventing data because of their political biases, or because they\u2019re scrambling for funding from big government. In short, smearing the person rather than engaging with the evidence.\\nYet the same friends are happy to embrace and amplify the same kind of tactics when they are used to attack my fellow economists: that we are inventing data because of our political biases, or scrambling for funding from big business. I tried to point out the parallel to one thoughtful person, and got nowhere. She was completely unable to comprehend what I was talking about. I\u2019d call this a double standard, but that would be unfair \u2013 it would suggest that it was deliberate. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s an unconscious bias that\u2019s easy to see in others and very hard to see in ourselves.)\\nOur emotional reaction to a statistical or scientific claim isn\u2019t a side issue. Our emotions can, and often do, shape our beliefs more than any logic. We are capable of persuading ourselves to believe strange things, and to doubt solid evidence, in service of our political partisanship, our desire to keep drinking coffee, our unwillingness to face up to the reality of our HIV diagnosis, or any other cause that invokes an emotional response.\\nBut we shouldn\u2019t despair. We can learn to control our emotions \u2013 that is part of the process of growing up. The first simple step is to notice those emotions. When you see a statistical claim, pay attention to your own reaction. If you feel outrage, triumph, denial, pause for a moment. Then reflect. You don\u2019t need to be an emotionless robot, but you could and should think as well as feel.\\nMost of us do not actively wish to delude ourselves, even when that might be socially advantageous. We have motives to reach certain conclusions, but facts matter, too. Lots of people would like to be movie stars, billionaires or immune to hangovers, but very few people believe that they actually are. Wishful thinking has limits. The more we get into the habit of counting to three and noticing our knee-jerk reactions, the closer to the truth we are likely to get.\\nFor example, one survey, conducted by a team of academics, found that most people were perfectly able to distinguish serious journalism from fake news, and also agreed that it was important to amplify the truth, not lies. Yet the same people would happily share headlines such as \u201cOver 500 \u2018Migrant Caravaners\u2019 Arrested With Suicide Vests\u201d, because at the moment at which they clicked \u201cshare\u201d, they weren\u2019t stopping to think. They weren\u2019t thinking, \u201cIs this true?\u201d, and they weren\u2019t thinking, \u201cDo I think the truth is important?\u201d\\nInstead, as they skimmed the internet in that state of constant distraction that we all recognise, they were carried away with their emotions and their partisanship. The good news is that simply pausing for a moment to reflect was all it took to filter out a lot of the misinformation. It doesn\u2019t take much; we can all do it. All we need to do is acquire the habit of stopping to think.\\nInflammatory memes or tub-thumping speeches invite us to leap to the wrong conclusion without thinking. That\u2019s why we need to be calm. And that is also why so much persuasion is designed to arouse us \u2013 our lust, our desire, our sympathy or our anger. When was the last time Donald Trump, or for that matter Greenpeace, tweeted something designed to make you pause in calm reflection? Today\u2019s persuaders don\u2019t want you to stop and think. They want you to hurry up and feel. Don\u2019t be rushed.\\nThis is an edited extract from How to Make the World Add Up by Tim Harford, published by Little, Brown on 17 September.

Dutch water authorities are eyeing the UK as a possible destination for their sewage, after problems at an Amsterdam incineration company left them lacking disposal options.\\nA permit for the shipment of 27,500 tonnes of municipal sewage sludge was issued in February by the UK\u2019s Environment Agency, according to a document obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by Greenpeace\u2019s Unearthed investigative unit and seen by the Guardian.\\nThe sludge is listed as coming from the Amstel, Gooi and Vecht water board but the identity of the recipient in the UK has been redacted. The permit is valid until February.\\nIt is legal in the UK to use sewage sludge on farmland but it must be first treated and then applied under strict regulations. However, the Environment Agency has raised concerns that the regulations are not always followed.\\nIn November 2017, the Environment Agency had a report drawn up that listed potential problems for human health from using sewage on farmland, including the presence of pathogens such as E coli and salmonella, persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals and microplastics.\\nIt also found the supply chain handling sewage from its origins to its destination on fields was \u201cconvoluted\u201d, which raised the possibility of abuse of the regulations and contamination of farmland.\\nAlistair Boxall, a professor in environmental science at the University of York, said Dutch sewage was unlikely to be any worse than that from the UK, but the government was not doing enough to ensure that sewage spread on fields was safe.\\n\u201cThe government is doing very little to understand what harm sludge could be doing to humans \u2013 they don\u2019t have the data,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can ensure that you don\u2019t have harmful contaminants, then [using sewage] is a good thing.

Wastewater treatment plants can reduce but not eliminate all the antibiotics and resistant bacteria.\\n\u201cIf human sewage is spread on land growing food for human consumption, the possibility of antibiotic resistance being spread to people is greater than if it is spread on land producing other types of crops.\u201d\\nDr David Spurgeon, an ecotoxicological researcher at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said there were benefits to using sewage on farmland: \u201cIt is a way of returning nutrients to soil, which means we can reduce the use of mineral fertilisers, it helps build soil structure which helps avoid soil erosion, and it returns carbon to the soil which can help with meeting carbon reduction targets.\u201d\\nSewage treatment, though effective in removing many chemicals, was \u201cnot perfect, and there are some chemicals that can survive treatment\u201d and other contaminants and pathogens that could get into the food chain, he added.\\n\u201cSludge to land does need some management and that is why there is a code of practice to try to limit any issues,\u201d Spurgeon said.\\nJohn Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, said the government\u2019s oversight was not working, and pointed to cases in recent years where the rules had been violated, and concerns raised in the Environment Agency\u2019s 2017 report over enforcement.\\nSauven said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s sewage sludge supply chains are already full of shady middlemen and waste brokers getting their hands dirty exploiting its opacity and the resulting regulatory failings.

But after Europe cracked down on migration, its crew found themselves facing prosecution\\nAs patrol boats with flashing blue lights surrounded the Iuventa, just outside the port of Lampedusa on the evening of 1 August 2017, its crew were more annoyed than alarmed. For three days, the old fishing trawler, crewed by volunteers from the German NGO Jugend Rettet (Youth Rescue), had answered a string of requests from the Italian coastguard that to them made no sense. \u201cThis madness hopefully will soon be over,\u201d read a message sent from the ship\u2019s bridge to Jugend Rettet base camp shortly after 10pm.\\nIn the summer of 2017, two years on from the peak of Europe\u2019s refugee crisis, smugglers in Libya were still sending hundreds of people a day to sea in unsafe rubber boats, and the Iuventa\u2019s crew wanted to be where the action was. In a patch of sea just off the coast of north Africa, about a dozen NGO ships were searching for boats in distress \u2013 a direct challenge, as many of them saw it, to European governments that had scaled back state-run rescue efforts.\\nYet the Iuventa had been following instructions that drew it further away from the rescue zone and closer to Italian territorial waters. According to the ship\u2019s records, the Italian coastguard first told the crew to rendezvous with an Italian navy ship to collect two men found adrift at sea, and deliver them to another. The second ship never turned up. Then they were told to look for a blue and white fishing boat with 50 people on board, apparently foundering in the sea close to Lampedusa. As night fell on 1 August, after a day spent searching the waves in vain, a message came through: call off your search and proceed into port.\\nIt was the third time in a few months that the ship had been ordered into the harbour at Lampedusa. In just over a year, the Iuventa \u2013 crewed by a group of young, motivated people \u201cwho could not stand to see the situation in the Mediterranean any longer\u201d, as one put it to me \u2013 rescued more than 14,000 people. Most of these rescues were coordinated by the Italian coastguard, but the relationship was increasingly strained. The Iuventa\u2019s revolving crew of volunteers were outspoken critics of Europe\u2019s border policies, and the small, agile ship took more risks than some of the larger NGO vessels, sailing as close as possible to Libyan waters in order to be able to rescue people from unsafe boats sooner. As one Italian media outlet put it, the ship was \u201clike a sort of Berliner squat out in the middle of the sea \u2013 very well organised, radical and antagonistic\u201d.\\nAs the Iuventa entered the harbour of Lampedusa, the crew expected to be questioned briefly by police, as they had been on previous occasions, then allowed to get back to work. They were wrong. Within a few hours, their ship would be seized, marking the beginning of a long and still unresolved criminal investigation that leaves 10 humanitarian volunteers facing up to 20 years in prison.\\nIn the small hours of 2 August, while a crowd of journalists assembled on the quayside filmed and took photographs, detectives specialising in organised crime searched the Iuventa. The following morning, before the crew were even fully informed of the case against them, details were splashed across the Italian media. This \u201cGerman extremist NGO\u201d, as one newspaper later put it, was suspected of aiding illegal immigration \u2013 a crime in Italian law \u2013 by collaborating with Libyan smugglers. News outlets quoted liberally from a case file that showed the Iuventa had been under surveillance for months: there were even transcripts from a recording device placed on the ship\u2019s bridge. Police photographs, labelled and distributed to news agencies, purported to show several occasions on which the ship\u2019s crew had received migrants directly from boats driven by smugglers themselves.\\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything to hide, and we are looking forward to returning to the search and rescue zone one day, to fight for human rights,\u201d declared a member of the crew, who gave her name as Katrin, in a video statement released to the media. But these were explosive allegations, at a time when migration had become such a toxic issue that Italy\u2019s interior minister declared he \u201cfeared for the democratic integrity of the country\u201d. Italy\u2019s populist opposition parties led the charge against rescuers, accusing them of being taxi del mare, a \u201csea taxi\u201d service for migrants, while the government was pressuring NGOs to limit their operations. In the spring of 2017, two other NGOs had been investigated \u2013 but this was the first time a ship had been seized. Within months, under the looming threat of prosecution, NGOs were all but forced out of the Mediterranean.\\nToday, the Iuventa remains impounded, and 10 of its crew members are still waiting to find out if they will face trial. They deny ever working with smugglers, and have assembled documentary evidence that they say proves their innocence. More disturbingly, investigative journalists in Italy and elsewhere have unearthed evidence which appears to show that the surveillance began not with the Italian state, but with a spying plot involving a private security agency and the far-right political leader Matteo Salvini.\\nThe case is not yet over, but it has already marked a turning point: in just a few years, Europe has gone from saving lives at sea to attacking the people who do it. And it all began with the moment, in the words of the Italian author and migration specialist Annalisa Camilli, that \u201chumanitarians were transformed from angels at sea into dangerous collaborators with smugglers\u201d.\\nMore than three years since he last sailed a rescue mission, Dariush Beigui\u2019s mind still clicks into gear when he sees news of a boat in distress in the Mediterranean. The German skipper, a punk rock fan who pilots barges around the port of Hamburg for a living, mentally prepares to wake up his crewmates, to manoeuvre the Iuventa into position and scan the horizon with binoculars, ready to dispatch the ship\u2019s speedboat. But with the Iuventa sitting idle in the Sicilian port of Trapani, none of this is possible. \u201cThe hardest thing for me is to sit here watching social media, knowing that if I was there I could help,\u201d he told me. \u201cMaybe not to rescue everybody, but at least one person.\u201d\\nI met Beigui in Berlin in early 2020, along with two other members of the \u201cIuventa 10\u201d, Hendrik Simon and Sascha Girke. All three, now in their early 40s, volunteered to work on the Iuventa after Jugend Rettet launched in 2015 via a crowdfunding campaign. Many of the volunteers knew each other from past campaigns in environmentalist, antifascist and squatting movements, and they brought practical skills to the Mediterranean, along with a DIY ethos: Girke works as a paramedic in a town outside Berlin; Simon, an IT technician from Bremen, had driven speedboats for Greenpeace.\\nIn the summer of 2016, when the Iuventa first went to sea, the number of people crossing the central Mediterranean from Libya was at record levels. The people-smuggling trade, once tightly controlled by the former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on Europe\u2019s behalf, had boomed as the country collapsed into civil war. Since the overthrow of Gaddafi in 2011, tens of thousands of people a year \u2013 displaced by war, looking for work, or just desperate to get out of Libya \u2013 paid for passage on overcrowded inflatable dinghies that were pushed out to sea with only a few hours\u2019 worth of fuel. Unless given assistance, once they got into open water, these boats would sink. In 2016, more than 4,500 people drowned or went missing in the Mediterranean.\\nAn increasing proportion of the rescues were carried out by private organisations. By 2016, nine separate charities, from global aid agencies such as Save the Children and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) to smaller, newly formed groups, patrolled international waters close to Libya.\\nThe Iuventa quickly gained a reputation as one of the more daring rescue outfits. \u201cSaving people from drowning is always a humanitarian act,\u201d Simon told me, \u201c[but] I was going there as a political activist because I don\u2019t agree with European border policies.\u201d While the Iuventa put its speed and agility to use at sea, Jugend Rettet\u2019s volunteers held protest actions on land, calling for \u201cferries not Frontex\u201d \u2013 the provocative suggestion, with reference to the EU\u2019s border agency, that migrants should be allowed to travel freely.\\nYet 2016 was also the year that anti-refugee politics came to the fore in Europe and the US. Italy, where the majority of people rescued off the coast of Libya disembarked, was finding itself increasingly isolated. Three years earlier, in response to a growing number of shipwrecks on its southern border, Italy had taken the bold step of sending its navy out into international waters to search for boats in distress. The country\u2019s centre-left government gambled that the operation, which it called Mare Nostrum \u2013 \u201cour sea\u201d in Latin, after the ancient Roman name for the Mediterranean \u2013 would prompt its European neighbours into supporting the rescue effort, and helping look after the people rescued.\\nThe hoped-for support never arrived. Mare Nostrum was replaced by a far smaller EU operation, while responsibility for accommodating new arrivals remained with the country in which they disembarked. As Europe\u2019s increasingly panicked governments discussed how to reduce migration across the Mediterranean, Italy\u2019s neighbours began to seal off their land borders, preventing asylum seekers from continuing their journeys. By late 2016, around 200,000 people were stuck in Italy\u2019s slow-moving asylum system, management of which cost well over \u20ac3bn a year.\\nItalian coastguard officials began to take a less welcoming attitude to the NGO rescuers. \u201cThere was increasingly this delaying and questioning of our missions,\u201d said Girke, who volunteered multiple times as coordinator, either on board the Iuventa or at Jugend Rettet base camp on Malta. One point of contention seemed to be that the Iuventa would often transfer the people it picked up to better-equipped larger ships, so it could quickly return to the rescue zone. According to Girke, officials would often try to insist that the Iuventa took all the people it had rescued back to port \u2013 he suspects, to slow down its operations.\\nIn October 2016, three employees of a private security agency visited police in Trapani. The three had been working as security guards on board the Vos Hestia, a ship chartered by the UK aid organisation Save the Children, as a condition of the vessel\u2019s insurance. On 10 September, the Vos Hestia had crossed paths with the Iuventa during a rescue: a long, gruelling day of pulling people out of the water, in which six dinghies, each with more than a hundred people onboard, were adrift and sinking. The Iuventa\u2019s deck had become dangerously busy, and the Vos Hestia was one of several ships that arrived to help relieve the pressure.\\nOne of the security guards, Pietro Gallo, told police that shortly after the Vos Hestia took some of the Iuventa\u2019s passengers on board, he saw a dinghy heading away from the Iuventa, driven by two \u201cdark-skinned\u201d men. This, he said, \u201cmade us believe that the crew of the Iuventa had received migrants from the dinghy \u2026 which was returning to the [Libyan] coast with the smugglers onboard.\u201d The security guards assumed this meant that the Iuventa had collected migrants from smugglers by prior arrangement, rather than rescuing people whose lives were in danger.\\nHad the Iuventa\u2019s crew committed a crime? They say they had no contact with smugglers, pointing out that no evidence besides the security guards\u2019 testimony has been offered for the incident, and that several other vessels including an Irish navy ship were present at the scene. Nor, they say, was the alleged incident mentioned in the official Frontex report on that day\u2019s rescue. But after the allegations from security guards, prosecutors in Trapani authorised a surveillance operation, placing an undercover officer on Save the Children\u2019s ship. The officer would pose as a security guard alongside Gallo and his colleagues, watching the Iuventa from afar.\\nIn late November, the Iuventa entered port for the winter. By the end of the year, 181,436 people had been rescued from the central Mediterranean \u2013 and Italy appeared to welcome the contribution of the NGOs. At the end of the year, Girke told me, he attended a meeting in Rome with the Italian coastguard, to discuss how they could improve cooperation. \u201cThey were asking us to come back next year with bigger ships,\u201d he said.\\nIn the spring of 2017, six months after Gallo and his colleagues visited the police in Trapani, the prominent opposition politician Salvini made a startling claim on the TV talkshow In mezz\u2019ora (\u201cIn half an hour\u201d). In a heated debate with a representative of MSF, Salvini stated that he had seen a dossier by Italy\u2019s secret services about contact between people smugglers and some of the NGOs. \u201cThere are weapons and drugs onboard some of those ships,\u201d he added.\\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d asked the presenter, clearly taken aback.\\n\u201cI listen to the people who work on these boats,\u201d Salvini replied.\\nNo more details of the \u201cphantom dossier\u201d, as one media outlet described it, ever emerged. But Salvini had been in contact with the security guards on board the Vos Hestia. According to Gallo, in September 2016, the trio emailed AISE, the Italian secret service, with their suspicions about the Iuventa. When nobody there responded, said Gallo, they tried Salvini.\\n\u201c[Salvini] called back a few minutes later,\u201d Gallo told the newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano last year. \u201cHe wanted to meet us immediately, but we explained that we were about to embark, so he gave us the number of one of his contacts.\u201d According to Gallo, Salvini asked them to secretly document what they saw at sea, and pass the information on to his office via an intermediary.\\nSalvini has only partially confirmed the account, telling Il Fatto Quotidiano that he \u201cdisseminated\u201d some \u201chighly interesting\u201d information he received from one of Gallo\u2019s colleagues. What we do know, however, is that in the early months of 2017, Salvini transformed the fortunes of the party he leads, the Lega Nord, by helping bring the claim that NGO rescuers were collaborating with smugglers from the far-right fringe into the mainstream of political debate.\\nThe situation in the Mediterranean had become a rallying point for far-right activists across Europe. In December 2016, the Gefira Foundation, an obscure Dutch thinktank that purports to monitor the \u201cextinction\u201d of Europe\u2019s \u201cindigenous peoples\u201d, published a report in which it claimed that search and rescue was a \u201cscam\u201d in which \u201cNGOs, smugglers, the mafia, in cahoots with the European Union, have shipped thousands of illegals into Europe under the pretext of rescuing people\u201d. Within weeks, similar claims then began to circulate among far-right social media accounts.\\nThe narrative entered Italian politics, too. In February 2017, a Sicilian prosecutor called Carmelo Zuccaro announced a taskforce to investigate the NGOs, later claiming that smugglers and rescuers were colluding in order to destabilise the Italian economy. The following month, a hitherto unknown blogger, a 23-year-old media and communications student from Turin called Luca Donadel, posted a video to his Facebook page titled \u201cthe truth about migrants\u201d, which argued that NGOs were running a \u201ctaxi service\u201d for financial gain. Within days, Donadel\u2019s video went viral, shared by Salvini on his own social media accounts, and discussed on Striscia la notizia, a popular satirical TV show. Italy\u2019s other main opposition party, the Five Star Movement, joined the fray, and by April the accusation that the NGOs were \u201csea taxis\u201d \u2013 a phrase coined by the Five Star Movement\u2019s then leader, Luigi Di Maio, dominated the airwaves.\\nAs the moral panic intensified, state surveillance of the Iuventa stepped up a gear. In May, the ship was twice ordered to leave the rescue zone near Libya and dock at Lampedusa. Beigui, Girke and Simon now think that this is when the ship\u2019s bridge was bugged, although at the time they had no idea. \u201cMaybe it was a bit naive,\u201d said Simon, \u201cbut we were thinking like: \u2018Come on, we are rescuing people from drowning, what\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u2019\u201d\\nItaly\u2019s government, under pressure from both its domestic opposition and other European states to reduce migration, was turning against the rescuers. Marco Minniti, a former political head of the intelligence services, had taken over as interior minister at the end of 2016. Unlike his predecessors, Minniti was convinced that the priority was to prevent migrants from leaving Libya. He struck deals with several of the armed groups that controlled Libya, offering training to what remained of the country\u2019s coastguard \u2013 and negotiating with the militias that controlled smuggling in the coastal cities, to put a halt to migration.\\nAs summer 2017 approached, however, the numbers leaving Libya reached a new record. At the end of June, Minniti had a flight to Washington DC turned around when he heard the news that 12,000 people, rescued from the Mediterranean in the space of a few days, were making their way to Italian ports. After an emergency summit, in which Italian officials briefed the media that NGOs were to blame for encouraging people smugglers, Minniti unveiled a tough new code of conduct for rescue vessels. It included the demand that boats bring rescued migrants directly to port rather than transferring them to larger ships, a condition that would have severely limited the operations of smaller vessels like the Iuventa. Several NGOs, including Jugend Rettet, refused to sign the document in its original form; MSF said the code would lead to \u201cmore drownings\u201d.\\nBy mid-August, it seemed as though Minniti\u2019s agreements in Libya were finally taking effect. The number of people crossing the Mediterranean fell drastically. But as lurid details from the Iuventa case file spread throughout the media, the NGOs were now the centre of attention. \u201cThe NGOs don\u2019t give a toss about migrants, it\u2019s just the business opportunity of the moment,\u201d said \u201cLucio M\u201d, one of the security guards who worked with Gallo on board the Vos Hestia\\nA wide section of Italian society, and most of its politicians, had come to see the rescuers as a threat. Donations to the aid organisations plummeted, and in the second half of 2017 several of the major operators, including Save the Children and MSF, suspended or halted their rescue missions. Anti-immigration sentiment continued to rise \u2013 and by the autumn, even Pope Francis, a vocal supporter of migrants\u2019 rights and humanitarian rescue, appeared to give ground. In September, he stated that it was understandable for \u201ca country which has done so much, like Italy, to ask itself: can I host everyone? Do I have enough space?\u201d\\nAs a general election approached in early 2018, opposition politicians continued to attack the government on migration, with Salvini leading the charge. Support for the Lega soared: as recently as 2014 the party was supported by just 6% of the population; in 2018 it received 17%. The rightwing electoral alliance it formed part of topped the poll, with 37% of the vote. Entering coalition with the Five Star Movement, Salvini was appointed interior minister.\\nOne idea \u2013 that saving people from drowning only encourages others to make the journey \u2013 has come to dominate Europe\u2019s response to migration across the Mediterranean. Depending on your point of view, this is either hard-headed realism \u2013 or a terrifying, inhumane calculation. But the debate that surrounds this issue almost always obscures the perspectives of the people who attempt the journey.\\nIn October 2016, at around the same time that Gallo and his colleagues were talking to detectives in Trapani, a young man from Gambia called Malik saw what he calls \u201ca miracle out of nowhere\u201d. The 20-year-old was crammed with 130 others into a dinghy launched that morning from Libya, the weather had turned rough and the dinghy was starting to sink. As people around him said their prayers and prepared for death, Malik spotted a ship on the horizon. Taking a white shirt from a fellow passenger, he stood up and waved it furiously.\\n\u201cThey told us to stay calm, that we\u2019d all be rescued,\u201d said Malik when I spoke to him recently. \u201cThey gave us life vests and towed our boat all the way to the ship, and we got out one by one.\u201d Malik, who left his home in Gambia in 2014 after his father stabbed him during a drunken argument, was one of two people rescued by the Iuventa who I tracked down earlier this year. His journey to the Mediterranean had been brutal. He had borrowed money to pay for his passage across the Sahara desert, then worked on building sites in Libya, hoping to save up enough money for a journey to Europe. But he was kidnapped and held for ransom by one smuggling gang, then detained by another in a camp near the coast for seven months until his mother sent him money to buy his way out.\\nAbdulrahman, who left his home in Sierra Leone during an outbreak of Ebola and was just 16 when he was saved from a waterlogged dinghy in August 2016, had a similar story. He told me that by the time he left Libya, he was so desperate that he had spent five days hiding among trees and scavenging for food outside the port of Sabratha, looking for a way to sneak into the camp where smugglers were sending boats out to sea. \u201cIn Libya, trust me, there is slavery there \u2013 they treat people like animals,\u201d he said.\\nThe widespread abuse of migrants in Libya, above all of people from sub-Saharan Africa, goes back at least two decades: in 2005, an Italian parliamentary commission heard that people were being locked up \u201clike dogs\u201d in detention centres built by Gaddafi, partly as a result of requests from European governments to limit migration to their shores. Gaddafi is gone, but there is still a well-documented overlap between smugglers and officials in what remains of the Libyan state.\\nAs Maria Serrano, a migration researcher for Amnesty, put it to me: \u201cNGOs don\u2019t only save lives at sea, they monitor what is happening, and what the Iuventa and others were doing was bearing witness to the awful violations in Libya by trying to assist the survivors.\u201d\\nIn June 2018, Italian prosecutors officially named 10 Iuventa crew members as suspects. In an attempt to clear their name, the volunteers commissioned an investigation by the London-based researchers Forensic Architecture. Using geolocation techniques, and the Iuventa\u2019s own archive of pictures and video footage, Forensic Architecture discovered what they say are serious discrepancies in the case file. In one instance, from June 2017, Italian authorities say an empty dinghy was being towed by Iuventa crew members back towards Libya. But analysis of video footage shot from another rescue ship, along with wind patterns, suggests that it was being towed in the opposite direction, the crew say in order to be destroyed. In another, from the same day, footage examined by Forensic Architecture suggests that two men seen watching a rescue take place from a distance are \u201cengine fishers\u201d \u2013 people who follow migrant boats in order to salvage the parts \u2013 rather than smugglers, as the authorities claim.\\nBy this time, NGO rescuers had almost completely vanished from the central Mediterranean. Once in his post as interior minister, Salvini engineered a series of standoffs in which he prevented rescue ships from docking in Italy, leaving vessels with hundreds of migrants on board trapped at sea for days. \u201cThese jackals put the lives of immigrants at risk,\u201d Salvini tweeted during one such episode. \u201cWill they also go unpunished?\u201d Now back in opposition, after his governing coalition collapsed last year, Salvini is facing a possible criminal trial of his own. This February, the Italian senate voted to strip him of parliamentary immunity and allow magistrates in Sicily to try him for kidnapping, over an incident in which he prevented 131 migrants from disembarking.\\nAccording to Matteo Villa, a migration researcher at the Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI), a leading Italian thinktank, Salvini\u2019s actions may have been extreme, but he was \u201cexpressing the sentiments of all EU governments at the time\u201d. An internal report by the EU border agency Frontex, leaked to the media in December 2016, stated that NGO rescuers acted as an unwitting \u201cpull factor\u201d on migration across the Mediterranean sea.\\nYet Villa\u2019s own research suggests this is a mistaken premise. A recent study of migration patterns from Libya between 2014 and 2019, co-authored with Eugenio Cusumano and published by the European University Institute, found \u201cno relationship between the presence of NGOs at sea and the number of migrants leaving Libyan shores\u201d. Instead, departures rose or fell with the weather, or due to political conditions in Libya itself. But in the absence of larger-scale rescue operations, the proportion of people who die has increased. Even though the number of crossings has fallen drastically, still 750 people drowned or went missing last year.\\nWhen I spoke to Malik and Abdulrahman, it was almost four years since they had encountered the Iuventa. Abdulrahman now lives in Germany, where his claim for asylum was granted, and is doing an engineering apprenticeship. \u201cI was very angry to hear that the people who saved our lives are now having problems,\u201d he told me. Malik, meanwhile, is living in a reception centre near Naples, still waiting for a decision on his asylum claim. \u201cI knew what was happening in the Mediterranean and I made a gamble out of it,\u201d he said. Abdulrahman and Malik\u2019s fortunes had diverged \u2013 but they were both alive.\\nLast year, Pietro Gallo, the security guard whose actions helped trigger the surveillance of the Iuventa, broke his silence about the affair. \u201cI never witnessed the NGOs collaborating with traffickers,\u201d he told a reporter from the German newspaper Die Zeit. \u201cThat was always just a hunch. We put two and two together.\u201d Gallo claimed he hadn\u2019t intended for rescuers to be forced out of the Mediterranean, only that he thought Salvini would use his position \u201cto work out a humanitarian solution on a European level\u201d.\\nIn late 2019, a resolution calling for the EU to improve its search-and-rescue operations was narrowly defeated in the European parliament by an alliance of far-right and conservative parties. Ursula von der Leyen, the centre-right president of the European commission \u2013 the EU\u2019s executive branch \u2013 has promised a \u201chuman and humane\u201d approach in the commission\u2019s new migration pact, a document that will set the course of policy over the next few years. But Von der Leyen began her tenure last year by renaming her head of migration \u201ccommissioner for protecting the European way of life\u201d, wording that was condemned for its resemblance to far-right propaganda, and quickly changed.\\nAt the EU\u2019s land and sea borders, reports describe the violent expulsion of refugees and other vulnerable migrants: this summer, Greece was accused of setting people adrift in the Aegean, while Italy and Malta have both tried to close their ports to rescued migrants, citing the coronavirus pandemic. It\u2019s the migrants who most often get caught at the sharp end, but as governments toughen their border policies, volunteers who step in to help can find themselves treated as criminals. A recent report by Amnesty International found that since 2015, more than 150 people have been investigated or prosecuted in Europe for offering help to migrants.\\nIn Italy, since the spring of 2017, 16 separate criminal investigations have been opened into NGO rescue ships. Today, the handful of NGOs that still operate face long battles with the authorities to be allowed into port, and their vessels are still sometimes impounded: on 21 September, a ship belonging to the German NGO Sea-Watch was held in the port of Palermo, for issues including \u201chaving too many lifejackets on board\u201d, the fifth time a rescue vessel has been seized.\\nYet none of the criminal cases have so far come to trial \u2013 even though, in the case of the Iuventa, which is now the longest-running active investigation, it has been more than three years since the ship was seized. Prosecutors have yet to decide whether they will bring charges, pending the result of a forensic search of the crew\u2019s computers and phones. In the meantime, the Iuventa 10 are patiently trying to clear their name \u2013 and get their ship back.\\n\u201cWe never thought we were a solution to the problem,\u201d Girke told me when I spoke to him earlier this year. \u201cThe question for us was: how can we empower people on the move to resist, to end their own suffering? And the very first step was to not let them die.\u201d\\nFollow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.\\nThis article was amended on 24 September 2020.

Once, it would have been too remote to receive messages and yet here I was, laughing at the Sub Pop Records baseball cap that fixed him temporally and culturally. Will had wanted to be free, free to do what he wanted to do. And he had wanted to get loaded and have a good time. But Will, a better man than I, discovered a conscience. And now he was watching ice melt.\\nWill had been the first person to tell me about climate change, one long whiskey night in 1986, but the idea that the world was warming was absurd, just like his claim that one day we would piggyback on a worldwide military computer network to communicate face to face.

I was interested in William\u2019s position. \u201cWell, Extinction Rebellion is of course right to be extremely alarmed,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I suppose, philosophically, it might be worth your clarifying the distinction between a criminal action and a moral one.\u201d William allowed me to answer him in one long stream-of-consciousness rant, a skill honed through 30 years of echo-chamber leftwing standup.\\n\u201cYou\u2019re right of course, Will,\u201d I began. \u201cBut the verified crimes of Boris Johnson himself are many and varied and range from the irrelevant to the indefensible. He claims to have been arrested for plant-pot related restaurant vandalism while a student member of an elite restaurant vandalism society; was sacked from the Times for inventing quotes impugning the 13th-century nobleman Piers Gaveston; agreed to find his friend Darius Guppy the address of a journalist the convicted fraudster wanted to give \u201ca couple of black eyes and a cracked rib\u201d; used cocaine, though claims he imbibed with the lack of accuracy or care typical of his approach to politics; accrued multiple parking fines while reviewing cars for the monthly sex-gadgets journal GQ; built an ostentatious shed on his balcony without planning permission, making his Islington neighbours choke on their Fair Trade LGBTQIA hessian duffel-coat espadrille dinner-party muesli; used discreet water sprayers to suppress air pollution levels around monitoring stations in the run-up to the London 2012 Olympics, inadvertently contributing to the long-term critical health problems of thousands of vulnerable children; failed to declare a conflict of interest regarding his friendship with a pole-dancing technology instructor; lied about Turkish accession to the EU; lied on a bus about EU savings that could be transferred to the NHS; lied about an affair and so was dismissed from the post of shadow arts minister; lied about public support for a no-deal Brexit and so was censured by the Independent Press Standards Organisation in April 2019; failed nine times to declare his full earnings from the Daily Telegraph when he should have done, in breach of ministerial codes; lied about the reasons for not singing Rule, Britannia! at the Proms; lied by colluding in the distribution of undated images of al fresco long-hair dining to shore up the perceived stability of his relationship with Carrie Symonds; and lied to the Queen to unlawfully prorogue parliament. And yet here is Boris Pot-Crime Gaveston-Crime Address-Crime Cocaine-Crime Parking-Crime Shed-Crime Pollution-Crime Pole-Crime Turkish-Crime Bus-Crime Affair-Crime No-Deal-Crime Telegraph-Crime Proms-Crime Hair-Crime Queen-Crime Johnson, asking the Home Office to reclassify Extinction Rebellion as a \u201ccriminal\u201d organisation. And Boris Johnson calling Extinction Rebellion a criminal organisation is the pot calling the kettle black. And that pot had probably been thrown through the window of an Oxford restaurant in the 1980s anyway. Or been smoked. Or something. And the kettle isn\u2019t called \u201cblack\u201d. It is called a \u201cpicaninny\u201d. Yes! That\u2019s it!! Boris Johnson is the pot that has been thrown through a restaurant window or smoked, calling the kettle a picaninny. Let\u2019s see that sentence trending on Twitter! Could a rightwing comedian have thought of that? No! That is why I was called \u201cThe World\u2019s Greatest Living Standup\u201d by the reputable and honest Times newspaper in 2018. And you\u2019re watching ice melt in a wilderness!!\u201d\\n\u201cOK, Tiger, petty, personality-driven political point-scoring is too trivial a framing device for this debate. Let\u2019s make this more of a Socratic dialogue and less of an ego trip,\u201d said Will, harshing my buzz. \u201cCritics will claim that Extinction Rebellion\u2019s actions strike at the democratic notion of a free press. But from a moral perspective, when rising temperatures have destroyed our world as we know it, perhaps the cockroaches that inherit the planet will fashion from their stinking dung enormous reverential statues of the heroic Extinction Rebellion \u2018criminals\u2019 that tried to save us from ourselves.\u201d\\n\u201cYes, Will,\u201d I agreed, sarcastically, \u201cbut the man who reviewed filth-producing cars for a filthy magazine and then left them lying around abandoned before going off to waste the Earth\u2019s resources on illegal sheds while hiding behind the human shield of his puffin-cherishing environmentalist partner, will be rightly identified as a real \u201ccriminal\u201d of the Anthropocene period. And slowly, the cockroaches will roll Boris Johnson\u2019s statue off the crumbling quay, into the last dry puddle of the still boiling ocean et cetera, et cetera. Look, do I sign this letter or what?\u201d But there was no answer. Through the window of his cabin I could see Will outside on the beach, open mouthed, head in hands. In the time we had been goofing around, arguing the point like student showoffs, another vast shelf of ice had slipped silently into the sea.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e4d66fa9c2d8d4a0b82279f75cd4c24103bee45/0_78_1969_1182/master/1969.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Illustration by David Foldvari."]], "author": ["Stewart Lee"], "date": "2020-09-13"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/02/amazon-fires-brazil-rainforest-bolsonaro-destruction": {"title": "Amazon tragedy repeats itself as Brazil rainforest goes up in smoke", "subtitle": null, "text": "The vast rainforest is experiencing a repeat of last year\u2019s devastating fires and critics say Bolsonaro bears ultimate responsibility\\nJair Bolsonaro smiles down from a propaganda billboard at the entrance to this scruffy Amazon outpost, welcoming travelers to his \u201croute to development\u201d.\\nBut 20 months into Bolsonaro\u2019s presidency \u2013 and a year after a devastating outbreak of Amazon fires caused global outrage \u2013 the fires are back, and many fear Brazil\u2019s leader is instead steering his country towards environmental ruin.\\nDuring a two-hour monitoring flight through the skies around Novo Progresso the Guardian saw giant columns of white and grey smoke rising from supposedly protected forests below.\\nElsewhere, illegal goldmines could be seen within the Ba\u00fa indigenous territory \u2013 a chaotic tapestry of muddy pools and makeshift encampments where pristine forest once stood.

In August it detected more than 7,600 fires in Amazonas \u2013 one of nine states making up the Brazilian Amazon \u2013 the highest number since 1998 and nearly 1,000 more than last year.

And unfortunately it was entirely expected because the president was elected thanks to his anti-environment rhetoric \u2013 and now he is making good on those promises,\u201d said Carlos Rittl, a Brazilian environmentalist who works at Germany\u2019s Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies.\\n\u201cThe feeling is one of desolation,\u201d Rittl said, adding: \u201c2020 is going to be a terrible year.\u201d\\nBatista compared Bolsonaro\u2019s approach to the forest fires to his denialist handling of coronavirus, which has now killed more than 120,000 Brazilians. The far-right populist hoped to deny satellite images and science and project \u201can air of normality\u201d to the world \u201cjust as he did with Covid-19\u201d. \u201cUnfortunately, this simply isn\u2019t true.\u201d\\nThe former Ibama official was similarly pessimistic, claiming its operations were \u201ccompletely paralyzed\u201d and Brazil\u2019s environmental policies in tatters.

Within seconds they were lifted \u2013 or dragged \u2013 back to the pavement. The protest was over almost before it had begun and minutes later the prime minister\u2019s motorcade sped past unhindered.\\nThe action was one of scores of Extinction Rebellion non-violent civil disobedience protests \u2013 from a migrant justice demonstration outside the Home Office to blockading a slaughterhouse in Manchester \u2013 that have been taking place in major cities across the UK over the past two weeks to try to highlight the escalating climate crisis.\\nUnlike XR\u2019s previous rebellions in April and October last year, which saw thousands of people blockade large parts of central London day after day, protesters have focused on what they say are some of the the key actors driving the climate crisis \u2013 from the UK government to rightwing thinktanks and media companies, fossil fuel corporations to big infrastructure projects.\\nNumbers on the streets have been smaller \u2013 mainly because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 and the more targeted actions have caused neither the same level of disruption or gripped the public imagination to the same extent as they did last year.\\nHowever, XR organiser say its more focused campaign have given the movement a renewed sense of purpose.\\n\u201cIn the past we have raised a very generalised alarm which needed doing,\u201d said Clare Farrell of XR. \u201cBut there are things that are structurally important to understand about the causal reality of this crisis and I think we have done a fantastic job of drawing attention to them.\u201d\\nA key target of the protests was rightwing thinktanks and lobbying organisations that campaigners say play a crucial role in downplaying the climate crisis. Last week, XR activists joined novelists, poets and playwrights, including Mark Rylance and Zadie Smith, to demonstrate outside 55 Tufton Street in London, a venue infamous for hosting meetings of thinktanks and lobbying outfits linked to climate science denial and the oil industry.\\nA few days later, XR upped the ante, using trucks and bamboo scaffolds to block roads outside the printing presses of a raft of national newspapers \u2013 including the Sun, Times, Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday \u2013 with banners reading \u201cFree The Truth\u201d and \u201c5 Crooks Control Our News\u201d.\\nThe action not only blocked the printing presses of those newspapers, it also had a knock on effect of the distribution of other titles, including the Guardian. For the first time since the protests began, XR was high up the news agenda and once again the subject of heated public debate. The nature and target of the protests drew stinging criticism, with the prime minister and home secretary Priti Patel accusing XR of undermining democracy and a free press, and branding the group \u201ccriminals\u201d and a threat to the British way of life. In anonymous briefings the government even floated the idea of classing XR as an \u201corganised crime group\u201d.\\nAnd it was not just the Conservative party who criticised the action. Labour leader Keir Starmer said the blockade was \u201can attack on the cornerstone of democracy\u201d and the newspapers themselves, as well as media commentators and the Society of Editors, have since lined up to denounce the group.\\nBut for XR \u2013 and many in the wider environment movement \u2013 the action was deemed legitimate and necessary. They argued that much of the rightwing press, owned by a handful of billionaires, have played a key role in downplaying the climate crisis and undermining the structural changes needed to address it \u2013 that much of our press, in fact, is far from free.\\nAngus Satow, co-founder of the leftwing grassroots environmental group Labour for a Green New Deal, told the Guardian: \u201cWe desperately need groups like XR to highlight the political and economic actors that are driving this climate crisis. Many of the big ideas that were being discussed in relation to the climate crisis when the coronavirus hit seem to have been forgotten by politicians who are scrabbling to get us back to a normal that will be disastrous.\\n\u201cWe need groups like XR and the school strike movement to keep the pressure on and drive the climate crisis up the agenda.\u201d\\nZo\u00eb Blackler, a journalist working in XR\u2019s media team, said that despite the backlash from the establishment, the protest at the print works had been \u201creally galvanising across the movement\u201d.\\nShe said that although it had brought a huge amount of negative media coverage \u2013 with journalists trawling through the private lives of those involved, contacting former members for information on the group and approaching funders to disown them \u2013 she hoped it had also opened up a space for important conversations about the climate crisis and media ownership.\\n\u201cI can imagine there are conversations going on in newsrooms now about how they cover the climate and ecological crisis ... I hope when things have settled down this will lead to real progress in the quality of the reporting.\u201d\\nA criticism of XR ahead of its latest rebellion, especially from black and ethnic minority groups, was that its tactic of encouraging mass arrests ignored the reality of police racism, and effectively made the protests the preserve of privileged white people.\\nThe September protests aimed to be different, with XR working more closely with other groups and recognising the connections between structural racism, inequality and the climate crisis.\\nDaze Aghaji, who has been involved with XR since the beginning of last year, said the last two weeks had been the most diverse rebellion so far.\\n\u201cThere is still loads of work to do on this but we are learning \u2026 we are having good conversations with other groups, listening and making sure we are much better at making sure everyone knows they are welcomed.\u201d\\nBlack environmental activists outside of XR say the movement was making some progress but urged the media to highlight the work of other grassroots groups who are focusing on climate and racial justice.\\nAs XR wound up its latest rebellion on Thursday, it was already preparing its next campaign. According to those involved it will take the form of a \u201cMoney Strike\u201d \u2013 with people encouraged to withhold debt or taxes from institutions deemed to be fuelling not only the climate crisis but also structural racism and wider inequality.\\nLaunched less than two years ago, the group is still thinking big. Its actions over the past two weeks did not capture the public imagination in the way it had done in April last year. By attacking the rightwing media, they have made a formidable enemy \u2013 and according to some critics, may have distracted the press and the public from their core message about the climate crisis.\\nBut as evidence of the climate and ecological emergency mounts \u2013 from melting glaciers in the Antarctic to wildfires in California and the widespread destruction of wildlife and the natural world \u2013 XR still believes it has a crucial role to play.\\nAs Boris Johnson stood up in parliament for PMQs on Wednesday, 92-year-old Arnold Pease, from Manchester, was being arrested outside for his part in the protests.\\nAs he was being led away by police, Pease said: \u201cWe\u2019re here to continue holding them to account.
