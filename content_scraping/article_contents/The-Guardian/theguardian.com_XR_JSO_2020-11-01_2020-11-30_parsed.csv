For the first time since the protests began, XR was high up the news agenda and once again the subject of heated public debate. The nature and target of the protests drew stinging criticism, with the prime minister and home secretary Priti Patel accusing XR of undermining democracy and a free press, and branding the group “criminals” and a threat to the British way of life. In anonymous briefings the government even floated the idea of classing XR as an “organised crime group”.', 'And it was not just the Conservative party who criticised the action. Labour leader Keir Starmer said the blockade was “an attack on the cornerstone of democracy” and the newspapers themselves, as well as media commentators and the Society of Editors, have since lined up to denounce the group.', 'But for XR – and many in the wider environment movement – the action was deemed legitimate and necessary. They argued that much of the rightwing press, owned by a handful of billionaires, have played a key role in downplaying the climate crisis and undermining the structural changes needed to address it – that much of our press, in fact, is far from free.', 'Angus Satow, co-founder of the leftwing grassroots environmental group Labour for a Green New Deal, told the Guardian: “We desperately need groups like XR to highlight the political and economic actors that are driving this climate crisis.

I hope when things have settled down this will lead to real progress in the quality of the reporting.”', 'A criticism of XR ahead of its latest rebellion, especially from black and ethnic minority groups, was that its tactic of encouraging mass arrests ignored the reality of police racism, and effectively made the protests the preserve of privileged white people.', 'The September protests aimed to be different, with XR working more closely with other groups and recognising the connections between structural racism, inequality and the climate crisis.', 'Daze Aghaji, who has been involved with XR since the beginning of last year, said the last two weeks had been the most diverse rebellion so far.', '“There is still loads of work to do on this but we are learning … we are having good conversations with other groups, listening and making sure we are much better at making sure everyone knows they are welcomed.”', 'Black environmental activists outside of XR say the movement was making some progress but urged the media to highlight the work of other grassroots groups who are focusing on climate and racial justice.', 'As XR wound up its latest rebellion on Thursday, it was already preparing its next campaign.

Its actions over the past two weeks did not capture the public imagination in the way it had done in April last year. By attacking the rightwing media, they have made a formidable enemy – and according to some critics, may have distracted the press and the public from their core message about the climate crisis.', 'But as evidence of the climate and ecological emergency mounts – from melting glaciers in the Antarctic to wildfires in California and the widespread destruction of wildlife and the natural world – XR still believes it has a crucial role to play.', 'As Boris Johnson stood up in parliament for PMQs on Wednesday, 92-year-old Arnold Pease, from Manchester, was being arrested outside for his part in the protests.', 'As he was being led away by police, Pease said: “We’re here to continue holding them to account.

Seeing Boris Johnson ritually dismembered in parliament might make us feel better, but nothing changes. He still has an 80-seat majority, though less than 30% of the electorate voted for the Conservatives. We are reduced, for five long years, to spectators.', 'Our system allows the victorious government a mandate to do what it likes between elections, without further reference to the people. As we have seen, this can include breaking international law, suspending parliament, curtailing the judiciary, politicising the civil service, attacking the Electoral Commission and invoking royal prerogative powers to make policy without anyone’s consent. This is not democracy, but a parody of democracy.', 'By contrast to our five-yearly vote, capital can respond to government policy every second, withdrawing its consent with catastrophic consequences if it doesn’t like its drift. There’s a massive imbalance of power here. The voting power of capital, with modern trading technologies, has advanced by leaps and bounds. Electoral power is trapped in the age of the quill pen.', 'The problem, in other words, is not just Johnson. The problem is the UK’s political system, which presents an open invitation for autocratic behaviour. In the past, people warned that a ruthless operator could make hay with this system. Well, that moment has come.', 'Labour has long been part of the problem, refusing to contemplate even a change to our preposterous first-past-the-post elections, let alone any wider surrender of power. And it is tragic to watch it now, still playing by the old rules. These state that a party should not show its hand until a few months before the election. That’s four years away, and the power grab is happening now. We urgently need a stirring alternative vision, a call to democratic arms. Instead, we get forensic dissections of particular government policies: admirably done, but unmatched to the moment.', 'At moments like this, old parties flounder. New ideas arise outside the system, and effective opposition takes place on the street. Of course, this is difficult now, as there are good public health reasons not to gather in large numbers, and we can expect the government to exploit them. But civil disobedience is ever-inventive, constantly developing new tactics in response to attempts to shut it down.', 'We saw some of these in Extinction Rebellion’s latest week of protests, and we saw something else too: its emergence as a broad oppositional movement, taking on the billionaire press, the lobbyists, the banks and other bastions of power, that are not usually associated with the extinction and climate crises, but are fundamental to them. From the beginning, XR has been both an environmental movement and a democracy movement: participatory politics, in the form of citizens’ assemblies, has been one of its key demands.', 'Like the suffragettes and the civil rights movement, it was excoriated for threatening “our way of life”. Almost all democratic advances, everywhere, have been secured by people who were branded “anarchists” and “criminals”.', 'The democratic and environmental crises have the same roots: our exclusion, for several years at a time, from meaningful politics. In some places, particularly Ireland, Iceland, France, Taiwan, British Columbia, Ontario and several Spanish and Brazilian cities, a host of fascinating experiments with new democratic forms has been taking place: constitutional conventions, citizens’ assemblies, community development, digital deliberation and participatory budgeting. They are designed to give people a voice between elections, tempering representative democracy, allowing them to refine their choices.', 'The UK pays lip service to these innovations. Last week the citizens’ assembly on climate, convened by parliament, published its findings, which included suggestions such as taxing frequent fliers, getting rid of SUVs and eating less red meat. But there are no obvious means by which they can be adopted by the government. In Scotland, all local authorities allow residents to set part of their budgets, though so far, it’s very small: just 1% of the money allocated by central government.', 'Unless the results of participatory democracy can be translated into policy, and unless it operates at a meaningful scale, it generates cynicism and disillusion. But as the processes in Ireland, Madrid and in some Brazilian cities have shown, when people are allowed to make big and frequent decisions, the results can be transformative. Alienated, polarised populations come together to identify and solve their common problems. Democracy becomes a lived reality.', 'Nowhere has participatory politics yet been allowed to fulfil its promise. There is no principled or technical reason why the majority of a municipal or national budget should not be set through public deliberation, following techniques pioneered in the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre. There is no principled or technical reason why the monthly voting process for improving life in Reykjavik could not be applied at the national level, everywhere. The call for full-scale participatory democracy is as revolutionary as the call for the universal franchise was in the 19th century. What is needed is a vehicle similar in scale to the Chartist and suffragette movements.', 'There are precedents for environmental protests mutating into democratic revolutions: this is what helped precipitate the collapse of the Soviet Union. Our climate and extinction crises expose the failures of all quasi-democratic systems, and the blatant capture of ours by the power of money turns the UK into a global crucible.', 'In XR’s outrageous, reviled protests we see the beginnings of what could become a 21st-century democratic revolution. Through his incompetence, callousness and greed for power, Johnson has done us two favours: exposing the shallowness of our theatrical democracy, and creating a potential coalition ranging from hospital porters to supreme court judges.

In all three scenarios the report found that the use of oil in transport would reach a peak in the mid- to late 2020s due to the shift towards electric cars and hydrogen-powered vehicles.', 'Another factor dragging on the forecasts for oil demand in the coming decades are new measures to limit the production of plastic, which is manufactured using petrochemicals produced from fossil fuels, through more recycling and less single-use plastics.', 'The effect may be an upending of global energy market dynamics, according to BP. The report expects members of the Opec oil cartel, led by Saudi Arabia, to bear the brunt of the decline in demand while US shale rigs take a greater share of the global oil market over the next decade.

Now they’re campaigning against racism, climate breakdown and equality', 'In June, Simukai Chigudu stepped up on a plinth in front of thousands of people blocking the streets outside Oriel College in Oxford. The associate professor of African politics addressed the crowds inspired by Black Lives Matter and the anti-racism protests sweeping across the UK and around the world, catalysed by the killing of yet another black man at the hands of police in the US.', 'Chigudu told the crowds that, yes, he was angry – how could he not be? He is one of just an estimated seven black professors employed by the University of Oxford, an institution that has faced years of questioning over diversity and its treatment of students and staff of colour.', 'As a postgraduate student five years ago, he was one of the founding members of Rhodes Must Fall in Oxford, a major student-led protest arguing for the decolonisation of Oxford and calling for the removal of the statue of Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes, which stands outside Oriel College.', 'In early June, the world watched as protesters in Bristol knocked down the statue of slave trader Edward Colston. The energy spread to Oxford, sparking a resurgence of the campaign to bring down Rhodes.', '“When I stood up to speak and I was surveying the crowd, I could see the different eyes being cast on me. I saw a lot of people who didn’t have much to do with the university. It felt like there was this convergence of people, that an anti-racism project has to be far-reaching,” he says.', 'Yet five years prior, the Rhodes Must Fall in Oxford campaign had felt like a movement that would never spread past the city’s limestone walls. The activists who launched a campaign to decolonise the university’s curriculum and challenge its racist iconography, inspired by the University of Cape Town’s original Rhodes Must Fall campaign, were continuously challenged on their views.', 'Yet the pervasiveness of racism at the university was made startlingly apparent when, not long after the campaign began, the bar at an Oxford Union debate on the British Empire sold a cocktail named the “colonial comeback”, accompanied by images of black hands in chains.', 'After a leaked document in January 2016 warned the college would lose about £100m in donor gifts if Rhodes did fall, the movement lost momentum.', 'Yet though under the same name, this summer’s protest felt different. There was a realisation, Chigudu says, that “it felt like a city having a reckoning, rather than a closed matter for the university”.', 'This summer’s tsunami of activism has added weight to the role of students in protests and campaigns that go beyond the campus. Malaika Gangooly is starting her second year of journalism at City University of London, another institution that recently bowed to student pressure to remove the name of John Cass – the 18th-century merchant linked to the slave trade – from its business school.', 'She led the Black Lives Matter protests in her hometown of Chingford, and now plans to run for diversity officer at the students’ union. “People thought I was maybe too young to start in protests, and too heavily involved. But the younger you are, the better it is to get involved, and the more important it is. If it’s not worked in generations before us, then we’re the generation that has to try and make it work.”', 'These same arguments have been reproduced in the youth climate movement in the past two years. The urgency of the disaster has been pushed by young people, many of whom are university students. Their campus activism has led to radical divestment from fossil fuel campaigns, while students have played major roles in local branches of Extinction Rebellion or the youth climate strikes. In 2018, for example, two students at Sussex University were claimants on a significant climate change lawsuit against the UK government.', '“So much of the change that’s happening now is people my age at university. If we take it into our own hands then no one can complain about it,” says Gangooly.', 'Something in the atmosphere has changed. For Gangooly’s generation, it’s obvious that issues affecting students are mirrored in society: it is young people who will bear the brunt of the climate catastrophe; there is institutional racism at the universities that breed our future leaders.', '“[Recently] there’s been the circulation of many more ideas about how we might change society and how we deal with questions of equality, but also what that means in terms of a world in which there’s so much economic insecurity, in which there’s a looming climate catastrophe, and so on,” says Chigudu. “That’s partly contributed to the willingness of people to really rally around and protest, and for people to see the interconnections between racism, capitalism and climate catastrophe.”', 'This idea of students questioning their future on a mass scale echoes back to post-financial crisis Britain. In November, it will be a decade since tens of thousands of students occupied streets across the UK, protesting a steep rise in university fees and cuts to the Education Maintenance Allowance. Britain’s press was overrun with images of students occupying Millbank, clashes with police and placards repeating the slogan “No Future”.', 'It was one of the biggest mass movements of young people in British history, and “the first of a series of major mass movements to characterise the next five years, not just in Britain but around the world,” says Matthew Myers, a graduate student of History at the University of Oxford, pointing to movements such as Occupy and the Arab Spring that followed.', 'Though often discussed as a campaign against fee hikes, the student protests of 2010 addressed issues of austerity and inequality. “It was a very specific moment in time where young people were at the forefront. There was a sense of generational injustice,” says Myers, who participated in the 2010 protests and is the author of Student Revolt.', '“A whole generation in 2010 were very motivated by slogans of ‘no future’. They felt the future that they’d been promised – if they worked hard, got a good job, then they’d be able to achieve the level of economic stability and success which their parents had been promised – was no longer possible,” says Myers. “Students were simply the first in a long line of groups who were going to have to pay for the crisis, and pay for austerity.”', 'A decade on, it seems students are once again realising they will pay for other injustices, and they are now asking what their role is to make changes – particularly with race, climate and inequality.', 'But this resurgence of student activism will reverberate far beyond their own lives. “[It has] almost become more profound,” says Myers. “The student climate strikers are speaking as much as students as they are as human beings who are going to have to live on a planet which is entering climate catastrophe.”']",['Naomi Larsson Piñeda'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5ffce7ada9a9919e968ff66e41f2fd3c6c09040/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', '‘It felt like a city having a reckoning, rather than a closed matter for the university.’']]",

It is being marketed as a retrospective, a look back at his life and 60-years-plus career. But make no mistake about its true agenda: Attenborough is here to deliver a stark warning that time is ticking for the planet. It is a personal film – and political, too. There is emotion and urgency in that familiar soothing voice.

It must reduce rival centres of power – the judiciary, the civil service, academia, broadcasters, local government, civil society – to satellites of its own authority, controlled from the centre, deprived of independent action. But it must do this while claiming to act in the people’s name.', 'So it needs an apparatus of justification: arguments that can be fed through a sympathetic press and manufactured into outrage against its rivals. This is where the intellectual work of such a government is focused.', 'In the UK, Dominic Cummings is not the sole architect of this project: much of the intellectual landscaping has been outsourced. Since the 1950s, an infrastructure of persuasion has been built, whose purpose is to supplant civic power with the power of money. The model was developed by two fanatical disciples of Friedrich Hayek, the father of neoliberalism: Antony Fisher and Oliver Smedley. They knew it was essential to disguise their intentions. While founding the Institute of Economic Affairs, the first of the thinktanks whose purpose was to spread Hayek’s gospel, Smedley reminded Fisher it was “imperative that we should give no indication in our literature that we are working to educate the Public along certain lines … That is why the first draft [of our aims] is written in rather cagey terms.”', 'The institute, and the other lobby groups Fisher founded, honed the arguments that would be used to strip down the state, curtail public welfare and public protection, and restrict and undermine other forms of social cohesion, releasing the ultra-rich from the constraints of democracy. Unsurprisingly, some of the richest people on Earth poured cash into his project.', 'His groups translated Hayek’s ideas, seen by many as repulsive, into a new political common sense – producing the reframings and justifications on which Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan built their revolutions.', 'Others began to copy this model. Madsen Pirie, the founder of the Adam Smith Institute, describes in his autobiography how, using funds from 20 of the UK’s biggest companies, he helped to chart the course that Thatcher took. Every Saturday, while she was in opposition, staff from the Adam Smith Institute and the Institute of Economic Affairs sat down for lunch with Conservative party researchers, and leader writers and columnists from the Times and Telegraph, to plot out her rise to power. They “planned strategy for the week ahead”, and would “co-ordinate our activities to make us more effective collectively”. Pirie describes how he devised many of the policies that defined Thatcherism.', 'And elsewhere too, not least in the testimony of the Brexit campaign whistleblower Shahmir Sanni, there is evidence that these lobby groups coordinate their work, creating the impression that people in different places are spontaneously coming to the same conclusions. Several of them work from the same offices, in 55 and 57 Tufton Street, Westminster.', 'The lobby group that Boris Johnson’s government uses most is Policy Exchange. While it claims to be a neutral educational charity, it was founded in 2002 by the Conservative MPs Francis Maude and Archie Norman, and Nick Boles, who later also became a Tory MP. Its first chairman was Michael Gove. Its proposals and personnel have been adopted by the Conservative party ever since.', 'Policy Exchange has played an important role in shifting power away from rival institutions and into the prime minister’s office. For several years it has been building a case for curtailing the judiciary. It provided the ammunition for the government’s current attack on judicial review, which enables citizens to sue the government to uphold the law. This was the process transparency campaigner Gina Miller used: in 2016 to oblige Theresa May to seek parliamentary approval for triggering the Brexit process; and, last year, to overturn Boris Johnson’s suspension of parliament.', 'Policy Exchange calls such rulings “judicial overreach”. It claims they threaten the sovereignty of parliament and the separation of powers between government and judiciary. To my mind they do the opposite. The law is not whatever Boris Johnson says it is: it is legislation passed by parliament and interpreted by the courts. Both the Miller cases returned powers to parliament that prime ministers had seized. The government has now appointed a former Conservative minister, Lord Faulks, to examine judicial review, along the lines suggested by Policy Exchange.', 'This lobby group has called for the prime minister’s office to have greater powers “to develop and direct policy change” through the civil service, and to appoint leaders of public bodies whose “culture and values” align with government’s aims. It has led the public attacks on what it calls the “chilling effects” of leftwing views in academia. Its recent report on academic freedom was brilliantly eviscerated in the Guardian by Jonathan Portes, who found it riddled with basic statistical errors and mistaken assumptions. What purports to be a campaign for intellectual freedom looks more like a McCarthyite attempt to suppress left-leaning ideas. It’s an effective weapon in the government’s gathering culture war.', 'Policy Exchange’s proposals for changing the planning system, which involve a massive removal of power from local authorities, have been adopted wholesale by the government. One of the authors of this scheme, Jack Airey, has moved from the thinktank to Downing Street, as a special adviser.', 'Last year, Policy Exchange published a polemic that claimed Extinction Rebellion is led by dangerous extremists. As usual, it was widely covered by the media. Less discussed was the report that the lobby group has received funding from the power company Drax, the trade association Energy UK, and the gas companies E.ON and Cadent, whose fossil-fuel investments are threatened by environmental activism. These are among the few funders whose identities we know. Policy Exchange is listed by Who Funds You? as among the UK’s most opaque thinktanks. It might seem remarkable that without having to reveal its funders, while promoting shifts that could harm civil society, Policy Exchange remains a registered charity.', 'Conservative governments clearly attach great importance to the way charities are overseen. In 2018, a parliamentary committee sent the government an unprecedented letter, pointing out that the government’s preferred candidate as chair of the Charity Commission, the former Tory minister Baroness Stowell, was “unable to demonstrate … any real insight, knowledge or vision”; could not be seen as neutral; and had failed to withstand the committee’s scrutiny. The government appointed her anyway, and she remains chair today.', 'By such means, political life is steadily undermined, until little remains but authority and obedience to the prime minister. Without strong civic institutions, society loses its power. From the point of view of global capital, that’s mission accomplished.

What might have seemed a relatively dry idea on paper – a trawl through 200-year-old art – turned out to be thumpingly relevant to almost every aspect of modern life, even down to last week’s Extinction Rebellion protests and migrant landings.', 'Because what the Romantics did was nothing less than change our way of thinking about the world. For good and, sometimes, for ill. Blake, Shelley, Delacroix, Wollstonecraft, Chopin and the rest of the gang, Schama argued with cogency, persuasion and some great phrasemaking, gave us little less than the very ideas of democracy, of national belonging (something of a double-edged sword), of obsession with the self, even interest in nature… and “we still think with their mind, we feel with their emotional heartbeat”.', 'Think you’re the first creative type to dare to put politics into your wilfully controversial art? Delacroix and Géricault got there way first, the latter with his astonishing Raft of the Medusa. Think cancel culture is an achingly millennial movement? Try the Terror, which spread through Mary Wollstonecraft’s adopted Paris in the years after the Revolution when segments of the left, after a handsome and brave new dawn, began to ensure that thinking the wrong thoughts would not merely get you censored but torched out of (or often inside) your own home. Getting righteous and huffy in middle England at the insidious distribution of inflammatory ideas? Again, nothing on Britain’s aristos in the early 1800s, who closed the free press and outlawed atheism. Schama, without ever being too heavy- handed, drew all these and many more parallels directly back to the Romantic squad’s passionate drive to convert the old religions of veneration and obedience to the new ones of insurrection and agitation.', 'Seldom was this more in evidence in the modern age than France (again) in 1968, students and workers together on barricades. One of Schama’s strengths as a presenter – and good on the broadcaster for resisting the blandishments of a myriad younger and arguably sexier historians – is that he can actually say he was in the streets of Paris during that long fraught hopeful summer (working, I believe, on his first book), and thus has an earned right to tell us all about it.', 'Crucially, Schama never talks down, or attempts to sugar the pill by presenting a complex argument as anything other. Your brain has to keep up. This is a great series, sadly only three parts. Plus, we get intriguing art lessons along the way – and great readings by Christopher Eccleston, Harriet Walter and hip-hop artist Testament.', 'If good moment of the week was Louis Theroux video-chatting to twins, first encountered 16 years ago, who have grown into lovely understanding human beings, bad moment of the week was the same terribly young twins being encouraged by their mother, that very long time ago, to form, in essence, a Nazi pop group. Smiley-faced Hitler emojis on the T-shirts, abhorrently racist lyrics. Even in hindsight – Life on the Edge is essentially a back catalogue of greatest hits, interspersed with reflections from an older, bearded, wiser Louis Theroux – this was a grim and nasty watch.', 'One might argue that Theroux has, throughout his career, with his mix of charm and his inviting, pregnant, come-hither silences, cleverly mixed interviewees of the near-credible type with those of the (frankly) mentally ill type. Nevertheless, he has told wider truths, from the wilder fringes of humanity and the extremes of belief – often toxic, or merely of the fruit-loopy conspiracist mindset (JFK: it was suicide) – and thus expanded our conversations. The twins’ mother, April, he did not blame: she was “incapable of seeing anything through a non-racial lens”. Can any among us feel anything else, now, except pity?', 'Theroux’s fascination is and always has been the exploitation of the vulnerable, and the fact even the most absurd charlatan can inspire real results. But Theroux is inextricably drawn to charlatans, and long may that continue.', 'I have read and heard some mild criticism regarding Sue Perkins being given the big two-nighter documentary Along the US-Mexico Border, seeking some truths about the wall, the border and immigration. Why not a grownup journalist?', 'I’ll tell you exactly why. Perkins is by far the most apt person for the job. She overflows with both natural wit and empathy, and is often braver than she looks. Plus, one aspect of bravery is being unafraid of nuance, of grey areas, open to the concept that one might hold two ideas in one’s head at the same time.', 'There was little doubt where her loyalties lay: the impassioned plea for fairness towards the end of the second episode showed that Perkins is nothing less than a true romantic. But she was demonstrably capable of showing the same understanding (and warm humour, reciprocated in kind) towards a good-ole-boy Texan rancher overrun nightly by migrants, as she would show to the dirt-poor, and the fleeing, themselves. A news reporter might have let slip far more righteous Trump-contempt; Perkins was sparing with her snark, and thus the programme was greater for letting us make up our own minds. A truly enlightening couple of nights.', 'Not sure whether Leicester’s having a good year of it. It was at a nightclub there where one of the Chocolate Men – a troupe of 12 black strippers, who have, in co-founder Louis’s words, “to be good dancers and have a penis length of more than eight inches” – got carried away on his debut dance. In what must have been the most eggshell-fraught phrase uttered in voiceover this year, “Django allows a woman to briefly engage in oral sex with him”.', 'So many questions, which the makers of The Black Full Monty, Channel 4’s documentary about Britain’s first all-black male strip group, duly, if but occasionally, asked.', '“Some might say what you’re doing is perpetuating stereotypes?” “Are you selling sex, or are you selling race?” Louis and co-promoter Dante gamely tried to bat them back: “You can never satisfy everyone… anything you do as a black guy is going to be hard… it’s a stepping-stone, people are earning money, living good, what about that?” But I’m not sure we ever got an answer that would satisfy, say, the head of race and gender studies at Oxbridge Polyversity.', 'Perhaps, because there are so many questions about this, we should (as the makers tended to in the end) just see it a little bit of good dirty fun.

We are stratospheres above that now and TfL will be saddled paying for this, even in our uncertain future.”', 'Russell also accused the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, of trying to hide the full cost of the scheme.', '“Last year he told us the Silvertown road tunnel would cost £1bn, but now we finally see what TfL will actually pay and it’s heading for £2bn. This is outrageous.”', 'Transport for London said the existing cost of building the tunnel – around £1bn – had not increased. It said the additional costs covered in the £2bn figure included “ongoing operational costs … for 25 years as well as any maintenance and asset renewal required”.', 'There has been growing opposition to the project from local residents and green campaigners who say it would be environmentally destructive and undermine efforts to clean up the capital’s polluted air. They also argue it “fatally undermines” efforts to build a green recovery from the coronavirus – with dire consequences for some of London’s most vulnerable citizens.', 'Last week the shadow minister for climate change and local MP, Matthew Pennycook, added his voice, calling on Khan to abandon the scheme, saying “green transport must be the future of our city”.', 'If it goes ahead, the tunnel would be funded with a loan to be repaid by introducing tolls on the Blackwall and Silvertown tunnels.', 'The TfL accounts state the authority would repay £65m a year – index linked – between 2025 and 2050. At 1.6% [the current retail price index], that would lead to a total payment of about £2bn by 2050.', 'A Transport for London (TfL) spokesperson did not dispute the overall figure of £2bn but said the cost of building the Silvertown Tunnel – around £1bn – had not increased.', 'In a statement they added: “All payments towards the Silvertown tunnel will be funded from a road user charge, which will cover both the Blackwall and Silvertown Tunnel and will only begin once it is available for use, with payments linked to the performance of the contractor on key criteria such as availability.', '“These charges will not only repay the construction costs, but will also cover the ongoing operational costs for the tunnel for 25 years as well as any maintenance and asset renewal required.”', 'A spokesperson for the mayor said Khan “ has been clear that he doesn’t want to replace one health crisis with another, and he is determined that our city’s recovery from coronavirus will be clean, green and sustainable”.', 'The spokesperson said a new tunnel at Silvertown was crucial because the existing infrastructure was “antiquated and worn out”.', '“The tunnel will provide a public transport-focused river crossing with improved bus links across the Thames. The combination of introducing tolls on both the Blackwall tunnel and at Silvertown – and the extension of the ultra low emission zone from 2021 so that Silvertown will be within the area covered – will play a crucial role in tackling congestion and improving air quality.”', 'Steve Chambers, an independent transport consultant and academic at London South Bank University, said the £2bn price tag meant the scheme was an “expensive debt” for TfL to service.', '“The financial risks of the scheme are becoming clearer and there is no guarantee that the debt can be serviced from tolls alone.

Like millions of other little children all over the world with posters of Paddy Ashdown above their beds, you had a dream: to one day lead our boys in yellow. But unlike them, your dream came true.', 'Now, you’ll have noticed that people are very angry at the moment, about all kinds of different things: the coronavirus pandemic, Brexit, racism, climate breakdown, the economy, the Tories, the Labour party. And we want all of those people to vote for your friends and mine, the Lib Dems, at the next general election. So what we need is a statement that implies we’re like, good, but in the most general possible way. OK, hold on, now I think you might love this. What about: “I am listening”? It’s good, isn’t it? Hoof the ball right back into the public’s court. Great stuff. OK, here’s two free drink tokens – enjoy the party, champ.', 'I’m being a little unfair to Ed Davey here, and in any case, dunking on the Lib Dems is so easy it’s almost distasteful. His speech on winning the leadership contest last week was only the latest in a long line of politicians’ statements promising that their biggest priority was to listen to the electorate. William Hague made needing to listen the centrepiece of his 1998 party conference speech, and Tony Blair did the same at his party conference in 2000.', 'Listening has felt especially ubiquitous this year. Rory Stewart’s vampiric London mayoral campaign involved asking people to invite him across their thresholds for a chat and a sleepover, an idea that, in the era of social distancing, seems about as contemporary as a sprightly quadrille. Taking listening-as-home-invasion into the pandemic age, Keir Starmer has spent the summer doing Zoom-based listening tours of the country. And in the US a few weeks ago, Joe Biden assured young voters that he would “hear their voices”, too.', 'It’s not just politicians either. In the wake of George Floyd’s death, brands and institutions rushed to social media to confirm that they too were listening. Sweaty Betty is listening. The University of Hull is listening. PG Tips, with an upturned teacup pressed against your bedroom wall, is listening.', 'Why all this emphasis on listening? More often than not, it’s little more than an easy thing to say when you don’t want to alienate voters – or customers – by falling down hard on one side of an issue. Listening does form a central part of what MPs do locally in their constituencies through their regular surgeries, a term which makes the process sound about as appealing as getting your knee reset by Michael Fabricant.', 'Talking about listening to an entire population, however, is all too often an empty platitude or performance. And no wonder politicians don’t want to actually listen to public grievances when so much of what they would hear is unfiltered rage. Boris Johnson’s “People’s PMQs” stunt has seen him receive questions from the public such as “When will you resign for your mishandling of the pandemic?” and the ever-popular “How do you sleep at night?”', 'Political listening is always, in the end, a selective process. Listening to whom? Whomever’s opinion already aligns best with the party’s values? Both Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour and Nigel Farage’s Brexit party claimed to be about listening to people. And in any case, not all concerns are created equal. Tinfoil milliners concerned about whether China is beaming coronavirus into their homes via cellular data waves, or your local crank who wants to make it punishable by law not to thank the bus driver are, I would argue, less worthy of airtime than people concerned about the impacts of systemic racism.', 'A popular belief of the political centre in the UK is that the act of listening in and of itself can somehow bring wildly diverging opinion on contentious issues to an imagined point of agreement or compromise. Extinction Rebellion has attracted criticism for its emphasis on setting up a citizens’ assembly  to discuss what should be done to tackle the climate crisis. It’s a noble enough idea, but as they often emphasise, time is running out. We don’t need more conversation, we need widespread divestment from fossil fuels. When brands promise they are listening on Black Lives Matter, it implies that what is required is more testimony rather than more action. And Starmer’s inexhaustible appetite for holding inquiries is a slightly different but related urge – sure, we can take action on things, but only after we spend a great deal of time yakking about it.', 'In Leah Bassel’s book The Politics of Listening, she writes: “Politics means naming the social forces that deflect attention from particular voices, and is necessarily adversarial as well as active and creative.” It is never going to be enough just to listen; one has to take action against the forces that mean certain voices are unheard in the first place.

Will YOU comply?!” (“Yes, Jeremy,” I sigh.) “Do you know how the government is going to shrink your takeaway pizzas?!” (“No, Jeremy.”) “Should all hotels allow dogs?!” (“I don’t know, Jeremy, I’m just trying to write an article, how do I minimise you.”)', 'The actual show is basically an Old Man Yells At Cloud Olympics, where members of the public compete to see who can call in and complain about millennials the loudest. The Human Paperclip is always joined by two panelists: one a Daily Mail/Express columnist who squawks out stock phrases like “fishing rights” and “rule Britannia” like a xenophobic parrot, and the other a tired liberal who just wants to go back to 2015. Clippy presents one of the day’s stories to his panellists in as friendly a manner as he can (“It looks like you’re trying to start a culture war.

Each one has a plot that resonates with Channel 5’s core values (“stay indoors, trust no-one, everyone is trying to kill you”), and while they all feel like they could have been written by American rightwing shock-jock Bill O’Reilly after an all-night bender, The Killer Choice takes Best Screenplay for Totally Batshit Plot.', 'A war veteran EMT has to choose between saving a pregnant woman or a dying man during a convenience-store robbery. She chooses the pregnant woman, but 10 years later the wife of the man who died has become the boss of the EMT’s husband with the sole intention of hiring a hitman to kill the husband and her daughter in front of the EMT. This is just the first 20 minutes – I haven’t even got to the bit where the wife of the dead man feeds his ashes to a Venus flytrap while whispering: “It won’t be long now, John.” It is exhilaratingly bad, but I would happily watch it again and again.

We promised to keep speaking out about the climate emergency, despite the formidable and well-funded forces who would much rather the subject remained buried. We adopted new language to emphasise the existential nature of the situation. We pledged to deepen our environmental reporting.

We have published investigations, scientific analysis, reports on species extinction and air quality – and we have kept the voices of those affected by global heating at the heart of our reporting.', 'In the past year, we’ve reported from the Arctic and Antarctic, as well as other climate frontlines: the Amazon, the Sahara, the wildfires of Australia and the American west. We reported from the Cop25 summit of governments (travelling there by train). We have closely covered the movements trying to bring about change, such as Extinction Rebellion and the school climate strikes. We dug deep into the loss of wildlife, the problems of air pollution and microplastics, and exposed the most polluting companies on the planet.', 'We want our supporters to know: when you fund us, this is what you are paying for.', 'But of course this environmental year has been unique for another reason. A succession of related crises, not least the global Covid-19 pandemic, has brought a new perspective. These crises have starkly demonstrated how so many of our global problems – public health, migration, food security, land conflict, equality, gender and race – intersect with our environmental catastrophe.', 'For example, many researchers now see a correlation between species-jumping viruses such as Covid-19 and humanity’s deep, destructive incursion into the natural world. Links between high air pollution and increased coronavirus infection rates have also become apparent, thanks to persistent Guardian reporting.

It generates awareness of the problems – as well as the solutions. It galvanises protest and resistance, putting pressure on government and industry to make positive changes.

As Christiana Figueres, the UN’s climate chief when the Paris deal was sealed in 2015, told our environment editor, Damian Carrington: “Without the work of the Guardian the delivery of the Paris agreement would have been far harder or perhaps even impossible … At a time when the darkness of fake news and doubt in science is everywhere, the Guardian is a point of light.”', 'But words alone may not be enough.

Consequently, the rest of the summer of 68 remains something of a blur, but it’s not surprising that my memories are vague: the 1960s are over half a century ago now – a fact that, I suppose, makes them genuinely historical.', 'And yet, just before that same summer, the US was aflame with the most widespread riots in its history, following the assassination of Martin Luther King in April. Nine weeks later, in June, Robert Kennedy was also assassinated, and the autumn began with the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, in August, terminating the hopes of the Prague Spring with brutal efficiency.', 'Furthermore, 1968 had started with baleful auguries. In January, in Vietnam, the North Vietnamese army and the Vietcong launched the Tet offensive, almost overwhelming the might of the American and South Vietnam military. There were more than half a million US troops in Vietnam at the time. As spring ended, Parisian students and workers took to the capital’s streets, unleashing an eruption of civil strife that created a near revolution, effectively ending the era of Gaullism. And Germany was also convulsed with a social upheaval driven by students that shook society to its foundations, initiating the policy of Vergangenheitsbewältigung (“Coming to terms with the past”) that still dominates German political debate and culture today. The list of significant sociopolitical traumas that occurred in that year is a long one. It is one of those years, like 1789 or 1848 or 1914 or 1933, where, with a little hindsight operating, one can see a paradigm shift in the affairs of the world and its peoples. Maybe that will prove true of 2020, as well.', 'As I began researching the precise time and location of my new novel, Trio (I had plumped, almost on a whim, for 1968) the serendipitous wisdom of my choice became apparent. Suddenly I had a fascinating context for my characters and their secret lives – all involved in different ways, in the making of a zany, swinging 60s movie – that had a strangely global relevance. The comedy and the absurdity of the situation, plus the intensely private and personal lives of the characters, were ideally counterposed with the darker geopolitical state of the world.', 'The cataclysms happening abroad had their effect on British society but, compared with the rest of the world, we were caught up in that complacent, hedonistic, freewheeling era. Despite malign rumblings in the background – sectarian discrimination in Northern Ireland provoking unrest and confrontation; Harold Wilson’s Labour government’s singular inability to pacify or negotiate with the trade unions – the state of Britain in the second half of the 60s is usually starkly contrasted with what was going on in the rest of the world. Britain’s travails seemed small-scale and localised compared with the whirlwinds tearing through the US, France, Germany and Italy and elsewhere.', 'The counterculture in Britain was small and isolated – intellectual and well-to-do – there was nothing similar to the stridency and potency of the student movements elsewhere. However, the historical watershed that was the 1960s and its legacy – and the tipping-point that was 1968 – can still be seen, albeit transformed, today. Martin Luther King’s assassination shifted the civil rights movement into something altogether more radicalised and militant. In 1968, Eldridge Cleaver published the seminal text Soul On Ice, placing the Black Power movement in the foreground of African American political engagement. In Memphis, striking black workers marched silently in protest with large placards slung around their necks proclaiming “I am a man” in foot-high letters. It’s not a big jump to Black Lives Matter.', 'Later, the vicious pitched battles between demonstrators and police in Chicago at the Democratic National Convention effectively demolished the hopes of Hubert Humphrey being elected president and allowed Richard Nixon to cruise to victory on a “law and order” ticket. Sound familiar? The same effect could be witnessed this coming November.', 'Other parallels abound. The French riots of May 1968 found their echo in the confrontations in Paris by the gilets jaunes last year. The first demonstrations at the Miss America pageant in September by the Women’s Liberation Movement started a process that led to victory in many feminist battles, although the war is not won, yet. At the Mexico City Olympic Games in October, black American medal-winners raised their fists in Black Power salutes on the podium. Now they “take the knee”. Far-left protest groups began to emerge with more anarchic, utopian objectives. In the US, the Weather Underground briefly flourished. In Germany the leftwing student movement, the SDS, nurtured the seeds of the Red Army Faction. Urban terrorism was reborn – direct action, circumventing due legal process, became more popular. We see the same tendencies today in Extinction Rebellion, Pussy Riot, Femen and other radical human rights organisations.', 'Whatever they may have inculcated or initiated, the swinging 60s in Britain didn’t actually begin in 1960. The early 60s were remarkably like the 50s, but various crucial cultural signposts have been proposed as to when the party actually started. Was it in 1964, when the first Brook Clinic opened and unmarried women as young as 16 could be prescribed the contraceptive pill? Was it in July that year when the Rolling Stones had their first No 1 hit with “It’s All Over Now”? Or was it the day that the model Jean Shrimpton wore a dress with the hem cut five inches above the knee to the Melbourne Races in 1965 and sparked world-wide astonishment and condemnation – and the miniskirt was born?', 'Dominic Sandbrook, in his remarkable and compendious history of the era, White Heat, plausibly advances the key moment as something less ephemeral, occurring in January 1965 when Winston Churchill – who was born in 1874 – died. With Churchill’s death went the last symbol of British Victorian imperial hegemony, and all the national myths constructed around him, and by him, suddenly lost their objective correlative. We were just another mid-sized country slowly sliding down the road to relative powerlessness and moderate influence. It was time for a change and the change duly occurred, but not in the way the rest of the word experienced it. Sandbrook comments that, “Bearing in mind [Britain’s] self-conscious traditions of conservatism and pragmatism, the relatively comfortable conditions in the universities, the rather gloomy stability of its political life and the long continuity of its institutions, it is hardly surprising that Britain did not witness vast protests to compare with Paris in May 1968.”', 'It wasn’t all depressing however, there was fun to be had. Elvis Presley rebooted his career with massive weight loss and a Comeback Special; Stanley Kubrick’s film 2001: A Space Odyssey was released; Hair opened on Broadway; the Beatles didn’t break up, their White Album indicating that the show was still on the road, sort of; and the Apollo 8 astronauts successfully orbited the moon in the days leading up to Christmas.', 'So 1968 ended on something of an upbeat note – but the consensus was that many parts of the world had been through a particularly torrid, bleak and conflict-ridden period. In the editorial of its end-of-year issue, Time magazine summed up the preceding 12 months. “Seldom has the nation been confronted with such a congeries of doubts and discontents. While US prestige declined abroad, the nation’s self-confidence sank to a nadir at which it became a familiar litany that American society was afflicted with some profound malaise of spirit and will.” For the US, read the world.

Greenhouse gas emissions, heatwaves, wildfires, melting polar ice, floods, droughts, the annihilation of wildlife, air pollution … the problems grow more severe every year.', 'Of course, 2020 has been dominated by the coronavirus pandemic, but even here the correlation with environmental destruction is clear.', 'The “tip of the iceberg” – that was the warning early in the year, when we reported that many more viruses were present in wildlife and just waiting to be released by the human destruction of nature. The UN’s environment chief said “nature is sending us a message” that our abuse of the planet had consequences.', 'As critical as it is to tackle the damage caused by Covid-19, the root cause – the invasion of wild places and the exploitation of wild animals – is not being addressed, experts warned in the Guardian, despite the relatively tiny amount it would cost. Without action, even worse pandemics would happen, top scientists warned.', 'The cascade of pandemic impacts is also hitting food supplies in vulnerable places, with the Guardian highlighting fears of the worst food crisis in 50 years and a “famine of biblical proportions”. We also revealed how meat processing plants had become hotspots of Covid-19 infections among workers: “Everyone’s on top of you, sneezing and coughing,” one person told us.', 'While a temporary reduction in air pollution was a rare benefit of the pandemic, long-term exposure to dirty air appears to drive up Covid infections and deaths. The Guardian revealed the latest research, including a striking study providing compelling evidence of a link, as well as the discovery of the virus on pollution particle samples. Poor quality air might also help explain the disproportionate impact of Covid on minority ethnic communities, we revealed.', 'The coronavirus crisis is also an opportunity, however, with trillions of dollars being deployed to fund the recovery. In-depth series in both the UK and Australia set out how this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to put the world on track to tackle the climate crisis, transforming energy, transport, food and even aviation.', 'Of course, fossil fuel vested interests remain, and the Guardian exposed their lobbying for cash in the US, Australia and around the world. We also took a road trip around the UK to seek the views of ordinary people on the Covid recovery. The conclusion: few want a return to “normal”.', 'That normal would mean the relentless rise of global heating, with the brief cut in emissions during lockdown no more than a blip. Nowhere is that heating more obvious than in the oceans. In January, the Guardian’s print edition led its front page with the news of a record high ocean temperature in 2019, showing the “irrefutable and accelerating” heating of the planet.', 'The danger signs kept coming, and we kept reporting them, from the temperature in the Antarctic rising above 20C for the first time on record, to deforestation in the Amazon hitting its highest level in a decade.', 'One of the principal duties of the Guardian is to hold power to account. Our landmark series, The Polluters, revealed the 20 fossil fuel companies whose exploitation of oil, gas and coal reserves had caused more than one-third of all carbon emissions in the modern era, as well as Google’s funding of climate change deniers and the power of the car lobby.', 'In the US, the 100 days countdown series to the US withdrawal from the 2015 Paris agreement showed how the global climate fight could be lost if Donald Trump is re-elected and how worsening heatwaves are exacerbating systemic racial inequalities.', 'In Australia, the Guardian ran an agenda-setting interactive series, The Frontline, laying bare the climate emergency in the country. The starkest illustration were the devastating bushfires that raged through the summer months and were documented in The Summer of Dread and After the Bushfires projects.

We have championed the protesters, being at the UN in New York for Greta Thunberg’s emotional condemnation of world leaders, and exploring in depth the rise of Extinction Rebellion and how it can reinvent itself for a post-pandemic world. We also revealed that a quarter of all tweets about the climate crisis came from bots that amplified denialist messages.', 'Like the climate emergency, the annihilation of wildlife that threatens the air, water and food on which we depend has not gone away, and neither has the Guardian’s coverage of the crisis. In our Age of Extinction series we examined the deadly truth behind almond milk – “it’s like sending bees to war” – and, like all Guardian exclusives, this was followed up widely by other media.', 'We also revealed the $1m-a-minute farming subsidies that are ravaging the natural world and the mysterious mass die-off of hundreds of elephants in Botswana, and dug into the UK’s high-speed rail project’s impact on biodiversity and climate change.', 'The largest environmental cause of human disease and death in the world today is pollution, responsible for many millions of premature deaths. We have kept a sharp focus on this, revealing, for example, research linking air pollution to brain cancer for the first time.', 'Pollution takes many forms and we have reported in depth on the “cancer town” in the US where the risk of the disease is 50 times above the national average, and revealed that microplastic pollution is raining down on city dwellers, with as yet unknown effects on lung health.', 'Rivers have long suffered from pollution but we revealed the startling fact that water companies discharged raw sewage into English rivers more than 200,000 times in 2019. The only thing worse than dirty water is no water, and we exposed the scandal of millions of US citizens being unable to afford water bills.', 'While hard-hitting news is at the Guardian’s core, some stories need space to tell, such as our journey to Antarctica where we encountered the surprising sound of icebergs melting, and our long read on the career of the world’s most revered naturalist, Sir David Attenborough. Another extraordinary tale was that of Takaya, the lone sea wolf whose spirit captured worldwide attention.', 'We also know that finding solutions is vital in tackling the environmental challenges facing the world, which is why we reported from Darfur on how a water project was helping to end the “first climate change war” and how scientists created a mutant bacterial enzyme that broke down plastic bottles for recycling in hours.', 'In the UK, the good news included the benefits of beavers, which now have a permanent home in Devon as well as Scotland, and plans to rewild a large patch of East Anglia and to bring back wild bison for the first time in 6,000 years.', 'The Guardian’s commitment to environmental reporting has real world impacts, but these are rarely easy to measure. So it is useful to hear from those at the top.', 'Christiana Figueres, the UN’s climate chief when the Paris deal was sealed in 2015, said: “Without the work of the Guardian the delivery of the Paris agreement would have been far harder or perhaps even impossible.

At a time when the darkness of fake news and doubt in science is everywhere, the Guardian is a point of light.”', 'Bill McKibben, the leading climate writer and campaigner, said: “There is nothing in the English-language press that comes close to matching the scope and the commitment of the Guardian’s coverage of climate change.

https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/01/entitled-by-kate-manne-review-how-male-privilege-hurts-women,"['The ‘Philosopher of #MeToo’ examines the dynamics of male/female relationships in a fresh, illuminating way', 'This book doesn’t let up. What starts as a series of anecdotes about male privilege and how it motivates men to act in violent ways develops into a narrative about the corrosive effects of entitlement. Kate Manne, dubbed “the philosopher of #MeToo”, focuses particularly on the entitlement of men to goods provided by women. Misogyny is how women are policed and made to observe limitations, “a bit like the shock collar worn by a dog to keep them behind one of those invisible fences that proliferate in suburbia”.', 'Men demand from women that they give, among other things, consent, admiration, sex, bodily control and domestic labour. Each chapter describes how an entitlement works, with supporting examples. In the chapter “Involuntary – On the Entitlement to Admiration”, Manne cites incidents of self-described “incels” murdering women who have spurned them, or who they imagine have done so. What should feel like familiar territory, the retributive violence wreaked on women for rejecting men, is covered in an entirely new and illuminating way that frames such violence as a product of masculine hierarchy. Manne draws connections and expands her analysis beyond male/female power dynamics, making a strong case that these power dynamics are not about sex or women per se, but intersect frequently with racism.', 'With perspicacity and clear, jargon-free language, Manne keeps elevating the discussion to show how male privilege isn’t just about securing and hoarding spoils from women, but an entire moral framework. She rejects the notion that on one level men see women as inhuman, simply robotic or two-dimensional providers. Women do have volition and the capacity to choose for themselves, but it is when those choices do not align with what men want that things become difficult.', 'Manne explains how women of colour, trans women and other women made vulnerable by class or sexual orientation are subjected to the compounded effects of male entitlement. In the chapter “Incompetent – On the Entitlement to Medical Care”, a series of mishaps that result from medical practitioners in the US not taking women seriously makes for stomach-churning reading. Stories of black women losing fallopian tubes and babies because their pain was dismissed show our expectation of women as care providers, not care receivers. At every point, whether it was in the blood curdling recognition of the black woman being sent home with an aspirin as a foetus tore through her insides, or the comical identification with the writer being lectured to by a man about her own book, I felt Manne explaining to me, gently but relentlessly, that the state of being a woman is simply to provide and provide.', 'Perhaps the most revealing section deals with how women are shaped by this constant extension of themselves. The coronavirus lockdown has exposed the vast difference between the work men do at home and the amount of work they think they do. And women, so accustomed to defining themselves in terms of how well they care and provide for others, struggle to demand help.', 'But we cannot despair. The rage and sadness of the book is lifted by Manne’s final chapter in which she addresses her unborn daughter, wishing for her all the things she should feel entitled to – bodily autonomy, to speak her mind, to make mistakes. “It will be a ‘long interminable fight’,” Manne says of what lies ahead of her daughter, “but for her, I can say: I am in it.” For Manne’s daughter and many others, this book will make that fight a little bit easier.', 'Entitled is published by Allen Lane (£20).

I know many people around the world have been looking forward to this race and I am sorry to disappoint my fans, the organisers and my fellow competitors.”', 'Hugh Brasher, the event director of the race, tried to put a brave face on the news. “We know how disappointed Kenenisa is and we wish him a speedy recovery,” he said. “But this was never likely to be just a two-man race as we had four of the top-10 fastest marathon runners – and six men in the field who have broken 2:05, including Mosinet Geremew and Mule Wasihun, second and third last year, and the 2018 runner-up, Shura Kitata.”', 'The women’s race, which kicks off proceedings off at 7.15am on Sunday, should still live up to its billing as the world record holder, Brigid Kosgei, faces the world champion, Ruth Chepngetich, and the 2018 winner, Vivian Cheruiyot.

On the left are bills: a single sheet. On the right is a sheaf of letters from friends and lovers. “If the pile of letters is growing faster than the pile of bills, you’re on the right track,” says Rosell. “If it’s the other way round, you’re on the wrong track. It’s not that hard, the revolution I’m proposing.”', 'We are sitting on a wooden bench at a wooden table beneath a ceiling made of braided ribbons of wood, in Rosell’s house in the Cévennes, a mountain range in the south of France. Rosell looks like someone who has been fighting a revolution for half a century: untamed white hair, bare chest and feet, grubby black tracksuit bottoms. A weatherbeaten Robinson Crusoe, still hale and eager to take on cannibals – or capitalists – at 73.', 'He has lived here, far from any road or other habitation, since the 1970s, not long after spinning out, breathless and bloodied, from the 1968 student uprisings in Paris. Many of his rebel comrades urged a return to a simpler life, but few enacted it. He found a remote plot in the least densely populated region of France and built a bioclimatic home on it; that is, a house with low energy requirements and a light environmental footprint.', 'He hoarded rainwater, composted, recycled his waste water and heated his house with firewood and solar panels. Not for him salaried work, which he refers to as “five days of prostitution followed by two days of resuscitation”. He preferred to take what he needed – and no more – from nature. On the day I visit, he shows me a shallow pool filled with electric-green water, in which he grows the protein-rich algae spirulina: delicious, he says, with olive oil and garlic. It complements a diet rich in wild plants: 70 species altogether, which he gathers from the forest.', 'Rosell currently lives alone. He does not believe in marriage and never had kids, he says, but people passed through. Some came out of curiosity, and left again; others moved in. He taught those who were interested how to live as self-sufficiently as possible. Young people bold enough to venture to his University of Applied Collective Ecology built walls out of crushed sunflowers and cow dung, motors that ran on seaweed, and reed beds that transformed sewage into drinking water. It was emphatically experimental, and it did not always work. But his approach, dismissed as eccentric by his contemporaries, appeared increasingly sensible to generations fearful that humanity had damaged the planet beyond repair, then urgent to the growing number of his compatriots who feel that their society is on the verge of collapse.', 'The belief that we are heading for some kind of all-consuming crisis is not exclusively French, of course. Serious scientists all over the world are discussing it. Wealthy Americans were buying spots in Armageddon-proof bunkers long before Covid-19, and militant environmental and social protest movements have been on the rise everywhere. Within Europe, however, a survey published last November by the left-leaning French thinktank the Jean Jaurès Foundation found that only Italy beat France for pessimism about the future. Seventy-one per cent of Italians and 65% of French people agreed with the statement that “civilisation as we know it will collapse in the years to come”; 56% of Brits shared that apocalyptic vision – slightly ahead of Americans, at 52% – while Germans came in last with a sanguine 39%.', 'In 2015, two Frenchmen, Pablo Servigne and Raphaël Stevens, who describe themselves as independent researchers, co-wrote an essay entitled How Everything Can Collapse, in which they introduced the term “collapsology”. In a long interview Servigne gave to Philosophie magazine this year, he explained that, at first, their neologism was tongue-in-cheek. The concept must have struck a chord, though, because within a couple of years he found himself at the head of a movement, and this summer the word collapsologie entered the popular French dictionary Le Petit Robert. “We created a monster,” Servigne told Philosophie.', 'For the authors of the Jean Jaurès study, the political scientist Jérôme Fourquet and the pollster Jean-Philippe Dubrulle, collapsology is driven at least in part by economic factors. The least apocalyptically minded country they polled, Germany, also has (or had, pre-Covid-19) the strongest economy, while the countries where the movement has the largest following – Italy and France – are those where economic performance has been poorest of late, and social and political tensions run high.', 'They deliberately left their statement vague as to the causes of the coming collapse, because people in different countries think differently about these. In Britain and Germany, the emphasis is on the climate crisis, as seen in the emergence of Extinction Rebellion in the UK. But in France, where they overlap to some extent with the gilets jaunes movement, collapsologists also consider society to be sick. The idea is that rampant consumerism, ever-accelerating technological advances and the dominance of neoliberalism are leading French people to perdition.', 'It is probably for this reason, say Fourquet and Dubrulle, that France stands apart from the other countries they surveyed in one important way: whereas in general the movement is strongest in the under-35 age group, “in our country, all generations, the 65-and-overs included, share the same sombre diagnosis”.', 'The movement also cuts across political boundaries, embracing everyone from the far right to the far left. One of the most outspoken collapsologists is Yves Cochet, a politician with Europe Ecology – France’s green party – and a former environment minister in Lionel Jospin’s leftwing government of the early 00s. He has retreated to a farmhouse in Britanny and reputedly has not seen the inside of a plane since 2009. But there are also French “survivalists” who – at least until about a decade ago – shared the drawbridge mentality of the Americans stocking up on peanut butter and ammo.', 'After the financial crisis of 2008, says Bertrand Vidal, a sociologist at the University of Montpellier who studies these groups, the predominantly rightwing, libertarian survivalists shifted closer to Servigne and Stevens’s softer, back-to-nature school of how-to-avert-the-worst, with its emphasis on sustainability. Differences between them remain, but one thing they share is a neo-Malthusian conviction that there are too many people on Earth. Even those who overtly criticise capitalism believe in a post-apocalyptic winnowing of the human species, in which nature will determine who lives and who dies. “They use the analogy of the grasshopper and the ant,” Vidal says, referring to the fable in which the ant survives the winter because it prepared for cold weather, while the improvident grasshopper expires.', 'The uncertainty created by ongoing financial instability, climate change and now Covid-19 has shrunk the ideological distance between the two camps still further, while at the same time swelling their followings. “People hesitate to call themselves collapsologists or survivalists,” says Vidal. “Nevertheless, I’ve noticed that it has become a subject of general preoccupation. It’s no longer restricted to a minority of fanatics.”', 'These days it is mainly a middle-class phenomenon, in part because you have to have the means to be able to contemplate a radical life change. You probably also grew up with certain expectations that you perceive to have been frustrated by the deteriorating state of the world. “These are people who don’t see a future and who, in searching for a sense to their social disqualification, find it in this idea of the end of the world,” says Vidal. It is also markedly urban – as it was in the 70s – being fuelled by a romanticised image of what it means to live self-sufficiently in a low-tech, rural setting. For that reason, most collapsologists are content to discuss their anxieties, without acting on them.', 'Servigne acted. Born in Versailles in 1978, he studied agronomy in Belgium before completing a PhD in sociobiology. The subject of his thesis was cooperation in ants. It was the early 00s, and the scientific consensus was moving away from the idea that cooperative behaviour is genetically determined – you only help your kin – to one that said the environment matters too: social animals band together in harsh conditions, even if they are not related, because their survival depends on it. This chimed with arguments he had heard in anarchist circles, and after his second son was born, he and his family left their cramped apartment in Brussels – and the academic life – to move closer to nature and likeminded people.', 'They ended up in the Drôme, a mountainous region in south-east France near Grenoble, living close to a forest where the children regularly glimpse birds of prey, wild boar, even wolves. Ironically, Servigne himself does not have time to garden – he is too busy leading a movement – but growing food is central to the family’s and community’s lifestyle. And though he and Stevens have yet to publish their vision of how best to live in the shadow of collapse – it is a work-in-progress – central to it is the concept of permaculture: living off the land, durably. Permaculture embraces organic and traditional forms of farming, but it can also extend to other domains of life: recycling, barter, homeschooling.', 'Unlike Cochet, who claims that things will fall apart in 2030 – in a series of mainly climatic catastrophes that will eliminate half the world’s population – Servigne does not predict when the collapse will happen. Indeed, he thinks we may already have entered the endgame. (Among scientists, there is a parallel debate over whether the people of lost civilisations, such as the Minoans or the Hittites, realised their societies were collapsing.)', 'Nor does he claim to have all the answers, though he believes that salvation lies in slow, local, group-based solutions. “Small is beautiful,” he says. In the eyes of many French people he has taken on the status of a guru, not unlike Greta Thunberg internationally (she herself has been compared to an earlier French guru, Joan of Arc). And although he insists that his thinking is grounded in science, he does not shy away from accusations that his crusade has a religious dimension. For him, it is impossible to think about humanity’s place on the planet without engaging in spiritual or philosophical reflection. Science, after all, has provided a diagnosis but no workable solutions to date.', 'Collapsology has plenty of detractors. The philosopher Jean-Pierre Dupuy, of the École Polytechnique in Paris and Stanford University in California, has two major criticisms. The first is that, despite vaunting their scientific credentials, collapsologists have misunderstood the fundamental nature of complex systems, whether they be ecological, financial, social or climatic. Servigne, for example, contends that the more globalised and connected human societies become, the more vulnerable they are to disruption. This is plainly wrong, says Dupuy. “It is in their complexity that both the resilience and the vulnerability of systems lie, meaning that collapse is far from a given, just because the system becomes more complex.”', 'Second, by predicting collapse on a certain date – as Cochet does – collapsologists shoot themselves in the proverbial foot. They are effectively saying that nothing we do will make any difference, but if that is true, we might as well sit back and wait for the end. They risk either engendering fatalistic resignation or, if people do act, being proved wrong. If their goal is to avert the calamity, they should prefer the second option. “The curse of the prophet of doom is to be condemned to be a false prophet,” says Dupuy.', 'He acknowledges that he is taking risks of his own, in criticising the collapsologists, because the threats to humanity are real, and they include the indifference of the vast majority of us. It is possible, though far from certain, that Covid-19 will wake us up; that people will see it as a taste of what is to come. Collapsologists read the pandemic differently. Bizarre as it may seem, says Vidal, many greeted it enthusiastically – as vindication. “For them, the catastrophe represents a sort of tabula rasa, a sweeping away of the errors of the past, and a step closer to the day when society will reboot itself.”', 'Yogan Bredel-Samson, a carpenter and builder who is raising a family in a bioclimatic cabin in the woods of the Dordogne, as part of a community of nature-loving artisans and artists, says: “When the coronavirus came, we were very happy to have our old ploughs and wooden tools, our gardens and horses.” He credits Rosell for inspiring his life change – he was a student at the latter’s alternative university 20 years ago – but says that what he took from that experience was how to live sustainably. Rosell’s politics, which he considered extreme, left him cold. “I’m against supermarkets,” he says, “not money.”', 'Meanwhile, Rosell continues his life’s experiment. Before I leave, he shows me a sweet chestnut sapling he has grafted on to an oak, in the hope that it will one day bear fruit. He does not fear Covid-19, having confidence in his immune system, because he has nourished it properly all these years. Does he see the pandemic as a warning?

Should that change be made permanent?', 'Hollingbury golf course is a big splodge of green bleeding into Brighton’s grey urban sprawl. For more than a century, its 18 holes have risen above the seaside city towards the ruins of an iron age hillfort, which is now enclosed by holes nine, 12, 13, and 14. From Hollingbury’s highest point, it is possible to look west on a clear day and see the hills of the Isle of Wight.', 'As housing has spread around the course, which is owned by the council, so has tension between golfers and walkers, who are permitted to cut across it on a network of footpaths and old drovers’ tracks. Relations seem calm on the autumn day I visit, but I gather “Fore!” is not the only four-letter exclamation to have bounced along the manicured fairways.', 'In late March, the awkward relationship flipped on its head when a lockdown ban on golf coincided with a yearning for green space among Britain’s confined households. A national campaign, supported by the Brighton MP Caroline Lucas, called for golf courses to be opened to the public to relieve crowded parks.', 'At Hollingbury, which has no fences and is part of the South Downs national park, residents responded like calves put out to pasture. They cartwheeled on the fairways and picnicked on the greens. “It was like being in the mountains up here, with that open-space feeling that makes you feel immediately better,” says Michaela Spryanova, an office administrator who lives just beyond the course’s western edge.', 'Rachel Henson, an artist and translator, came here every day, basking in the spring sunshine and sweeping views over Brighton and the Channel. She taught her daughter to ride a bike on the sloping fairway of hole 10. “We learned all the common birdsong together,” she says.', 'But then, in June, golf was permitted once more – and golfers reclaimed the course. “We knew it was coming, but it was a terrible shock,” Henson says as we walk with Spryanova from their children’s school after the morning drop-off. We stroll up towards the hillfort on one of the old paths to which non-golfers are again confined. “It depressed me so much I couldn’t come up here for a while,” Henson adds.', 'The struggle for space at Hollingbury – and a second council-owned golf course two miles to the west at Waterhall – reflects a wider debate about conservation, ecology and democratic access to green space. As a pandemic triggers a revolt on many of Britain’s fairways, it poses a vexed question: is it time we opened up all golf courses to the public for good?', 'One of the joys and challenges of golf is that it requires a lot of nice green space. How much space is disputed. A common claim that Britain’s golf courses occupy more land than housing is based on dodgy estimates, but it is a lot of land.', 'The American writer Malcolm Gladwell once considered the scale of gated golf courses in Los Angeles, a city of few parks. He calculated that if you gave each player on a basketball court the space a golfer commands, the court would cover 12 hectares (30 acres); the hoops would be more than 400 metres apart. “They’d have to play on motorcycles,” Gladwell wrote.', 'Yet this calculation depends on a course being busy. Not all courses are busy. Steve Garrioch, who has been the captain at Hollingbury since 2009, tells me he was one of significantly more than 500 members when he joined 20 years ago. There are now 122 members and about twice as many season-ticket holders.', 'Garrioch, a leather merchant, blames an oversupply: Hollingbury is one of six courses within five miles of Brighton Palace pier in a city of about 300,000 people. But its decline is not unusual. According to a participation report by KPMG late last year, membership of golf courses in Great Britain dropped to a low of slightly more than 850,000, down almost 20,000 in a year. In Scotland, membership has dropped by 14% since 2014. Yet the number of courses – more than 2,000 – is relatively stable.', 'Hollingbury, which opened in 1908, is not exclusive. “It’s for working-class people,” Garrioch says. “We’ve got taxi drivers, builders … there’s nothing elite about it.” Yet perceptions fuelled the debate about the role of courses in lockdown. “I think a certain US president has done golf no favours,” says Guy Shrubsole, a campaigner and the author of Who Owns England?. For Shrubsole, Donald Trump – and the eponymous courses on which he has played out a large part of his presidency – exemplifies the image of golf as a gated, gilded pursuit.', 'In early April, when many councils threatened to shut the gates of crowded parks, Shrubsole launched a petition at change.org calling for golf courses to be opened. More than 7,500 people signed it. Lockdown was highlighting space inequality; studies show that people in poorer postcodes not only have smaller gardens, or none at all, but also less access to smaller parks.', 'Pushing open the gates of golf courses began to feel like a moral imperative. “There’s a sense that golf is played by a small number of people and that they are potentially quite wealthy, retired, white men who don’t necessarily represent society,” Shrubsole says.', 'It is not known how many courses opened to the public. It was a fraught process for many that did. “We had nudity on the greens and kids riding bikes straight over the bunkers,” Garrioch says. Elsewhere, there were reports of quad biking, horse riding and rampant picnicking. One couple were spotted playing a rather different sport in a bunker at Glenbervie golf club near Falkirk in central Scotland. “This isn’t Butlin’s,” an anonymous member of the club told the Daily Record. “It’s frustrating that members aren’t even allowed to get their daily exercise by playing a round on their own in the fresh air, yet you’ve got locals having sex in the bunkers. Where’s the social distancing in that?”', 'But for the responsible majority, including Henson, Spryanova and their families, the overnight arrival of new parks was a revelation. “I wanted to shift debate and say there was something deeper going on here – this was about our exclusion from public space and our inability to provide enough of it,” Shrubsole says.', 'That debate was big in Brighton before the pandemic. Ten-year management contracts at Hollingbury and Waterhall were due to expire on 31 March. “It came up at pretty much my first committee meeting last year,” says Marianna Ebel, a German-born IT engineer who was elected as a Green party councillor for Goldsmid ward in May 2019.', 'Brexit inspired Ebel, 35, to enter local politics. She is now the joint chair of the council’s tourism, equalities, communities and culture committee, so council-owned golf courses are her responsibility. For a while, it was assumed a new operator would simply take over the leases. “But I remember looking at the membership numbers,” Ebel says. “I thought: ‘Instead of continuing, how about rewilding the courses?’”', 'In October, the council appointed an estate agent to market the courses, offering 25-year management leases. But they also invited bids for other uses, including projects to restore the wildlife-rich chalk grassland on which the courses were laid.', '“We simply cannot miss this exciting opportunity to create a health & wellbeing sanctuary and a wildlife haven for all,” read a petition launched in late December by the Brighton branch of Extinction Rebellion (XR), the environmental campaign group. Counter-petitions called for golf to be saved. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrats in the city pushed for the space to be used for affordable housing.', 'More than 5,000 people signed the rewilding petition, including Chris Packham, the presenter and campaigner. In January, XR Brighton held a protest outside a committee meeting. They marched on Hollingbury. “We’re not anti-golf,” insists Ben Benatt, an ecology surveyor and XR member. “It’s about a sustainable solution that addresses the climate and biodiversity emergency.”', 'In January, the council awarded a new contract for Hollingbury, securing its future as a golf course. It was a blow to campaigners and the families who had roamed the course. But the council also announced that Waterhall, where membership was in steeper decline, would shut down for a rare experiment: the rewilding of a golf course.', '“They call chalk grassland rainforests in miniature,” says Kim Greaves, as we crouch low on the first green at Waterhall. The 37-year-old played here briefly as a teenager. These days, he works with adults with learning disabilities and teaches Brazilian jujitsu, a martial art that relies on skilful leverage. He is also an amateur naturalist and part of the campaign to restore Waterhall.', 'Golfers abandoned the course when lockdown stopped play just seven days before the old lease expired. It had stood here since 1923. Six months later, the greens are cracking up. Daisies and ragwort are growing and the old holes and bunkers are filling with soil and debris.', 'The clubhouse, which sits just above the first green, has sweeping downland views. There is one proposal to move the building towards a rugby club, where dog walkers now park to enjoy the old course, and turn it into an education centre. For now, it is a symbol of a lost era. Abandoned trophies left in the window of the Spike Bar collect dust next to a golf glove, on which a large bumblebee has expired.', 'The very thin layer of soil that covers chalk in valleys across the south-east of England – the result of centuries of grazing – lets rain drain straight through it. Nutrients are scant, so dominant grasses, and the shrubs and trees that would succeed them, tend not to do well. Instead, an array of resilient wildflowers cling to the earth, supporting rare species of butterfly and birds.', 'Diversity on the old greens is still low; it will take years for the effects of mowing and pesticides to be flushed out. But Greaves wants to show me what is happening on the fringes of the fairways. Wildflowers with evocative names – betony, harebell, devil’s-bit scabious, lady’s bedstraw – are creeping in from the rough.', '“I even saw a round-headed rampion in the middle of the fairway,” Greaves says of a survey he did in the summer. “It might have been there without flowering for decades.” The delicate blue flower, also known as the Pride of Sussex, is a magnet for the chalkhill blue butterfly.', 'Rewilding here will require management. Without any intervention, ecological succession will do its thing, even on thin soil. Last month, the council took responsibility for the project after a leaseholder pulled out. Greaves is anxious to start controlling the hawthorn that is already dominating areas between fairways. In other ecosystems, big fauna would do this kind of work. “Perhaps we’ll introduce elephants here eventually,” Greaves says with a smile.', 'Golf still offers pleasure and exercise to hundreds of thousands of people. Many clubs enjoyed a growth in visitor numbers when they reopened in June; golf is nothing if not a socially distanced sport. Even XR Brighton says a sensitively managed links is far from the worst way to preserve green space, “especially if it brings a revenue stream that can help manage it in the right way”, Benatt says.', 'Housing can be an obvious – and lucrative – alternative, especially when privately owned courses can rescue their finances with a sale to developers. Reading golf club, another old, struggling course, will next year merge with Caversham Heath, a club two miles to the west. A controversial housing development will take its place.', 'But Waterhall’s fate adds weight to campaigns for old courses to remain green yet public, making permanent the freedom that excluded communities briefly enjoyed this year. Four years ago, Lewisham council closed a municipal 18-hole golf course that had occupied an old Georgian estate in Beckenham, south-east London. It is now a public park with a restored lake for swimming and boating. “It shows what local campaigns can do,” Shrubsole says.', 'It will take time for balance to be restored at Hollingbury. Today, walkers and joggers outnumber golfers by far. “It’s just getting ridiculous,” says Brian Coomber, a club member who is looking for his ball in the rough next to the 10th fairway. He says people have been using the footpaths way more since golf resumed, interrupting play and messing up the fairways. “Don’t get me wrong, I’ve got a dog myself, but at the end of the day this isn’t common land,” he says. His friend, Dave Slocombe, nods in agreement. Days later, the men leave Hollingbury to join East Brighton golf club, which is only three miles away.', 'Henson and Spryanova still walk on Hollingbury, where Spryanova says a few comments from golfers have made her children feel uncomfortable on their walk to school. Lockdown inspired Henson’s art. She made videos of the course, in which images of cartwheeling children fade into more recent footage of golf. Birds sing in the background. As we stand at the hillfort, taking in the sweep of Brighton, she can still picture those weeks. “At sunset, everyone would have been sitting here looking west, each little group taking a mound,” she says. “It looked a bit like a very spaced out village green.”', 'This article was amended on 27 October 2020 because an earlier version mistakenly said that “Liberal Democrat councillors pushed for the space to be used for affordable housing”.

The police had come to riot. Wielding batons, they stormed forward yelling, “Kill Davis!” he recalls. He was cracked on the head, knocked to the ground and felt lucky to escape with his life.', 'It could be a scene from this year’s summer of civil unrest in America. In fact it was a demonstration outside the 1968 Democratic national convention in Chicago that descended into a violent clash with police and the national guard.', 'The story of Davis and other organisers of the protest is told in The Trial Of The Chicago 7, a film written and directed by Aaron Sorkin that premieres on Netflix on 16 October. Its star-studded cast includes Sacha Baron Cohen, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Michael Keaton, Frank Langella, Eddie Redmayne and Mark Rylance.', 'In an interview with the Guardian, Davis, 80, says he was not consulted during production of the film and expresses serious reservations about how he and fellow activists are portrayed. But he also welcomes the timeliness of its release.', '“Coming out at this time is just really perfection,” he says by phone from his home near Boulder, Colorado. “There are some things that I wouldn’t agree with how Sorkin has characterised certain figures in the trial, myself included. But the impact of the movie is there and I certainly endorse and support it.”', 'The tumult of 2020 – a global pandemic, economic crisis, an uprising over racial injustice – has frequently been compared to 1968, when the Vietnam war was raging, Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were assassinated and major cities were engulfed by violence.', 'From a farm community in Michigan, Davis’s political awakening came in the early 60s. He helped created Students for a Democratic Society, effectively the voice for students in the north. Davis was an activist and community organiser and joined the antiwar movement in around 1965.', 'By the summer of 1968, Americans were dying at a rate of more than 1,000 per month in the worst year of the Vietnam war. Davis became the national coordinator of a coalition of 150 organisations dedicated to nonviolence that went to Chicago.', '“Our initial plan was to bring 500,000 people to Chicago and it was simply because the mayor refused to grant permits that the numbers reduced, but the result was a police riot. That’s how a presidential commission defined what happened. But it was watched on television by more people than watched the moment the first man landed on the moon. It was incredible.”', 'Eventually the city did grant a permit for a demonstration in Chicago’s Grant Park that was so benign it included parents with babies. Davis remembers that a young person lowered a flag to half-staff, later explaining it as a symbol of international distress.', '“The police saw the flag coming down and basically came in and beat people as they arrested this person. We had a very highly organised team of close to 4,000 marshals so I was able to put up a human chain where arms were linked.', '“We faced out towards the police to just bring the whole situation under complete control in a matter of minutes. Then I announced to the police that we have a permit and you can see we are able to secure this properly, so if you could withdraw, that would be in everybody’s best interest, or words to that effect.', '“That just set off the police and they came crashing in. As they approached me, I literally could hear police yelling, ‘Kill Davis!’ I was hit on the head and knocked to the ground. I was on the ground crawling with my two arms trying to get away and just being clubbed and clubbed and clubbed. I think what saved me that day, honestly, was a little chain fence in the park. I was able to get under the chain fence and it gave me three seconds to get away, stand up and get on the other side. I did pass out for a while.”', 'Davis went to hospital and was given 13 stitches and managed to avoid arrest. “The police realised I was seen as the organiser of this event so they came into the hospital and did a room-by-room search trying to find me to arrest me. One of the most amazing things of the impact we were having on the city is that there were nurses who literally risked their entire career.', '“This was a county hospital, they were employees of the county, and they put me on a trolley and covered me with a sheet and literally moved me from room to room to evade the police search until I could get to an exit and get out. I did, and didn’t get arrested. It really is amazing. Even today I think: wow, that was some courage there.”', 'But the incoming Richard Nixon administration successfully pushed for the purported ringleaders of the protest – including Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Tom Hayden and Davis – to be charged with conspiracy to incite a riot. They were originally the “Chicago Eight”, but the case against the Black Panther leader Bobby Seale – who was silenced in court by being bound and gagged – was eventually dropped.', 'A chaotic and raucous trial began in 1969 and forms the backbone of the Netflix movie. Davis continues: “The trial went forward with eight people and, on the opening day, the New York Times said on the front page: ‘This is the most significant political trial in American history’ – and it certainly lived up to its billing.', '“Certainly none of us want to go to prison for many years, so it’s not to say we weren’t mindful of the likely outcome, but quite honestly this was a group of people, myself included, who really saw the opportunity to basically speak to the country about the Vietnam war. We had different styles and we came from different organisations but, while the movie characterises us as squabbling and fighting a fair amount, it really wasn’t the case.”', 'When the trial ended each day at 4.30pm, the accused, out on bail, would travel far to deliver speeches to crowds of thousands of people. “This was every night with every defendant and people were stamping their feet and screaming. It was really that support of, especially, students that made such a difference.', '“We also had press conferences at the lunch break that were larger than the press conference at the White House: the entire world press was present in a massive room that could barely hold everybody. All three networks carried our story pretty much as the lead story every single day for six months.”', 'The trial lasted five and a half months. At one point all the defendants read the names of people who lost their lives in Vietnam. Five, including Davis, were found guilty of inciting a riot and all seven, plus their lawyer, were sentenced to prison terms for contempt of court. The convictions were reversed on appeal.', 'Davis became friendly with John Lennon and proposed that the onetime Beatle undertake a 42-city tour to revive the waning antiwar movement and raise funds for local causes. The first was held in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1971, but was so successful that Nixon tried to to have Lennon deported and the tour was abandoned.', 'Davis still recalls the day when Lennon took him to a recording studio in Manhattan: “Basically the entire audience is just me and Yoko and we sit there and I still don’t know what’s going to happen. John starts and he’s basically recording the final overdub of Imagine. It was really spectacular.”', 'He moved to Colorado and set up a business, consulting to chief executives of Fortune 500 companies. But his counterculture streak also saw him living alone at the bottom of the Grand Canyon for four years. “Today I teach earth whispering, how to basically deepen yourself and become more self aware and things like that. It was largely triggered by that Grand Canyon experience.”', 'Davis is played by Alex Sharp in the movie. Sorkin, known for the White House TV drama The West Wing and the Facebook origin story The Social Network, started writing the screenplay in 2007, but filming did not begin until late 2019. It is his second go in the director’s chair, following Molly’s Game in 2017.', 'Davis has mixed feelings about the finished product. “I was the coordinator of the coalition that went to Chicago and I brought back American prisoners of war from Vietnam at a time when places where I was living were being bombed by US military. In the movie, I’m made out to be a complete nerd who’s afraid of his own shadow.”', 'He adds: “Sorkin was seven years old when the trial was occurring and clearly had no understanding of the defendants or, maybe more importantly, the tens of millions of people that were just passionately supporting us.”', 'Half a century later, Donald Trump is again swimming against the tide of public opinion, according to every poll, by playing down police brutality and using the Nixon “law and order” playbook to seek re-election. Hoffman, Rubin and Hayden are no longer alive but for Davis, the echoes are inescapable. “Of course, there are very decent police officers in every state but the systemic racism in the police department just can’t be denied.', '“It’s very similar to the anti-war movement. There was a period where the protests represented a segment of society but gradually the anti-war movement came to represent the majority of society and that’s exactly what I see happening now. It is Black Lives Matter but it’s also the women’s movement and the youth movement and the environmental movement and the Extinction Rebellion movement and how they see themselves as basically being, in a way, one voice.', '“They don’t have the kind of coalition that we had in the 60s but I suspect that’s going to be coming.

But who is its secretive puppet master?', 'One Sunday in August, two weeks after Belarus’s authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko declared an implausibly decisive victory in presidential elections, I joined a crowd of around 100,000 people as it moved through central Minsk. Protest in Belarus was no longer the domain of a few hundred hardy opposition figures, and the homemade placards many people carried illustrated how broad the coalition had become: “Let’s drink to love, from the bartenders of Belarus”; “Teachers against violence”; “Working class, go on strike!”', 'The previous fortnight had been a time of national awakening, as the country united around the goal of ending Lukashenko’s 26 years in charge. As grim footage of police violence circulated on the messenger app Telegram, large numbers came out to demand that their voices be heard.', 'The enormous crowd began to flow from Independence Square, through the broad central avenues of Minsk towards a second world war memorial – because many people had received messages on their phones telling them to head there. When we arrived, the monument had been surrounded by barbed wire and placed under armed guard. Some people shouted abuse; others offered the soldiers flowers and implored them to join the side of the people. After a tense, half-hour standoff, they looked down at their phones again. Mobile internet was not working for everyone (the authorities had been switching it off at key moments) but those tech-savvy enough to install the right virtual private network (VPN) apps were able to relay the news.', 'The first place they looked was Nexta Live (pronounced “Nekhta” and meaning “someone” in Belarusian), a channel on Telegram. “Nexta says we should go towards the residence!” one man called out, joining a column of people making the short walk to Lukashenko’s official residence. Outside was a police line: cars, makeshift fences and a few hundred riot officers in balaclavas with shields. It was clear that attempting to push through would result in bloody clashes. Again, advice flashed up in the Nexta Telegram feed. “Minsk! Do not approach the police line! The best decision now is to disperse.” The crowd did just that. Since then, every Sunday, they have come out; each week, Nexta has announced the time and place of the protest a day or two before.', 'Telegram, a messaging app created by the reclusive Russian exile Pavel Durov, is suited to running protests for a number of reasons. It allows huge encrypted chat groups, making it easier to organise people, like a slicker version of WhatsApp. And its “channels” allow moderators to disseminate information quickly to large numbers of followers in a way that other messaging services do not; they combine the reach and immediacy of a Twitter feed, and the focus of an email newsletter. The combination of usability and privacy has made the app popular with protestors (it has been adopted by Extinction Rebellion) as well as people standing against authoritarian regimes (in Hong Kong and Iran, as well as Belarus); it is also used by terrorists and criminals. In the past five years, Telegram has grown at a remarkable speed, hitting 60 million users in 2015 and 400 million in April this year. Each day, another 1.5 million people sign up.', 'In Belarus, it permeates the political landscape. Opposition politicians issue press releases on a Telegram channel; journalists swap tips about where things are happening and how to avoid being detained; and people who have been tortured or beaten by Lukashenko’s thugs can find groups offering free medical or psychological support. Most importantly, Nexta Live and a number of smaller opposition channels feed subscribers with organisational information and rallying cries.', '“How can you stop these Telegram channels? Can you block them? No. Nobody can,” Lukashenko complained. But if he can’t beat Telegram, he has decided to join it instead. On the Sunday I followed protesters through Minsk, Lukashenko took off from his residence in a helicopter and flew over us. Later, his press service posted video footage, shot from inside the helicopter, to his newly created Telegram channel: the leader, dressed in black and wielding an automatic rifle, surveyed the crowds below; “They’ve scarpered like rats,” he muttered, as he peered down from the windows. Lukashenko was meant to appear uncompromising and in control, but the video was quickly copied to opposition Telegram channels, overlaid with insulting captions, voiceovers and memes, and seen there by far more. At the time of writing, Lukashenko’s channel has 86,000 subscribers, while Nexta Live has almost 2 million, an impressive feat in a country of fewer than 10 million. Last month, Belarusian authorities declared Nexta’s channel and logo to be “extremist materials” in an unsuccessful attempt to scare followers off.', 'It is a common trope for embattled autocrats to claim that protesters are in fact puppets in the hands of nefarious foreign plotters. This summer, Lukashenko suggested that his opponents were backed by the massed armies of Nato, or shadowy forces in Washington DC. But the truth is rather more embarrassing: his nemesis is a 22-year-old blogger working from a room strewn with pizza boxes 300 miles away.', 'Two weeks after that Sunday in Minsk, I meet with Stepan Svetlov at Nexta’s makeshift headquarters, inside the office of an NGO in a Warsaw apartment block. After buzzing me in, Svetlov appears at the apartment door in baggy jeans and a blue sweatshirt. There are armed police outside; unsurprisingly, given the volume of threats the group receives. “We get them all the time. They say they’re going to blow the office up, they say they’re going to kidnap us and drive us back to Belarus,” Svetlov tells me. We sit down in the room from which he and four others run Nexta. It contains a couple of computers, and a table covered with blue takeaway coffee cups.', 'Svetlov, who only recently turned 22, has not been to Belarus for two years. His parents were there until recently, but have now left the country, having been advised by friends with government contacts that things might get dangerous. “At the start of all this, my mum was quite sceptical, but now she has started to support me,” Svetlov says. Has it been a shock for his parents that their son is now seen as the revolution’s puppet master? “You could say they were quite surprised,” he says, smiling.', 'Svetlov launched Nexta as a YouTube channel in 2015, shortly before the last round of elections in Belarus. “Nobody to vote for/ Only mustachioed portraits everywhere,” ran the lyrics to a song that formed the channel’s first post. Nexta’s sharply satirical videos about Belarusian politics swelled subscriber numbers to 100,000, and quickly brought it to the attention of the authorities. A clip Svetlov made entitled “Lukasherlock”, about the Belarusian president’s claims to have solved a crime overnight, was deemed to be in potential violation of a law on insulting the president, and a criminal case was opened against him. By that time, he was studying in Poland, and he has not returned to Belarus since. In 2018, Svetlov switched his main activities from YouTube to Telegram, realising its potential to reach more people more easily.', 'As the summer’s election campaign wore on, Nexta’s popularity began to grow, partly because other bloggers who remained inside Belarus were harassed or thrown in jail. Sergei Tikhanovsky, who ran a YouTube channel and intended to stand for president, was arrested in May. In June, Igor Losik, administrator of the second biggest Belarusian Telegram channel, was also arrested. Both remain in jail. Tikhanovsky’s wife, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, eventually ran against Lukashenko as an opposition unity candidate. The dictator assumed she would give the election a veneer of legitimacy while posing no threat; but her promise to be a transitional leader ahead of new, fair elections began to energise a population desperate for change. Svetlov and his small team in Warsaw were quick to share videos from her rallies.', 'On 9 August, election day, Belarusian authorities turned off the internet almost completely as they announced the results – 80% for Lukashenko and 10% for Tikhanovskaya – to widespread disbelief and fury. After three nights of protests and ruthless police violence in response, the internet returned, a sign the authorities felt they had the situation back under control. But as detainees were freed and began to tell their stories, the Nexta team in Warsaw was deluged with horrific testimony and graphic footage of violence and injuries. I spoke to a western diplomat who told me that it is hard to overestimate Svetlov’s role in this summer’s protests, with most traditional opposition leaders jailed or forced into exile before the presidential vote: “I think he’s been the most important person of this entire period.”', 'Svetlov’s small team was overwhelmed by the volume of information coming from Belarus. “During the peak, there were about 200 messages coming every minute, or 100,000 a day. It was impossible to work through. We ignored text and just looked at photos and videos, and put the best on to the channel,” he recalls. As we speak, a young woman enters the office with a brusque, “Hi” and settles down for a shift at one of the computers, sifting through the thousands of messages, videos and tipoffs that Nexta receives each day. “You can’t talk to her, she’s still working anonymously,” Svetlov tells me, suggesting we continue our conversation in the kitchen.', 'I ask Svetlov about the Sunday I followed the crowds in Minsk, who in turn were following his directions. There were three people in the office that day, he says, tracking events in the Belarusian capital. There was no great science behind it: no complex software mapping the crowds, or algorithms to determine the numbers – simply three young people scrolling through hundreds of messages sent from the ground, and trying to determine which were the most relevant. Before major logistical information is put on the channel, it is debated in a small Telegram chat containing about 15 people, Svetlov tells me, including Nexta’s administrators and those from a few other channels.', '“We understood that people were by the war monument, and they needed to do something. Someone suggested they should go to the residence and everyone agreed, so we put it on the feed,” he says. And with that, a 22-year-old sitting in Warsaw moved a crowd of 100,000 people in Minsk.', 'None of this would have happened without Telegram’s creator, Pavel Durov. The reclusive 36-year-old Russian is ascetic in most lifestyle choices, arrogant in his interactions with others and quite brilliant at what he does. Born in St Petersburg, he learned coding in school, and immediately used it to subvert authority. According to a biography by the Russian journalist Nikolai Kononov, Durov hacked the system so that all the computers in the classroom displayed a photograph of the teacher and the caption “Must die”.', 'Later, as a student at St Petersburg State University, Durov set up a web forum for his fellow students. He did everything he could to promote it, organising real-life beauty contests that forum users could vote on, and creating controversial alter egos to ramp up controversy. “They were really juicy characters and people believed in them: an anti-feminist, a homophobe, a Stalinist,” he told Kononov. In much the same way that Mark Zuckerberg’s Harvard forum grew into Facebook, Durov and his brother Nikolai, who still work together today, turned their university website into VKontakte (meaning “in touch”). The Durovs were joined by a team of young coders, working out of the famous Singer House building in central St Petersburg, and the company grew rapidly in Russia and the former Soviet countries, partly because it also allowed users to share music and videos.', 'As VKontakte evolved into a tech giant, Durov gained a reputation as a strange, imperious figure. Obsessed with The Matrix, he saw himself, like Keanu Reeves’ character Neo, as a coder with a mission. He looks a little like a boyish Reeves, and in his rare public appearances is always dressed in black. He is a fan of grand gestures, such as a 2012 stunt in which he threw 5,000 rouble notes (then worth about £100) from the windows of Singer House and watched people scuffle on the street below.', 'But many artists were unhappy at VKontakte’s failure to take action against widespread copyright infringements on the site, and it was also slow to act on offensive material or groups, including those belonging to “Occupy Paedophilia”, an organisation that shared videos of attacks on LGBT people to its 90,000 followers on the site. Durov has a libertarian streak and has often said over the years that he values free speech above all, though to many, his unwillingness to take quick action over hate groups looked like an evasion of moral responsibility.', 'He also refused to bow to Kremlin pressure to ban opposition political groups, after protests broke out in Russia in late 2011. “This is my official answer to the security services,” he wrote on Twitter at the time, posting a photograph of a dog wearing a hoodie. As the informal relationship he had with figures around the Kremlin broke down, he was forced to sell his stake in an investment fund linked to pro-Kremlin oligarchs; and in the aftermath of the annexation of Crimea in 2014, he fled Russia, citing threats against him.', 'Durov acquired St Kitts and Nevis citizenship, and is now based in Dubai, spending long periods travelling the globe with his team of 15 or so coders in tow, often staying in hotels or rented houses. His precise movements are hard to track, and he ignored several interview requests for this article. (An associate of his tells me this is because “he has very high quality standards” and has met few journalists who lived up to them.) Instead, Durov communicates through a sporadically updated Telegram channel, where around once a month he drops his thoughts on freedom of speech, or the flaws of rival messenger services, particularly WhatsApp, which he loves to denigrate (“WhatsApp sucks”). Occasionally, the channel gives an insight into Durov’s lifestyle, such as a post last June in which he extolled the virtues of a “seagan” diet of wild fish and nothing else. He drinks no alcohol or caffeine, and claims not to have taken any pills or medicine for the past 15 years. In an October post marking his 36th birthday, he shared tips on how to stay looking young (you should live alone, for a start).', 'Since leaving Russia, Durov has focused on Telegram, the app he began developing as a way to speak securely with his brother and other associates. He has portrayed Telegram as a labour of love; it carries no advertising, and he says he has so far funded it himself, from the vast profits he made from VKontakte. A plan to launch a cryptocurrency called TON, which would have been integrated into Telegram, faltered earlier this year after the US Securities and Exchange Commission ordered the cash to be returned to investors.', 'One of the chief reasons Telegram is so beloved of protest movements is that it will run even if national regulators ban it. Used in conjunction with another app called Psiphon, it can circumvent most firewalls. Protesters in Iran used this approach to get around a government ban on Telegram in early 2018. But this loophole makes it just as useful for drug dealers, terrorists and other criminals. In Britain and many other places, one of the primary uses of Telegram is for buying drugs. In India, authorities have found Telegram has become a leading source of pirated music and film streams. Most notoriously, it also became known as the Isis app of choice. Former former prime minister Theresa May singled out Telegram in 2018 when she warned about “smaller platforms” that “can quickly become home to criminals and terrorists”.', 'According to Joshua Fisher-Birch, a researcher at the Counter Extremism Project in New York, Telegram was the forum Isis fighters used most often to communicate with each other at the height of the group’s dominance of parts of Iraq and Syria. “They felt it was a safe space, because they would not have their data shared with any government, and they also liked the ease of use,” he tells me. Durov’s explanations for why he does not lose sleep over this have been far from convincing: “Ultimately, Isis will always find a way to communicate within themselves, and if any means of communication turns out to be not secure, they’ll just switch to another one,” he said at a conference in 2015.', 'But, despite its initial reluctance to work with governments, Telegram has started taking action against terrorist-linked channels, Fisher-Birch says. In November last year, thousands of chats, bots and channels with Isis links were removed, in a joint operation with Europol, who said Telegram had gone to “considerable effort” to identify and remove Isis-linked content.', 'Earlier this year I spoke, via Telegram audio, to the administrator of a number of channels covering the Hong Kong protests, including one with more than 100,000 subscribers. Anticipating what would happen in Belarus, he told me that the organisers used channels for disseminating timely information to protesters, and the group chats for discussing their next steps. He particularly appreciated a Telegram feature that allows one user to delete a chat for both themselves and the other party, and had used it when friends had been arrested, in case police gained access to their phones.', 'He also liked the way people could be mobilised very quickly. “A big Telegram moment was at the Polytechnic University [in Hong Kong] last November, when a lot of students were trapped inside and the police were trying to attack. We used the channels to get as many people there as possible to help save them from arrest,” he told me. Although he was sure that some of the chats were infiltrated by police informants, a feature allowing users to hide their telephone numbers meant he felt more protected than on WhatsApp or other messengers. “With Telegram, we are pretty sure that we can’t be monitored by the government,” he said.', 'In Belarus, it is not just the tech-savvy youth who rely on the app. I realised this at the end of a reporting day in the provinces, when I stopped the car in a small village about an hour from Minsk, and got chatting to a 72-year-old woman who lives alone in a neat cottage. A former manager at one of Belarus’s many Soviet-built, state-run factories, Valentina is exactly the kind of person one might have expected to support Lukashenko – and she told me that until a few years ago she had, appreciating the way he had steered the country through the 90s without allowing the oligarchy and inequality that developed in neighbouring Russia and Ukraine to take hold. “If he had left 10 years ago, he would have gone down as a hero, but he has started to treat the people as though they are trash,” she said as we drank tea made from leaves she had foraged herself.', 'The transformation in Valentina’s political views began when she stopped watching state news on television and started using Telegram, which one of her grandchildren had installed for her on the chunky desktop computer in her bedroom. Now, each night before bed, she draws the orange curtains in the spotlessly tidy room and settles into an armchair at her computer desk to scroll through her Telegram feed. “It’s very addictive! I think, I’ll just take a look for half an hour, and before I know it, it’s nearly three in the morning. Which is a disaster as I have to wake up early to tend the allotment.” Almost all her friends are on Telegram, too, usually with the help of their children or grandchildren.', 'Meanwhile, the standoff in Belarus appears to have reached something of a stalemate: the Sunday protests continue, but Lukashenko remains reluctant to make concessions. A whole network of smaller Telegram chats and channels, coordinating protest in various cities, streets or even specific apartment blocks, has now appeared, creating a localised and fragmented protest movement that authorities cannot possibly crush.', 'Back in Warsaw, I ask Svetlov what comes next for Nexta. The evening before we meet, the channel had published the home address of a pro-Lukashenko official. Wasn’t this an incitement to violence? “That was not meant to exert physical pressure on him – it was more for psychological effect, so that people start thinking about their actions. We see the same thing with policemen who are scared to show their faces and hide behind masks,” he says. In the weeks after our meeting, Nexta releases the names and dates of birth of thousands of policemen, having been sent a leaked list.', 'Will Svetlov feel a sense of responsibility if the protests turn violent, given the volume of his followers? What if something happens to the people he outs on Nexta? He shrugs, with his usual half-smile, and dodges the question. “From the beginning, we saw it as a peaceful protest. It was the authorities who started the repression.”', 'As Lukashenko’s legitimacy has crumbled, he has increasingly looked to Vladimir Putin for support. While the Russian president has little affection for Lukashenko, he has even less for street protest. In the Kremlin, there has been horror at how quickly discontent has flared in a neighbouring country that appeared to be stable. Russian authorities banned the app in 2018, after Durov refused to comply with their demand that Telegram should share encryption data with the security services on request. But after two years in which millions of Russians got round the ban by using their own VPN, this June the Kremlin gave up and legalised Telegram again.', 'Still, events in Belarus show that even in the harshest of crackdowns, neutralising Telegram as a mobilising force is close to impossible. Lukashenko recently warned Putin that he, too, should be wary of Telegram: “You’re a powerful country, a nuclear country. But the Soviet Union was also a nuclear country. So you can’t relax… Through the internet, through these Telegram channels, they will get so deep into people’s brains.” The words were clearly meant to pressure Putin into continuing to prop him up, but Lukashenko might have a point – that the app, created by an exiled Russian, could one day play a similar role in Russia.', 'Recently, Svetlov inserted a poll into the Nexta Live channel to ask followers where they were based. Out of more than 700,000 respondents, over half were in Belarus, but 28% were in Russia. “When things quieten down in Belarus, we need to start reaching that Russian audience, too,” Svetlov says, smiling. “We won’t call for people to protest. But if they start, we’ll certainly cover it.”']",['Shaun Walker'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a4707fb3b7c35984bef7c046aec517c5ca801b6/0_284_2392_1434/master/2392.jpg?width=480&dpr=1&s=none', 'Telegram allows huge encrypted chat groups.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd9322e746a47d24100c2b2f411348d3676aa312/0_313_5941_3565/master/5941.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Stepan Svetlov, creator of the Nexta channel.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4d4e8bb71cbe14c70db89cc2565d712410e3f9e/0_325_8510_5107/master/8510.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Pavel Durov, founder of Telegram.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/203b8d369133590d2a81d3cbe894826317de0fda/87_451_4562_2736/master/4562.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Protests in Minsk.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fefd247b5b91ef478cc9a497d08fc53fb5558b2a/0_218_3302_1982/master/3302.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Belarus president Alexander Lukashenko (second left) in Minsk.']]",

The new data also revealed Indigenous Australians of all ages continue to be disproportionately subjected to strip searches by police.', 'The proportion of searches carried out on Indigenous Australians of all ages rose from 9% to 13% between 2018-19 and 2019-20.

In Liverpool in the city’s west, it was 10%.', '“Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should not have to live in fear of being strip searched by police. This harmful practice is eroding good community relations and feeds into distrust and fear of the police,” Lee said.', 'Police in NSW have been repeatedly criticised over the use of strip searches. Earlier this year, the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission released two separate tranches of investigations into individual searches which were found to have been unlawful.', 'The reports followed a lengthy public inquiry into the use of the policing tactic, which heard evidence of a number of potentially illegal strip searches. Among them include a 16-year-old girl who was left fearful and in tears after she was forced to strip naked in front of police at the Splendour in the Grass Festival in Byron Bay.', 'In a statement, a NSW police spokeswoman said the force would take a “considered approach” when the final report from that investigation is released later this year, and pointed to the overall reduction in strip searches and a year-on-year decline in the number of searches of children from 175 to 96.', '“A number of changes to policies, processes and training – including a new Person Search Manual, updated verification and auditing processes, and music festival procedures – have already been implemented, which have all been subject to monitoring by LECC,” the spokeswoman said.', 'The spokeswoman also defended the seven searches conducted on children aged between 11 and 14, saying they had been “reviewed and deemed to comply with policy and legislative requirements”.', 'But Vicki Sentas, a lecturer at the University of NSW – who last year co-authored a report which found that the use of drug dogs was helping to fuel massive increases in strip-searches – said the “differential policing” of Indigenous Australians revealed by the figures showed the need to reform the often-criticised legislation governing strip search powers.', '“Police leadership appear to have responded to the public backlash against strip searches by sending the message for police to ease off on music festivals,” she said.', '“None of the changes to police policy and training on strip searches have made a difference for how First Nations people are being policed and it’s only getting worse.

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/19/teacher-talk-about-racism-government-meddling-white-privilege-victim-narratives,"['With ‘white privilege’ and ‘victim narratives’ in the government’s crosshairs, we are worried about how to do our jobs', 'In October, the women and equalities minister Kemi Badenoch made a dramatic intervention in the House of Commons during a session commemorating Black History Month. Schools, she said, that teach students about certain ideas from “critical race theory” as “fact” were breaking the law: “We do not want teachers to teach their white pupils about white privilege and inherited racial guilt.”', 'The minister’s words came not too long after guidance for schools in England was published that said schools “should not use resources produced by organisations that … promote victim narratives that are harmful to British society”. It’s safe to say that these two developments, which seemed designed to have a chilling effect on discussing the uncomfortable truths of racism in Britain, have made fellow teachers and myself worried about what we can and can’t say. And the day after Badenoch’s speech, I was due to take a PSHE (personal, social, health and economic) lesson about racism.', 'Most of the students in my class are white, so before we even started the lesson, I knew that the racial status of whiteness in a white-majority society was going to come up. I felt unsure as to my role – I hadn’t had time yet to absorb Badenoch’s statement – but the intelligence and inquisitiveness of my students led the way. “Can you be racist towards white people, because I told my friend that you can’t?”, asked one. Others began sharing their experiences. A black student talked about how their family members had been stopped by the police in town. Two non-white students explained how a teacher got them mixed up for a year. There was no point during the lesson when any of the white students shared experiences of racism. Isn’t that discrepancy in their experiences an example of “white privilege” in action?', 'Schools are complex ecosystems. You might be dealing with more than 1,000 students and several hundred staff members. It became evident to me that there were many members of staff who didn’t know or maybe even care about the issues raised during Black History Month. I know that one member of staff said, “All lives matter” at one point, while another drew a false equivalence between Black Lives Matter and the BNP. This highlights both the importance of educating staff about race, as well as the fact that schools are contested spaces for social issues.', 'Now we are faced with the dilemma of how to teach vitally important concepts without breaking government guidance. Colleagues often have the same worrying scenario in mind: they try to have a nuanced conversation about “whiteness” or the legacy of white supremacy, and a student goes home and tells their parents that they’re learning about how racism is their fault. The government says it is against teaching certain ideas, as if they were “accepted facts”. But no concept in the social sciences is uncontested and surely Badenoch knows this, so the real consequences of her words is probably going to be a chilling effect. I am also unsure specifically what constitutes “critical race theory” or “victim narratives”, from the government’s point of view, and so feel apprehensive about the content of some lessons in the coming weeks.', 'I don’t want to be complicit in papering over the realities of racism by avoiding these topics for fear of repercussions from senior staff and the wider community, but I also don’t want to put my job at risk. As teachers, we have a responsibility and duty to our students to provide them with comprehensive support and guidance to give them the best chances when they leave school. Race issues and racism are extremely prevalent in our students’ lives, and children are going to have questions. “But why, Miss?” and “Yeah, but how do you know, Sir?” pop up frequently in all lessons. Am I meant to discourage a conversation about stop and search when the only teenager in the room to have experienced this is black and their white peers want to understand why?', 'There needs to be more resources and training to equip teachers to deliver good teaching on diversity-based topics – I know I am not the only teacher who feels that. I want to see diversity training made a compulsory part of teacher-training programmes; it should be given a similar priority as safeguarding training. Rather than shutting down these conversations and topics, educators should be better equipped to explore these issues in the classroom without fear or ignorance. Creating a climate in which teachers feel it’s safer to avoid these topics of conversation doesn’t make these questions go away – it will force students to go elsewhere in search of answers.', 'The author teaches in a secondary school in England']",[],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40a42a2299a6b44456b74732a4d05bedfced62e0/352_149_4466_2681/master/4466.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'Children and a teacher in a classroom']]",
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/15/undercover-police-abuse-new-intelligence-bill,"['The new intelligence bill will do nothing to protect the innocent campaigners who’ve been wrongly targeted by covert officers', 'I am due to give evidence to the official inquiry into undercover policing early next year, as a “non-police, non-state core participant”. I was targeted by undercover officers for some 30 years, including when I was an MP.', 'This week the government’s new covert human intelligence sources bill is being debated in parliament. What troubles me most about this issue, however, is the clear abuses practised by undercover officers involving people I know well.', 'Kate Wilson was at primary school in London with my two sons. Our families shared holidays. She is not a criminal; she is a principled ecological activist. But she was targeted by undercover officer Mark Kennedy, who formed an intimate and what she afterwards described as “abusive” relationship with her over seven years. Kennedy even reported back to his superiors on contacts with my family when I was a cabinet minister. But why were police targeting Kate in the first place? Do they view green campaigners the same way they see drug barons, human traffickers, criminals and terrorists?', 'Doreen Lawrence, now a fellow Labour peer, was a law-abiding citizen when her family’s campaign to discover the truth about her son Stephen’s brutal murder was infiltrated by undercover officers. Why were they instead not targeting the racist thugs who killed him?', 'Undercover officers attended anti-apartheid meetings in my parents’ living room from the late 1960s to the early 70s; and, later, they reported back that I had spoken at anti-racist events when I was an MP in the early 1990s. Again, why were they not targeting the criminal and oppressive actions of the apartheid state responsible for, among other things, firebombings in London?', 'Why did they show no interest whatsoever in discovering who in South Africa’s Bureau of State Security was responsible for sending me a letter bomb, in June 1972, capable of blowing my family and our London home to smithereens? Thankfully there was a technical fault in the trigger mechanism.', 'Why were they not targeting Nazi groups responsible for attacks on black, Jewish and Muslim people, instead of spying on the Anti-Nazi League?', 'In each of these cases, the police were on the wrong side of justice, on the wrong side of the law, and on the wrong side of history. Infiltrating the family of a climate-change activist instead of helping combat climate change. Covering up for a racist murder instead of catching the murderers. Harassing activists campaigning for Nelson Mandela’s freedom instead of pursuing crimes committed by the apartheid state.', 'There was also a systematic pattern of deceit and exaggeration by undercover officers. The man known as “Mike Ferguson” claimed to be my “number two” when I chaired the 1969-70 campaign to stop tours by all-white apartheid rugby and cricket teams. This was a straight lie. I had no “number two” – and if he is the person I vaguely recollect, he was on the periphery of those around me.', 'Ferguson and other undercover officers claimed our campaign intended to attack the police at Twickenham. A lie. They claimed we planned to sprinkle tin tacks on the pitch. Another lie: we ran on to pitches in acts of nonviolent direct action and were always at pains to avoid personal injury to players – though sometimes we were beaten up ourselves by rugby stewards or police. Undercover officers also played agent provocateur on occasion, daring militant but nonviolent protesters into criminal activity.', 'Fortunately, Kate Wilson’s early eco-activism helped pave the way to the Paris climate agreement. We stopped the 1970 all-white cricket tour, and helped bring down apartheid. The Anti-Nazi League, of which I was a founding national officer, succeeded in destroying the far-right National Front. But why were undercover police officers trying to disrupt us, diverting precious police resources away from catching criminals?', 'I do believe there can be a need for undercover officers. When I was Northern Ireland secretary from 2005 to 2007, I met undercover officers doing brave work trying to prevent dissident IRA groups from killing and maiming. I also signed surveillance warrants to prevent Islamist terrorists bombing London.', 'But where to draw the line? How do you stop legitimate undercover police or intelligence work sliding into the illegitimate? Even in our era of modern reforms – including legislative accountability for the first time – police and security chiefs have made a habit of getting it wrong. Putting nonviolent Extinction Rebellion on a list of terrorist groups hardly inspires confidence.', 'The covert intelligence bill doesn’t even begin to answer any of these key questions. Unless it is amended it will pose a serious threat to liberty and will be an invitation for action-replays of the malevolent use of undercover security work to disrupt human rights, anti-racist and environmental campaigns.', 'Peter Hain is a former Labour MP and cabinet minister.
