Youth strikers organised record-breaking mass mobilisations and protests between geography and double maths. In the US, young people from the Sunrise Movement occupied Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office demanding climate action. Youth activists got extraordinary media attention, invitations to speak at climate summits, and to address the UN. Teenagers such as Vanessa Nakate and Greta Thunberg became household names; both of them appeared on the cover of Time magazine, the latter as person of the year in 2019.\\nThis coincided with a moment in climate politics that was awash with ideas around children, the future, and intergenerational justice. Extinction Rebellion activists used the next generation as a proxy for the future: climate action in the present was a moral necessity for our children and grandchildren. Politicians also adopted this framing. At the same time, young people were taking matters into their own hands. For a time, it seemed that a climate movement was emerging in which children acted simultaneously as the spark, inspiration and energy. This wave seemed unstoppable.\\nBut that moment has passed. Young people\u2019s climate activism is rarely headline news any more and Thunberg has taken a step back from the movement spotlight. There are fewer older eco-warriors in the limelight talking about their grandchildren, and politicians seem to care less about photo-ops with young activists blocking roads.\\nOf course, youth organising has not simply disappeared \u2013 young people still populate much of the activist scene and movements such as Green New Deal Rising remain explicitly for under-35s. But media focus and activists themselves are placing less emphasis on age; it is often incidental, and less central to activists\u2019 strategy.\\nThe political terrain has changed since the age of the youth activist icon. The events of the past couple of years have thrown down challenges for climate organising more broadly: the pandemic was a major chiller for activism and came hot on the heels of the 2019 general election, the biggest Tory victory since 1987 and a crushing experience for the left and wider green movement.\\nBut the climate movement is not just moving across a different political landscape; it has also taken a different form. There has been a critical repositioning in parts of the UK climate movement, recognising climate breakdown is not a future issue, but a devastating present reality for millions in the global south. And on the whole, young activists have grown out of organising along generational lines, instead moving into issue-oriented movements.\\nFrom the beginning, youth strikers were holding together a complex coalition of children, allied around their age and the tactic of striking, rather than an explicit political agenda. After sustaining impressive turnout at protests but achieving little political shift, UK organisers were burning out, as was the shock of the strikes.\\nThis was compounded by the feeling that world leaders and corporations were \u201cyouth-washing\u201d by co-opting child climate activists \u2013 inviting them on to platforms and into private meetings to burnish their own images but ignoring their demands. Despite the increase in representation on the world stage, importantly including indigenous young people and children from the global south, it\u2019s hard to say how much world leaders took their voices into account. Children were seen, but their demands \u2013 from urging for financing for loss and damage, an end to the racist Home Office or an end to capitalism itself \u2013 were not heard. The UK Youth Climate Coalition was so frustrated with this co-optation it set up a campaign in 2019 to call out youth-washing.\\nSome adults were youth-washing to cover their problematic policies or business models, others to divest action on to a younger generation. Thunberg spoke out about it in her now-famous speech to the UN: \u201cYou all come to us young people for hope. How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\u201d Ultimately, what is lacking is real decision-making power for young people.\\nSo now, instead of using youth as a rallying flag, young people across the country are building movements around radical policies or clear political campaigns. These are both harder to co-opt, and more coherent than the loose association of a movement based on age alone. Given the fragmented politics and the fleeting nature of childhood itself, building youth-led movements around strong campaign foundations \u2013 from Stop Jackdaw to Just Stop Oil \u2013 is proving more sustainable.\\nThe climate movement still needs powerful ideas and metaphors that can unite big coalitions, but children are no longer its future. That focus was temporary, and besides kept attention off the millions for whom climate breakdown isn\u2019t the future but the present. It\u2019s a good thing that young activists are now viewed less as angelic saviours, and more as political actors in their own right.\\nEleanor Salter writes about climate, culture and politics", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e472577e3ccbd84621ae93ebf7116badb83b86d/0_157_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Just Stop Oil activists sit on top of a fuel tanker during a protest in Grays, Essex, 15 April 2022.

He campaigned on an understanding that climate risks threatened the future of the planet and of humanity, and therefore required a society-wide mobilisation at an emergency scale and speed. Sutton argued that getting into emergency mode rapidly was the central challenge for the climate movement.\\nThis understanding was expounded in his 2008 book Climate Code Red: the Case for Emergency Action, written with David Spratt, which codified the term \u201cclimate emergency\u201d, and shocked many readers into becoming climate activists. The book played a major role in shifting the narrative on the level of climate risk and our required response. Climate Code Red\u2019s risk and impact assessments and climate system repair fundamentals have since been validated by mainstream analysis.\\nSutton was at the forefront of environmental activism in Australia for more than 40 years. He was an assistant director of the Conservation Council of Victoria (now Environment Victoria) and worked as a councillor for the Australian Conservation Foundation from 1973 to 1976, and again from 2009 to 2015. In 1978 he co-authored Seeds for Change, a detailed alternative energy strategy for Victoria.\\nHis influence and associations extended across a wide range of innovative environmental and climate organisations including Breakthrough \u2013 National Centre for Climate Restoration, Beyond Zero Emissions, Council and Community Action in the Climate Emergency, Sustainable Living Foundation, the Australia New Zealand Society for Ecological Economics and many more.\\nHe was an initiating member of the movement that led Darebin city council in Melbourne to become the first local council in the world to declare a climate emergency, and played a leading role in the international campaign that has resulted in more than 1,000 local, regional and national governments to follow suit.\\nSutton emphasised the need for climate strategy to be based on a clear, if discomforting analysis of the physical evidence of climate change, and for an approach to risk no less rigorous than those applied in areas such as engineering and aviation. He railed against the 2C \u201csafe-warming limit\u201d adopted by most climate advocates and institutions. Such a result would amount to \u201ca death sentence for billions of people and millions of species\u201d, Sutton argued.\\nNormalising goal setting based on the protection of \u201call people, all species and all generations\u201d or \u201cmaximum protection\u201d, was a framework which he pursued with tireless dedication.\\nSutton\u2019s ability to synthesise big-picture thinking with attention to detail, as well as his personal enthusiasm and generosity, were remembered in many of the tributes paid after his death.\\nThe Greens senator Janet Rice said Sutton was \u201can intellectual giant\u201d whose \u201cabsolute passion and dedication for a safe climate was unparalleled\u201d.\\nPaul Gilding, former chief executive of Greenpeace International, called Sutton a \u201cgroundbreaking thinker\u201d, while Mark Ogge of the Australia Institute said he was \u201cextraordinary, incredibly influential in focusing us on the urgency of climate change\u201d.\\nThe former Victorian Labor environment minister Gavin Jennings said Sutton\u2019s death was \u201cdevastatingly sad\u201d.\\n\u201cPhilip dedicated his life to mobilise citizens, institutions and government to take the urgent actions required to keep life on this planet.\u201d\\nPhilip Sutton was born in Sydney on 2 May 1951. The greatest influence on him in his early years was his mother, Fay, who became an environmental activist serving on the Australian Conservation Foundation\u2019s Council for more than 30 years. His father, Ralph, was an officer in the Australian Army and, as a result of his role, the family moved around a lot until they settled in Sydney where, as a teenager, Philip attended Sydney Boys High.\\nHe studied veterinary science at the University of Sydney in the late 1960s, but abandoned his degree in order to pursue urban creek protection and other local environmental causes.\\nIn his early career, Sutton initiated the campaign that led to the banning of nuclear power in Victoria in 1983. He was the architect of the groundbreaking Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee legislation passed in 1988, the first of its kind, which became the model for the revision of wildlife legislation around Australia. He also worked on the federal government\u2019s endangered species advisory committee (1990-93), the Victorian government energy strategy (1982-83), the Victorian state conservation strategy (1983-84), and with the Victorian Office of the Environment to develop strategies for achieving a successful green economy (1991).\\nSutton met his former partner, the conservationist Kathy Preece, in the late 1980s, and they worked together on leading environmental legislation. They had two sons, Daniel and Joey, and as a family delighted in spending time together and exploring the wonders and science of the natural world.\\nSutton\u2019s dogged yet warm, genuine and unpretentious nature won the respect of many he worked with, even while he put forward confronting realities.\\nThe former Greens leader Christine Milne said: \u201cI had enormous respect for his intellect, his commitment and his courage to keep on telling it how it is, no matter how much that made people feel uncomfortable.\u201d\\nSutton is survived by Daniel and Joey.

It\u2019s still looking to oil and gas for the answer when that is precisely what is driving the cost of living and climate crises.\u201d\\nJackdaw is just the latest major UK fossil fuel project to have been approved since the UK hosted the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow last year \u2013 to the dismay of climate scientists and campaigners.\\nEarlier this month a Guardian investigation found the world\u2019s biggest fossil fuel firms were quietly planning 195 \u201ccarbon bombs\u201d \u2013 huge oil and gas projects that would drive the climate past internationally agreed temperature limits with catastrophic global impacts.\\nIn April, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, gave a warning to fossil fuel corporations and governments planning new extraction projects. \u201cInvesting in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness,\u201d he said. \u201cClimate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals.

In its annual giving report, Exxon Mobil, the largest oil company in the US, said it supported the American Friends of Policy Exchange, along with several other organisations, because they \u201cassess public policy alternatives on issues of importance to the petroleum and petrochemical industries\u201d. The donation was given for \u201cenergy and environment\u201d, the name of a policy area listed on the thinktank\u2019s website.\\nIn 2019, XR activists \u201clocked on\u201d to the London underground, stopping commuters from getting to work, and brought much of the capital to a halt while asking for action on the climate crisis. At the time, the government was under pressure from sections of the press and the public to crack down on the climate protesters.\\nPatel has said that the new bill is devised to stop \u201cmobs\u201d such as Extinction Rebellion from \u201crunning riot\u201d and includes measures to criminalise methods used by environment campaigners, such as \u201clocking on\u201d to infrastructure.\\nPaul Stott, the head of security and extremism at Policy Exchange, wrote in a recent blog that the bill was evidence that some of the thinktank\u2019s recommendations to deal with \u201cthe mechanics of the deliberate disruption of the public square\u201d were being followed by the government.\\nCivil rights groups have condemned the government\u2019s plans, with Amnesty International UK saying that they are comparable to \u201crepressive policies\u201d used in Russia, Hong Kong and Belarus.\\nA spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion claimed the government was \u201cbeing directed by thinktanks working for fossil fuel clients, meaning our laws are being written for the benefit of foreign oil and gas corporations\u201d.

We\u2019re building towards a terrific evening on the Pyramid: Wolf Alice, Robert Plant & Alison Krauss, Sam Fender and Billie Eilish.\\nWe\u2019re asking people where they\u2019d take Macca for his 80th birthday party, after he reached the milestone last weekend. Here\u2019s Naomi, who has two gin-in-a-tins on the go just as the Glasto gods intended:\\nArcadia, it\u2019s such a unique space. The spider is such an iconic piece of architecture, it brings a lot of people together for some world famous DJ sets. Or the Rabbit Hole \u2013 another iconic venue and it\u2019s quite secret so I think he would have a pretty good time in there.

I feel like it\u2019s more secluded so you could have more of a private chill. I assume he\u2019s probably a fan of the Clash!\\nMore great lewks, this time from Crae Wolf who just played the Lonely Heart Club stage:\\nIt\u2019s part of my look, my stage wear. Leather always, fishnets a must, it has to be black and red, they\u2019re my favourite colours. The knee wrap, I always have one, I don\u2019t know why \u2013 it\u2019s very festive. Punk boots. Basically as an artist I like to express my music in my fashion. I consider myself a supervillain so these are my villain colours. It\u2019s part of my music, my brand. The villain is always the bad guy but they\u2019re misunderstood \u2013 they\u2019re usually good until something happens in life that changes their perspective. I\u2019m harnessing the dark energy!\\nGreenpeace, 15.30\\nIt\u2019s this Surrey-born, Croydon-raised singer-songwriter\u2019s debut Glastonbury performance and she gives her crowd a warning: \u201cI sing a lot about heartbreak so get ready: we\u2019re going to get through it together.\u201d\\nIndeed, Rachel Chinouriri\u2019s brand of sweet and folksie strumming and sombre vocals \u2013 she\u2019s performing as a duo with a lone guitarist and backing track today \u2013 is as low-key and downbeat as it gets. Her songs, many of which share the delicacy of Lianne La Havas\u2019s Paper Thin, positively vibrate with loneliness and are often spoken about in the same breath as \u201cnurturing\u201d and \u201chealing\u201d.\\nNot that all the sadness puts the crowd off. After a shaky start, with the title track from her latest EP Better Off Without, she limbers up for the Phoebe Bridgers-ish Falling Out of Love and Thank You for Nothing, a song she says is about growing up around alcohol abuse. It\u2019s not all doom and gloom, either: her big one, All I Asked, a perky poppier song with chiming guitar, is where her falsetto truly shines.\\nAlso shining is the stage patter. Chinouriri speaks to her young audience like she\u2019s sharing secrets in her bedroom, dishing out empowering advice, explaining the stories behind her songs and generally beaming out warmth. \u201cYou want people to look back at you and think, they shared so much love,\u201d she says at one point. Macca would approve.\\nWe\u2019re situated between Crowded House on the Pyramid stage and a drum\u2019n\u2019bass DJ set, which is weirdly syncing up as a junglist re-edit of Weather With You. Here\u2019s Neil Finn:\\nHere\u2019s our reviewer Tara Joshi: \u201cJust met a man called Huw Joseph, he\u2019s dressed as a pi\u00f1ata \u2013 if you hit him he throws you sweets. Lots to unpack.\u201d\\nThe Park stage, 14.00\\nAt the time Wet Leg were booked for Glasto, 2pm at the Park Stage probably seemed a perfectly appropriate slot \u2013 but this fun rock band have blown up so massively that half the site was crammed into the field, trying to catch a glimpse of Rhian and Hester playing in their flowing cottagecore dresses. The crowd easily rivals that for the Libertines on the Other Stage earlier today, which is not bad for a band with just one album.\\nOpener Feels Like Being in Love gets everyone going despite the fact that half the crowd can barely hear what\u2019s going on, and they follow it up with Wet Dream, which has thousands yelling along cheerfully to its bouncy, mildly obscene chorus hook.\\nThe most endearing thing about this band is that they genuinely seem to be doing all this for a laugh. If anything, they seem mildly perplexed by the fact that so many people have turned up to see them play at one of the world\u2019s biggest music festivals. \u201cThis is so funny,\u201d says Rhian at one point, before dissolving into silent giggles as the crowd noisily responds. Ur Mum \u2013 a greatly entertaining stream of musical insults punctuated by the band\u2019s longest, loudest scream \u2013 gets a great live reaction, as does Too Late Now, whose peevish speeded-up middle verse hits perfectly: \u201cI don\u2019t need no dating app / To tell me if I look like crap / To tell me if I\u2019m thin or fat / To tell me should I shave my rat.\u201d\\nThey run through pretty much the entire album and it\u2019s pretty incredible how many of these songs are just instant indie hits. They save their breakthrough song for last: Chaise Longue, a mildly surreal banger that perfectly captures the band\u2019s singalong cheeky, playfulness: \u201cIs your muffin buttered? Would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?\u201d Cries of \u201cExcuse me? WHAT\u201d reverberate back and forth across the Park for ages afterwards.\\nRhian and Hester keep a tight set \u2013 even when they briefly forget the words to Angelica \u2013 and seem surprised and amused to be playing their silly stoner songs for such an enormous audience. They could have filled a much bigger stage here, and after another album, I have no doubt they will.\\nWe\u2019ll periodically be checking in with Glastonbury\u2019s best/wildest dressed \u2013 here\u2019s Marta who has one cardinal fashion rule: \u201cI don\u2019t wear black\u201d. She says that festival fashion should always be \u201ccolourful and fun\u201d; her jacket comes from Poland but she says she has \u201cno idea what the letters mean\u201d.\\nOther stage, 14.15\\nJust wandered from Blossoms which I couldn\u2019t see all of, but they had a wonderfully full sound and there was a vast crowd (possibly with some spillover from people who couldn\u2019t get to Wet Leg). It\u2019s sort of remarkable how they, Harry Styles, George Ezra, Declan McKenna and so many more nice boys of pop trade in a type of 1970s AOR that a previous generation of young people found utterly naff \u2013 but the crowd was full of kids in limited edition streetwear. It\u2019s actually a rather refreshing demonstration of how concepts of youth cultural cool have all melted into today\u2019s anything-goes attitude.\\nOh, and Mel C turned up in full Sporty Spice mode to do Spice Up Your Life!\\nBlossoms and Mel C doing Spice Up Your Life at Glastonbury \ud83d\udc96 \ud83d\ude2d pic.twitter.com/vkiKNvTqpn\\nIn an \u201conly at Glastonbury\u201d moment I stumbled across probably three hundred people dressed in pink and waving pink umbrellas, up by the tree at the back end of the Pyramid stage. Turns out they\u2019re a drinking society called TWFTPU who meet up every year. They had their own pink vodka, wristbands, stickers, hand stamps and everything.\\nThis is Sam who says: \u201cWe used to meet at the cider bar about eight years ago, and someone said: next year bring a pink umbrella so you know who\u2019s in the party. It\u2019s an icebreaker. All weekend you stand about drinking on your tod, don\u2019t you, but you can go up and say: random stranger, do you want to do this? It seems to be working.
