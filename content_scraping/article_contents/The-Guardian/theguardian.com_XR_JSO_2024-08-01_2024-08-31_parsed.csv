You have appointed yourselves as the sole arbiters of what should be done about climate change, bound neither by the principles of democracy nor the rule of law.', '“And your fanaticism makes you entirely heedless of the rights of your fellow citizens. You have taken it upon yourselves to decide that your fellow citizens must suffer disruption and harm, and how much disruption and harm they must suffer, simply so that you may parade your views.”', 'Although all of the defendants ended the trial representing themselves, three of them – Hallam, Shaw and Whittaker De Abreu – instructed counsel to speak on their behalf in mitigation.', 'Each barrister sought unsuccessfully to persuade the judge that lengthy sentences could be avoided. Francesca Cociani, for Shaw, said the likelihood of his reoffending was lowered by the fact that the new Labour government had essentially met Just Stop Oil’s core demand by ending North Sea oil and gas exploration.', 'Gethin, who offered her own comments in mitigation, said: “I want to remind the court once more that my reasons for taking action were not beliefs or opinions. Earth’s life-support systems are breaking down due to human activities, whether we believe it or not.', '“These are not beliefs or opinions and feeling strongly that this is wrong is greatly understandable, I would argue. I deeply regret that this action was necessary … I maintain that it was necessary and I stand by my actions as the most effective option available to me.”', 'Supporters of the defendants expressed outrage at the sentences, which came after a two-week trial in which the judge denied them any of the defences in law for causing a public nuisance.', 'Hehir ruled that the jury should not take into account evidence about climate breakdown, which the defendants wanted to point to as the key motivation behind their actions, and which they said provided them with a reasonable excuse for them.', 'Michel Forst, the UN’s special rapporteur on environmental defenders, who attended part of the trial, issued a statement at its conclusion.', '“Today is a dark day for peaceful environmental protest” in the UK, he said. “This sentence should shock the conscience of any member of the public. It should also put all of us on high alert on the state of civic rights and freedoms in the United Kingdom.', '“Rulings like today’s set a very dangerous precedent, not just for environmental protest but any form of peaceful protest that may, at one point or another, not align with the interests of the government of the day.”', 'Greenpeace UK’s programme director, Amy Cameron, said: “What sort of country locks people away for years for planning a peaceful demonstration, let alone for talking about it on a Zoom call? We’re giving a free hand to the polluting elite robbing us of a habitable planet while jailing those who’re trying to stop them – it makes no sense.', '“These sentences are not a one-off anomaly but the culmination of years of repressive legislation, overblown government rhetoric and a concerted assault on the right of juries to deliberate according to their conscience. It’s part of the mess the Labour government has inherited from its predecessor and they must fix it by giving back to people the right to protest that’s been slowly being taken away from them.”', 'Separately on Thursday, three airports were granted high court injunctions against fossil fuel and environmental activists protesting at their sites.

A fifth defendant, Roger Hallam, was sentenced to five years by a judge who said he “sat at the very highest level of the conspiracy”.', 'Forst, whose role is to protect individuals facing penalisation, persecution, or harassment for exercising their environmental rights, attended two days of the trial earlier this month as he attempted to intervene with UK authorities on behalf of Shaw. He called the jail terms “punitive and repressive”.', '“We are really shocked by what’s happening in the UK in the case of Daniel Shaw,” Forst told the Guardian on Friday. “He has already spent more than 100 days on remand. Now, to hear that he’s been sentenced to four years in prison, that’s really shocking.', '“Even if we are talking about a disruptive form of protest, and there is no denying that, it is still entirely non-violent and it should have been treated as such. For me, for my team, it’s not acceptable in a democracy like the UK.', '“The second element is that it’s a very dangerous ruling, not only for environmental protesters, but also for the right to protest as such, because we understand now that those who would like to go to the street to demonstrate, to organise a rally, they would consider twice before going out.', '“That’s a deterrent for the right to protest in the UK.”', 'He said he was in discussions to visit the UK in the autumn, and that he hoped to meet the new attorney general, Richard Hermer, to discuss the case “but more broadly what’s happening with the right to protest and democracy in the UK”.', 'A host of human rights campaigners joined Forst in decrying the sentences. Sam Grant, director of advocacy at Liberty, said what appeared to be a trend for increasingly severe sentences for non-violent protest indicated “a grave erosion of … freedoms” in the UK. Hanna Hindstrom, who investigates rights abuses against environmental defenders for Global Witness, said the “incredibly harsh” sentences were “a profound injustice”.', 'And Tom Southerden, Amnesty International UK’s human rights adviser, called on the government to repeal the portions of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 that legislated the statutory offence of public nuisance used against the defendants.', '“Today’s draconian sentences and the manner in which the trial was conducted show that the hardline anti-protest approach adopted by the previous government is being emulated by the courts,” Southerden said.', 'But on Friday, government officials said ministers would not intervene. Pressed on whether Labour would look again at anti-protest laws it opposed before entering government, Starmer’s spokeswoman said: “The prime minister is very clear that when it comes to these cases, the judgments and sentencing is for independent judges to make them, they’ve had all the facts and evidence before them.', 'Sign up to Down to Earth', ""The planet's most important stories.

Fundamentally, [it is] not for politicians to interfere and opine on decisions that have been taken by judges.”', 'The government was nevertheless coming under growing pressure to look again at the controversial laws, which critics said have led to increasingly draconian action against climate activists.', 'Even Doughty Street Chambers, where the prime minister practised as a barrister, pointed out “there was no irony lost” in the fact that public nuisance, when a common law offence, was formerly often used to prosecute polluters, while “the same offence in statutory form is now being zealously deployed to prosecute environmental protesters”.', 'Dale Vince, the green entrepreneur, who stepped away from bankrolling Just Stop Oil to become one of the Labour party’s most significant donors, joined the broadcasters Chris Packham and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall in echoing calls for a meeting with Hermer about the protesters’ case.', '“I think climate denial should be illegal, but instead it’s illegal to talk about the climate crisis in court,” Vince said. “Now five peaceful protesters could face years in jail as a result of this perverse ruling. It’s a travesty of justice and that’s why I’m joining the calls for the new attorney general to intervene.”', 'Clive Lewis, MP for Norwich South, called for action “as a matter of some urgency”, adding: “I will be backing calls for a meeting with the attorney general, I think that needs to happen with some urgency, I will be addressing this in parliament.” He called for the laws “which have allowed this to happen” to be “consigned to the dustbin of history”.', 'Siân Berry, the Green MP, said the sentences were “a hangover from the last government’s obsession with punishing … non-violent, peaceful protests”. They highlighted a challenge for the new government, she added, and Labour must “review the guidelines given to judges that have led to such extreme, disproportionate sentences for peaceful protest”.', 'On Friday, their views appeared to resonate with the public at large.

They sought to turn Hehir’s court into a “site of civil resistance”, causing as much disruption as necessary to ensure that if the jury could not see their evidence on climate breakdown, then the jurors could at least be in no doubt it was being kept from them.', 'By the time the jury retired to consider a verdict, police had been called into court no fewer than seven times, four of the five defendants had been remanded to prison and 11 others were facing contempt of court proceedings for protests outside the courtroom.', 'Roger Hallam, Daniel Shaw, Louise Lancaster, Lucia Whittaker De Abreu and Cressida Gethin were standing trial on charges of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance, accused of being the “queen bees” behind a series of protests on the M25.', 'Under the banner of the climate campaign group Just Stop Oil, already notorious for its road-blocking protests, they were said to have recruited 64 people to climb gantries over London’s orbital motorway, forcing police to stop traffic on four consecutive days.', 'The prosecution said the disruption amounted to £750,000 of economic damage and a £1m policing cost, with about 709,000 drivers affected. The judge warned the defendants they faced a harsh penalty if convicted.', 'Two men who blocked the Queen Elizabeth II bridge the month before the gantry protests were jailed for two years each, sentences Hehir said he would take as a reference point.', 'But why was Forst there in the first place? What can only now be reported is that he had made an extraordinary intervention on the eve of the trial, issuing a public statement criticising the treatment of Shaw in particular. As he awaited trial, Shaw had already spent more than 100 days on remand, been forced to wear an ankle tag, made subject to a strict curfew and banned from meeting his co-defendants or attending environmental demonstrations.', 'Forst’s intervention came amid increasing alarm at tightening restrictions on protest rights. In the past two years, the UK government has passed two wide-ranging laws targeting direct actions by climate activists, creating a host of new offences with potentially stiff penalties. At the same time, with juries having repeatedly acquitted defendants prosecuted for climate and other protests on the basis that their cause was just, the attorney general had applied to the court of appeal to limit the kinds of defences available in such cases.', 'Forst had already written to the UK government to express concern over these developments, but issued his latest statement after getting no response. “I fail to see how exposing Mr Shaw to a multiyear prison sentence for being on a Zoom call that discussed the organisation of a peaceful environmental protest is either reasonable or proportionate, nor pursues a legitimate public purpose,” Forst wrote. “Rather, I am gravely concerned that a sanction of this magnitude is purely punitive and repressive.”', 'That Zoom call was a key piece of evidence for the prosecution case. Made just days before the M25 protests began, the call was, the prosecution said, part of efforts to recruit volunteers to take part in the direct actions. Unbeknown to those taking part, it had been infiltrated by a Sun journalist who recorded it and passed it to the Metropolitan police.', 'On the face of it, the prosecution evidence seemed damning – and was mostly uncontested by the defendants. But it was only after prosecutors completed their case that events in court began to get really interesting.', 'The defendants had wanted to mount a defence of reasonable excuse. They proposed inviting expert witnesses such as the geophysicist Bill McGuire, who has written extensively on the implications of climate breakdown, to explain why the urgency of the unfolding environmental crisis warranted their actions. Such defence strategies have worked in some previous cases, with defendants acquitted in the face of apparently conclusive evidence.', 'But Hehir ruled that the defendants in this case could not present any evidence about the climate to the court, save for the brief statements about their philosophical and political beliefs that ultimately would have no bearing on the verdict.', 'It was in this context that, as the second week of the trial began, protesters began appearing each morning outside the court, displaying placards saying: “Jurors deserve to hear the whole truth.”', 'Of the defendants, only Hallam disputed the role the prosecution claimed he played in the conspiracy. He told the court he had merely been asked to “give the case for civil disobedience”.', '“I wish to say on oath that I was not involved in this campaign,” he said. However, he went on to argue that even if the jury determined he had played a role in the conspiracy, they should find him and his co-defendants not guilty on the basis they had a reasonable excuse or justification for the actions they took.', 'In a three-hour address, punctuated by interruptions from an irritated Hehir, Hallam lectured the jury on his interpretation of the law, and why, he claimed, it showed the activists had an excuse for blocking the M25 to raise the alarm about climate breakdown.', 'Hehir told jurors Hallam’s legal analysis was peppered with mistakes. He repeatedly sent the jury out to admonish Hallam for referencing climate science he had ruled irrelevant to the case. But the judge proved more patient than the defendant seemed to expect. In the end, Hallam told jurors: “I apologise to you if I’m a little bit incoherent, I didn’t actually expect that I was going to get this far.”', 'He did not get much further. The following morning, the judge brought Hallam’s evidence to an end and, after the defendant refused to answer a cross-examination and then refused to leave the witness box, insisting he was not finished, Hehir called police into the court and had him arrested for contempt.', '“Democracy in action, guys! Democracy in action,” Hallam said to watching reporters, as he was dragged into the dock, then down to the cells.', 'It was the first of many such scenes. Later that same day, Shaw was arrested and taken to the cells in almost identical circumstances, and Hehir sent jurors – who had not witnessed the arrests – home early. “I have never had to order a defendant to be arrested in a courtroom before and I’m very sad to have had to do that not once, but twice today,” the judge said.', 'On the face of it, Hallam and Shaw’s theatrics looked self-defeating. But the defendants believed they contributed to a victory. The following morning, on agreement, four “facts not in dispute” relating to the climate crisis were read into the court record by Fiona Robertson, second barrister for the crown. They were: that the climate crisis was “an existential threat to humanity”; that global heating above 1.5C would have catastrophic consequences; that in the past 12 months average global temperatures were 1.6C above the pre-industrial baseline; and that in October 2022 the government had opened a new round of oil and gas licensing.', 'It was a development the defendants and their supporters said amounted to the prosecution conceding the climate crisis was “an existential threat to humanity” – and one that they were to refer to throughout the remaining days of the trial.', 'Forst was in court to see this. He also witnessed much else. Hallam, bailed the previous day, was dragged out of court again after he began speaking straight to jurors during Lancaster’s evidence. Shortly after, Shaw directly challenged the judge, asking: “Why are you not trying the people causing this crisis?” He too was dragged out. Lancaster was next, for refusing to leave the witness box, and that night, all three were remanded to prison. Gethin had to wait but was also arrested for contempt on both Monday and Tuesday.', 'By the end of the trial, Whittaker De Abreu, the only one who had not represented herself, was the only defendant left in court.', 'As a punishment for their “persistent disruption”, Hehir slashed the time given to each defendant from one hour to 20 minutes. He further prohibited any mention of the climate crisis, the legal defences he had disallowed or the principle of jury equity – the idea that jurors can acquit based on their conscience.', 'As Hallam, Shaw, Lancaster and Gethin gave their speeches from behind the reinforced glass screen of the dock, they each proceeded to flout Hehir’s prohibitions, arguing they had been denied a right to a fair trial.', 'Hallam told jurors: “It’s blindingly obvious to us here first that you have not been given all the evidence you need. You cannot be sure of our guilt if you are not sure that you have not been given the evidence … we have received no good reason why we are not allowed to tell you what is blindingly obvious, namely what I’m not allowed to speak about. If you are not allowed to hear the blindingly obvious then it’s not a fair trial is it?”', 'It took just a day’s deliberations for the jury to unanimously find them guilty.', 'Given the recent history of UK climate protest trials, in which defendants have been sentenced to jail for merely mentioning the words “climate change”, and notwithstanding the dramatic arrests in court, Forst said he was surprised the judge gave them an opportunity to mention climate breakdown at all.', '“But the little latitude they had to mention climate change was in the meantime emptied of its very meaning by the fact that, overall, the jury was told to ignore most of it,” he added.', 'Forst also said he was dismayed by the judge’s decision to refuse the defendants a chance to present more fully their evidence about climate breakdown. “That’s precisely one of the serious concerns I have about what is happening in some courts in the UK. Defendants should be allowed to explain why they have decided to use non-conventional but yet peaceful forms of action, like civil disobedience, when they engage in environmental protest,” he said.', 'It is not just in the UK that climate defenders are facing persecution, according to Forst, but the problems in this country are particularly acute. Protesters in countries such as France and Germany also faced political opposition – and in some cases, police brutality – but when it came to judicial persecution, the UK was unique, he said.', '“[Elsewhere] you see environmental activists who block roads or sporting events being sentenced to a fine, or even sometimes suspended prison sentences for instance,” Forst said. “However, while I don’t have a full picture of what’s happening in every country, the UK is a nightmare for climate activists from this point of view, in the sense that the sentences imposed in other countries are neither that harsh, nor that widespread.', '“Facing several years of imprisonment for taking part in a Zoom call – this is something I have not seen anywhere else and it is shockingly disproportionate.”', 'The nightmare is just beginning for Hallam, Shaw, Lancaster, Gethin and Whittaker De Abreu, who have all been remanded to prison before sentencing next Thursday.

The courts have been clear that leniency is conditional: “A\xa0sense of proportion on the part of the offenders in avoiding excessive damage or inconvenience is matched by a relatively benign approach to sentencing.” The judge argued that their conspiracy to cause extreme disruption, and the risk of harm including to the emergency services, excluded them from consideration for reduced culpability or lower sentencing. He also pointed to other aggravating factors including the fact all were on bail for other charges when they committed the offence. (All have previous convictions.)', 'Because he regarded their offence as more serious, the judge was consciously harsher than in a previous case of two protesters who closed the Dartford crossing for 40 hours]; their prison sentences were discounted by 25% (to three years and two years seven months) because of their motive (which the court of appeal described as “arguably generous”). Perhaps overly punitive, but it is hard to disagree that the right to protest is qualified. In this case, the protesters were by design setting out to cause their fellow citizens the maximum disruption possible. The\xa0police say Just Stop Oil has refused to work constructively with them in the context of offers to facilitate lawful protest. Treating them with excessive lenience would\xa0send a message that anyone who feels strongly about an issue – from Scottish independence to banning abortion – should feel free to shut down the motorway network to make their point. Moreover, Hallam has himself in the past implied getting jailed is an objective:\xa0“If you’re not in prison, you’re not in resistance.”', 'Sign up to Observed', ""Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers"", 'after newsletter promotion', 'Next is the question of whether the sentences were too harsh, setting aside motivations. As well as the impact and intended impact, the judge relied heavily on the need for deterrence; he described them all as having crossed the line from “concerned campaigner to fanatic”; they had “appointed [themselves] as the sole arbiters about what should be done about climate change, bound neither by democracy nor the rule of law”. He pointed to their behaviour at the trial, calculated to disrupt the proceedings as much as possible, as evidence of their reoffending risk.', 'Many have fairly questioned whether the prison sentences should have been so long in the context of the wider system; someone taking part in violent disorder that caused serious harm would be sentenced to two to four years under sentencing guidelines, for example. The judge said if their plans had had the intended impact, their sentences would have been closer to the maximum of 10 years, which would put them on a par with the most serious, large-scale fraud cases. Unlike for most other offences, there are no sentencing guidelines for causing public nuisance, a common law offence before it became statutory in 2022, so judges have little guidance; sentences have become tougher since 2022, but so has the scale of organised disruption by groups like\xa0Just Stop Oil.', 'So at the very least there needs to be a review of sentencing in this area to check its proportionality. I\xa0would go further: these protesters committed a serious offence that justifies punishment, but does this have to mean prison? Prison is an expensive, finite resource that should be reserved for criminals who pose a serious risk to the community that cannot be otherwise mitigated; our prisons are overfull to the point they cannot fulfil their rehabilitation role and so are putting society at greater risk. Why not deprive non-violent offenders of their liberty through restrictive curfews monitored through electronic tagging instead?', 'But we should be clear that asking\xa0this question is quite distinct from the overwrought handwringing\xa0which posits that stopping people from self-indulgently crippling important national infrastructure is somehow an authoritarian abuse of democracy.', 'Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist', 'Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

When governments ban them. The oppressive laws introduced by the previous government – the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 and the Public Order Act 2023 – are a tick list of effective political engagement. Everything from locking on and digging tunnels to actions on roads, at airports, oil refineries or newspapers, even marching down a street, has been criminalised. Why? Because these methods work. If they didn’t, the government wouldn’t have bothered.', 'The Conservatives justified their draconian measures with the claim that they prevented “disruption to the public”. But had they cared about disruption, they would have done all they could to prevent climate breakdown. Nothing is more disruptive than the flickering and eventual collapse of Earth systems. If you believe a few people sitting in the street is a major impediment to traffic, take a look at what a sea surge, a flash flood, a windstorm or a rail-buckling, road-melting, bridge-jamming heat event can do to transport infrastructure.', 'The government and prosecutors made great play of the inconvenience caused by the closure of the Dartford Crossing when protesters climbed on to it in 2022. The court imposed massive and cruel penalties. But the crossing is frequently closed by high winds, a problem expected to become much worse as a result of the issue the protesters were seeking to highlight. No government minister appears before the cameras at such moments, thundering about the diversion of ambulances, commuters and parents on the school run, and demanding that the chief executives of oil companies are locked up.', 'Instead, the previous government went out of its way to exacerbate disruption, licensing new oil and gas drilling and an entirely pointless coalmine; blocking onshore wind power; subsidising at great expense people’s fossil fuel bills, rather than spending a fraction of that money to help us insulate and improve our homes.', 'As we approach the Earth systems horizon, governments and corporations have gone to ever more extreme lengths to prevent us from doing anything about it. The Tory government sought to bypass the House of Commons to insert extra measures into the first oppressive bill. When that failed, it inserted them into the second bill. It then used “Henry VIII powers” to extend the measures without proper parliamentary scrutiny. Corporations and public bodies have slapped injunctions on hundreds of people to prevent them from protesting, in some cases forcing them to pay huge amounts of money for the privilege. This outrageous system of private fines for thoughtcrimes has not received nearly enough coverage. Far from preventing such abuses, the previous government reinforced them with new injunction powers of its own: you can now be punished twice for the same political crime.', 'But perhaps the most pernicious innovation was to shut down crucial legal defences. One attorney general removed the defence of proportionality; another removed the defence of lawful excuse. This means that environmental activists can no longer explain their motives to a jury. They have to be tried as though they were mindless vandals, inconveniencing people for kicks, rather than seeking to prevent, at great cost to themselves, the greatest crisis humankind has ever faced. Some protesters have sought to explain themselves regardless, and have as a result been imprisoned for contempt of court.', 'On Thursday five Just Stop Oil activists were sentenced to record prison terms for peaceful protest in the UK. Four of them received four years and one received five years for “conspiracy to cause a public nuisance”: they had been involved in planning to close the M25. These are sentences of the kind you might expect in Russia or Egypt. Before they were handed down, the UN’s special rapporteur Michel Forst pointed out that the terms of the prosecution, in one defendant’s case merely for appearing on a Zoom call, were “shockingly disproportionate”.', 'Four of the defendants were rearrested in court for continuing to explain their motives after the judge had instructed them to stop. He told the jury that the issue of climate breakdown was “entirely irrelevant to the question of whether or not each is guilty or not guilty”. Let’s pretend our existential predicament had no bearing on their actions.', 'Outside the court, 11 more people were arrested for holding signs stating that jurors have a right to exercise their conscience, an ancient principle in English law. Earlier this year, the Tory solicitor-general, a government minister, applied to have another activist, Trudi Warner, prosecuted for holding such a sign. But the application was dismissed on the grounds that she had committed no crime.', 'The new government now seeks to address one grim Tory legacy, our bursting prisons, by releasing prisoners – including violent offenders – early. At the same time it fails to address or even mention another and even worse inheritance: the jailing of entirely peaceful people seeking to prevent existential disaster. Perhaps the prisons can be emptied of violent criminals so they can be refilled with environmentalists.', 'And yet the Labour party committed, before the election, to Just Stop Oil’s core demand: an end to new gas and oil exploitation. There was once a solid political consensus around “maximising economic recovery” of the UK’s oil and gas. I believe Just Stop Oil played a crucial role in changing this.', 'Before the election, Ed Miliband, now the secretary of state for energy security and net zero, recited the usual mantras: Just Stop Oil’s tactics were “alienating people” and not helping its cause. But were it not for the alienating protest movements of the past 20 years, I doubt his job would exist.', 'Labour once recognised that protest is the wellspring of democracy, from which has flowed all our fundamental rights: the right of women to own their lives and make their own decisions, the right to vote, to choose any religion or none, to express our sexuality as we please, to speak freely, to fair wages and working conditions, even to weekends.', 'Effective protest is an ecosystem. It needs a moderate flank and a radical flank. It needs a wide range of skillsets and degrees of commitment.

Here the Guardian explains the basis of the restrictions and why they are so contentious.', 'The judge, Christopher Hehir, placed limits on evidence the defendants could bring on the impacts of climate breakdown, and why such evidence justified the types of acts of which they were accused. His ruling has similarities to that made by Judge Silas Reid in a series of climate protest cases heard at inner London crown court last year in which Reid said climate change could not be mentioned, although in the M25 case Hehir said the defendants could speak about their political or philosophical beliefs on the issue, to give some context to their actions.', 'Judges restrict both sides in court to evidence deemed relevant to the case. In many criminal cases, what is relevant is uncontroversial, but in protest cases it has become a source of fierce debate. Judges have some discretion in deciding what is relevant and look to the existing law. In recent years the defences available to protesters in criminal cases have been reduced, leading some judges to not only disallow those defences but also limit mention of the defendants’ motivations.', 'While no judge will allow anyone giving evidence carte blanche in terms of what they can say and how long they can say it for – which would be a recipe for anarchy – Reid took the most extreme approach. Other judges have adopted more of a compromise, by, for example, restricting the amount of time a defendant can spend talking about their motivation.', 'Climate protesters believe that by preventing them explaining their motivations in full – namely, the existential threat to the planet – judges are preventing jurors from being given the full picture and from making an informed decision on whether to convict or acquit. The campaign group Defend Our Juries says: “Judges in UK courtrooms are denying both defendants and jurors their rights by restricting what defendants can say in their trials and by limiting what jurors are allowed to hear.”', 'Climate protesters have previously been jailed for contempt of court for mentioning the climate crisis as motivation for their actions when expressly forbidden to do so by the judge. At least three of the defendants in the M25 case have been arrested on suspicion of contempt of court.', 'Contempt of court, which has existed since at least the 13th century in England, is intended to protect the right to a fair trial and prevent a case being unfairly influenced. While climate protesters explaining their motivations may feel they are tipping the scales in favour of a fair trial, how a fair trial is achieved and what defences and evidence are relevant and admissible is ultimately for the judge to decide. Disobeying their ruling risks contempt, even if it is inarguable scientific evidence on the climate crisis.', 'Eleven people were arrested for holding placards with messages including “Jurors deserve to hear the whole truth” – an apparent reference to the restrictions placed on defendants – and “Jurors have an absolute right to acquit a defendant according to their conscience”.

The protesters were bailed on condition they did not come within the vicinity of Southwark crown court until a contempt proceedings hearing on 27 September.', 'The law on contempt of court seeks to ensure that jurors decide cases solely on the evidence presented at trial, as controlled by the judge, and to that end nothing on the merits of either side’s case beyond what is heard in court must be published or communicated to them. Members of the jury must be free to carry out their duties without interference or outside influence.', 'The arrest of the 11 people outside the M25 trial follows that of Trudi Warner, who, in March last year, on the first day of a trial of members of Insulate Britain, stood outside inner London crown court holding a placard that read: “Jurors, you have an absolute right to acquit a defendant according to your conscience.” This is a principle enshrined on a plaque in the Old Bailey, but which counsel cannot invite a jury to apply nor inform them of.', 'The solicitor general attempted to bring contempt proceedings against Warner, but Mr Justice Saini refused, sitting at the high court, and dismissed the claim, accusing government lawyers of “mischaracterising” the evidence when they said Warner had acted in an intimidating and abusive manner.

You’ve got to see it through.’ It’s like Olympic training. You go through tough times and being in that cell, and out in the media, is the other half of my work. Thousands of people undertake non-violent direct action and are arrested. These forms of protest are a desperate form of communication to shine a light on the issues, so explaining what and why we’re doing it is important. But\xa0it’s frightening because sometimes you’re dealing with hostile people. I don’t seek out hostility. I find it challenging, as is being in a prison cell.”', 'Stott, who became an Olympic champion when he and Tim Baillie won the C2 canoe slalom 12 years ago, is an impressively calm yet resolute advocate for non-violent direct action to save the planet. He has been arrested 10 times but has not received any kind of custodial sentence, rather some small fines, for his activism.', 'We talk before, during and after he spends much of the day at the Restore Nature Now march, which drew about 80,000 people to central London in late June. Rather than being provocative, Stott is friendly and thoughtful while offering illuminating insights into the way the “dark energy” of elite sport bolsters his resilience. When I ask him about the state of our burning and flooded world, Stott resorts to a\xa0simple football analogy.', '“We’re 10-0 down with five minutes to go,” Stott says. “We’ve got no time left. Positive changes are happening but everything we do now can only minimise the harm. That is really worth fighting for. The harder question is: ‘Am I going to pretend this isn’t happening? Am I going to turn away?’”', 'Stott is on a roll. “To embark on any epic mission, you have to have some naivety because if you knew how hard and brutal it was going to be, you’d never start. But then, if you knew how amazing it would also end up being, you’d be off like a shot. This is the power of sport and what we are doing now. We set ourselves these beautiful visions and that gives you the energy to\xa0start.', '“I see many parallels between sport and the struggles that we’re facing now. The proportion of victory in activism and sport is similar. You don’t win very often but you take satisfaction in a job well done and satisfaction from the small wins. You don’t get the chance to race in, and win, a big race every\xa0day.”', 'Stott is one of those rare people who knows what it is like to win an Olympic gold medal. Yet his path to glory was pitted with doubt. He and Baillie were not selected for the 2008 Olympics and he remembers: “We were good enough technically and physically to win a medal at world level but psychologically we crumbled. Competing was too stressful. We had to face the painful reality we needed to go to those darker places we had avoided.”', 'Their confident rivals, David Florence and Richard Hounslow, were a more typical alpha-male pairing expected to be the best British canoeing hope at London 2012. “They came along just after our 2008 failure,” Stott says. “We realised we had to work on our mental toughness and competing against them exposed us to adversity. It’s uncomfortable because you spend a lot of time getting beaten. They had different values and methods but we shared the same coach – and every day was a challenge.”', 'Stott laughs. “I went bald because of those guys.”', 'They also faced the Hochschorner twins, Pavol and Peter, the Slovakian pair who were favoured to win their fourth consecutive Olympic title. “They were the best and everyone thought they’d win,” Stott says. “They were our heroes but we focused on doing our best while being at peace with the idea that we would accept it if we weren’t good enough. That was liberating.”', 'As the slowest qualifiers, Baillie and Stott were the first to race against the clock in the final. “We weren’t the best on paper but our mindset was strong,” Stott says. “When we crossed the line our coach was jumping up and down and he\xa0said: ‘You’re two and a half seconds faster than the semi‑final\xa0leaders.’”', 'By the time those quickest qualifiers, Florence and Hounslow, were set to race, Stott and Baillie were guaranteed silver. That soon turned into gold and Stott smiles: “I remember standing on the podium, a really hot sun on the side of my face, hearing the national anthem. My hairs are standing up now talking about it because we had worked super‑hard and gone\xa0through all the ups and\xa0downs.\xa0It was rare beyond words to be at your peak and win your home Olympics. But I also felt that time was preparation for\xa0whatever came next.”', 'Baillie retired and Stott and his new crewmate, Mark Proctor, missed qualifying for the 2016 Rio Olympics. Stott became a vegetarian the next day and, having been on his first march in 2008, he soon turned to activism. “Towards the end I’d found it more and more difficult,” he says of his sporting career. “We’d raced in Rio, with the canoe course in the middle of the favela, and the heat was extreme. I felt my body melting inside. It was really horrible. We’d trained in Dubai where there is a facade of freedom but it’s very restricted and repressed. Training on a river in the middle of the desert made it stranger and more difficult.”', 'Stott and his friend Dave Hampton, a former GB rower, started their Champions For Earth movement, which brings sport and environmental concerns together. “That was in 2017,” Stott recalls, “and in late 2018 Extinction Rebellion burst into my world. It offered a formula to reference the science on the one hand, and history and social change on the other. So I was like: ‘This sounds sensible and I should be involved as a minor public figure.’ Any power I have is not for selling Rice Krispies. It’s to do something good for people.', '“Extinction Rebellion has always referenced Gandhi, Martin Luther King and other non-violent protests. I’m not a violent person but I like the way that sport channels the dark energy within us all in a positive way. Huge strides are being made because of Extinction Rebellion, Greta Thunberg and the non-violent methods we have used. Just Stop Oil are now charging ahead but it’s incredibly difficult. It took a lot of bravery for me to do what I did but it’s the least I can do when I see this\xa0challenge.”', 'Sign up to The Recap', 'The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action', 'after newsletter promotion', 'Stott recalls the series of protests Extinction Rebellion staged in 2019 to cause disruption as a way of highlighting the need to tackle the climate and nature emergency. “The first step was the Five Bridges action, which was to test their method of closing London down. I was arrested for the first time. But it was April 2019 when we had our big popping moment and that’s when I first ‘went public’ and got arrested as an Olympic champion.”', 'Apart from lying in the road to stop traffic, Stott and his partner, Laura Baldwin, a former Olympic sailor, were among a group of XR activists that blockaded Fawley refinery in Hampshire. Stott also glued himself to another protester on top of a Shell oil tanker in Bayswater Road, near Hyde Park, in April 2022. He and four others were cleared of any wrongdoing in court.', 'While Stott argues that some judges have a vendetta against environmental activists he has, mostly, received fair treatment from the police and the courts. “I’ve only been treated roughly by the police on one occasion and that was during a protest against Amazon, a horrendous company,” he says.', '“I was acting as a liaison between the protesters and the police to make it a more controlled environment because nobody likes it when panic or agitation bubbles over. Normally the police don’t arrest the protest liaison. But in this case they grabbed me by the neck and dragged me to the van. A few hours later, in the queue into the custody suite to get booked in, I spoke to the policeman who did it. He said: ‘I feel really bad as you’re a nice guy and I wish I wasn’t having to do this.’ I was like: ‘I wish you didn’t either because we could have carried on peacefully.’”', 'Stott acknowledges that changes to the law have made protest much riskier. “Now, sitting in the road, or wilful obstruction of the highway – which I was convicted of once – means you can be sent to prison for a year,” he says.', 'How does this make him feel? Stott, now 45, pauses. “It’s worrying. I have a partner and Laura has a young son and I’m involved in family life. But, if necessary, I am prepared to go to prison. This is a sensible and responsible struggle in a great emergency. With\xa0that\xa0athlete’s mindset, if prison is required, then maybe it\xa0has\xa0to\xa0be\xa0me.”', 'Stott has little hope that sufficient action will be taken, in regard to environmental issues, under the new Labour government. He also warns: “In the future, young people may feel non-violent action is not enough. They may become violent in their frustration that so little is being done. Their anger may bubble\xa0over.”', 'We catch the tube from Waterloo to Green Park and Stott reiterates that he will never fly again – even though Baillie, his close friend, and\xa0three children live in Canada. They remain in touch and Stott thinks a lot of the Baillie kids, and Laura’s son, whenever he is locked up in a\xa0cell.', 'Before the Restore Nature Now march Stott is embraced and high-fived by friends and colleagues. He soon begins his role as an amiable and efficient MC and reminds everyone that 400 organisations are represented and the march will be peaceful. As Stott tells me a week later: “It was a great success. We had many first-time marchers and it was one of the most media-covered marches ever. But I don’t know how many people believe they put any pressure on the government to change its approach. I would still argue that non-violent direct action is an effective way of pushing something invisible into the light.”', 'As for our uncertain future, Stott says: “I don’t know whether we’re going to win. But I do my best. The most powerful thing I took from my sporting career is belief in human potential and, to me, it’s a force. Nobody knows what a human being\xa0is capable of until that moment they become truly committed. Amazing things can happen then. I choose to believe that a great turning, and a great collective change, is\xa0still\xa0possible.”']",['Donald McRae'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7d2b084412f8e30c93578d3b0726fa65ed311fb/349_500_7857_4714/master/7857.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', ""Etienne Stott with a 'Champions For Earth' flag""], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e44d42efa697ec449d070ab1c4f8041c858c196/547_947_7592_4555/master/7592.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Etienne Stott addresses the Restore Nature Now march in June 2024'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75fbe203bc378ecf23a1a8c4f0ee374a518010e3/0_27_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Etienne Stott with Tim Baillie compete on their way to Olympic gold at London 2012'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b407443c57cf6e759fbd24b1d9bdf0c438a9f165/61_0_1798_1080/master/1798.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Screengrab from a video of Olympic gold medallist Etienne Stott being arrested by police at the Extinction Rebellion demonstration on Waterloo Bridge']]",

We need a better plan', 'The Labour party has a plan for returning to power: it will get BlackRock to rebuild Britain. Its reasoning is straightforward. A cash-strapped government that wants to avoid tax increases or austerity has no choice but to partner with big finance, attracting private investment to rebuild the infrastructure that is crumbling after years of Tory underinvestment. Labour has already done the arithmetic: to mobilise £3 of private capital from institutional investors, you need to offer them £1 in public subsidies. But every time you hear Labour announce such an infrastructure partnership, think of the hidden politics. BlackRock will privatise Britain – our housing, education, health, nature and green energy – with our taxpayer money as sweetener.', 'BlackRock has long peddled the idea of public-private partnerships for infrastructure, climate and development. Yet its political momentum has recently accelerated. When its chair, Larry Fink, the world’s most powerful financier, sat with world leaders at the G7 summit last month, he promised the following: rich countries need growth, infrastructure investment can deliver that growth, but public debt is too high for the state alone to invest the estimated $75tn (£59tn) necessary by 2040. Trillions, however, are available to asset managers who look after our pensions and insurance contributions (BlackRock, the largest of these firms, manages about $10tn, as a shrinking welfare state pushes us – future pensioners – into its arms).', 'If governments work with big finance, Fink explained, they can unlock these trillions. But to do so, they will need to mint public infrastructure into investable assets that can generate steady returns for investors. Why does BlackRock need the state? Why can’t it deploy trillions without the government’s helping hand? The British public remembers all too well PFIs, the private finance initiatives through which the state ended up paying extortionate amounts to private contractors that designed, built, financed or operated public services such as prisons, schools and hospitals before handing them back to the state, often in poor condition.', 'But for big finance, there is more now at stake. In this golden age of infrastructure, financiers plan to own our infrastructure outright and transform it into a source of steady revenue. Since buying Global Infrastructure Partners in January 2024, BlackRock holds about $150bn in infrastructure assets, including US renewable energy companies, wastewater services in France and airports in England and Australia. It plans to expand aggressively, just like other private infrastructure funds. Direct ownership is the main game, but not the only one. Big finance can also invest in infrastructure indirectly, by lending to private infrastructure companies. The key is returns. For this, BlackRock wants the state to “derisk” investments. This financial jargon was included in the 2024 Labour manifesto, and it in essence involves the state stepping in to improve the returns on infrastructure assets.', 'The choice here is not merely between public and private financing of public goods, but whether British citizens should tolerate the government handing out public subsidies for privatised infrastructure. Housing is only one example of the areas where these investors can already be glimpsed. Institutional landlords – the most prominent being Blackstone, a private equity fund that is one of the world’s biggest corporate residential landlords – can acquire residential housing by participating in the privatisation of public housing. After the global financial crisis, the firm also bought up nonperforming mortgages, and since then it has gone on a global shopping spree, snapping up homes across the US and Europe. In the past year, Blackstone bought new rental homes in Britain worth about £1.4bn from the housebuilding company Vistry.', 'Look behind Blackstone’s returns – which come from rents and rising house prices – and you will find the state’s footprint. The government has helped to guarantee and derisk these returns through regulations that favour asset owners over renters, through economic policies that support house price inflation and through the provision of income support – such as housing benefit – that allows renters to continue paying their institutional landlords. Although we’re told that partnering with these investors is a means of solving the housing crisis, it often delivers the opposite: higher rents, the displacement of lower-income tenants who are often from minority groups, and less affordable housing. This explains the backlash against institutional landlords, from Copenhagen to Berlin, Dublin and Madrid. Yet such public pressure will only be effective once the state returns to building public housing.', 'Labour’s strategy raises a bigger set of questions about the type of state we want. Starmer’s vision for government-by-BlackRock reduces the question of state capacity to “how do I get BlackRock to invest in infrastructure assets?” This model involves the state in effect subsidising the privatisation of everyday life. This doesn’t only make it harder to bring public goods back into public ownership; it also allows big finance to tighten the grip on the social contract with citizens, and to become the ultimate arbiter of climate, energy and welfare politics, which will have profound distributional, structural and political consequences.', 'Already, BlackRock is betting on becoming a key provider of green energy infrastructure – though its actual commitment to tackling the climate crisis only extends so far. The firm has lobbied heavily against European proposals to regulate its lending to fossil fuel interests with penalties, and has instead called for voluntary climate commitments. It is aiming to rapidly grow its green energy profits by tapping the government subsidies that will probably be provided through Starmer’s GB Energy, and through the US Inflation Reduction Act.', 'But the profits BlackRock will hope to generate through investing in green energy are likely to come at a huge cost. In Britain, we know that the public ownership of green energy is more effective at lowering consumer bills, accelerating the green transition and creating good jobs. The risk is not only that our climate future will be vastly more expensive if actors such as BlackRock are driving it, but that this future will also produce a more unequal society, where citizens equate green measures with unaffordable public services. This may well provide the kindling for authoritarian, far-right fossil-fuel politics that reject the green transition and frame it as an assault on people’s living standards.', 'Instead, we should plan creatively for a future where extreme climate events necessitate permanent state intervention, from price controls to buffer stocks and public ownership. What’s needed is a big green state. For this, we first need to repair a serious failure of macroeconomic policy imagination that regards the public purse as too small to fund transformative public infrastructure. To do so will require a radical transformation of the state. The state that Rachel Reeves, the likely future chancellor, promises us must break down the neoliberal walls between monetary, fiscal and industrial policy, and scrap low-tax regimes for multinational corporations and individuals with high net worths. It must shrink the power of big finance. This would be a gigantic undertaking, but it is the only realistic one we have.', 'Daniela Gabor is professor of economics and macrofinance at UWE Bristol', 'Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But now they are looking into an abyss.', '“Most of my friends went into the North Sea industry because for them, and for their fathers and their grandfathers, it has always been seen as a sure thing. Does the green economy offer that same security, the same pay?” Douglas says.', 'This is a crucial moment for these communities, according to Joe Rollin, a senior organiser at the union Unite, which represents tens of thousands of oil and gas workers. “We simply can’t let these workers be the coalminers of this generation, with all the devastation to lives and communities that would entail,” he says.', 'This is the challenge facing politicians in Westminster and Holyrood before this week’s general election. How do they manage the inevitable and urgent decline of North Sea oil and gas – and can they ensure a just transition to new low-carbon jobs that are fully unionised, well-paid and secure?', 'For Mika Minio-Paluello, a policy officer at the Trades Union Congress (TUC), there is a lot on the line.', '“Whatever happens to the people working in North Sea oil and gas, it is being closely watched by those in different industries and sectors – not just across the UK but also in other countries – to see if we can take working people on this journey.', '“It is a test case in some ways, for the whole idea of a just transition, of what happens when we decarbonise … we simply can’t have a repeat of what happened to coal workers in the 80s.”', 'The spectre of the miners’ plight after the pit closures in the 1980s hangs over this debate. The communities that were decimated when the then Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher closed the pits and smashed the coalminers’ union never recovered.', 'Arguably the stakes now are even higher. The escalating climate crisis demands a rapid end to fossil fuel production, but the populist right across Europe is on the rise and it has climate action in their sights – describing it as a remote, elite project being done at the expense of ordinary workers.', 'The UK’s main political parties are divided on the issue. The Conservative party is still promising to “max out” oil and gas in the North Sea by granting licences for new exploration every year. Meanwhile, Labour has promised to put an end to new licences, and raise taxes on the large profits being made by companies operating in the North Sea. The party is also promising “not a single job” will be lost during the transition.', 'In response, the Scottish National party has U-turned on its pledge to phase out fossil fuel licences and is trying to tread a “middle ground”, saying it will approve licences if they meet strict climate conditions – although most experts struggle to see how this could be possible.', 'Nigel Farage, the leader of the insurgent populist Reform UK party, is waiting to capitalise, vowing at his manifesto launch last month to axe net zero policies and fast-track licences to open up the North Sea.', '“If we fail to do this transition in a way that takes communities with us, then we leave the way open for Farage and the far right,” said Minio-Paluello. “The risk of the far right culture wars building a wave of support on the back of our failure is very, very real.”', 'There is little doubt the writing is on the wall for the industry. Experts point out that the number of jobs supported directly and indirectly by oil and gas has more than halved in the past decade – from 441,000 to 214,00 – during which time the government has issued roughly 400 new licences in six licensing rounds.', 'According to the former head of the oil and gas regulator, new licences would make a difference to gas production only “around the edges”.

According to a report by the consultancy EY, which was commissioned by the Scottish government, North Sea workers have an annual average salary of £88,000, while those working in the oil and gas supply chain earn an average of £51,000 a year.

First, the General Medical Council has disgraced itself by its judgment to suspend the GP, Sarah Benn, after she took part in a perfectly peaceful Just Stop Oil protest; so the GMC is the last institution to be supervising anybody. Second, PAs are the Tory administration’s attempt to provide medical care on the cheap; but of course in medicine, as in other walks of life,cutting standards and corners is never cheap. As there won’t be enough consultants to supervise the influx of PAs, the legal profession will be rubbing its hands in glee.', 'A better solution is to get rid of GPs entirely; get nurse practitioners to run what used to be GP surgeries; and promote GPs to the role of “physician associates” so that the entire workforce can start practising proper medicine again within the secondary referral setting.Dr Robin Russell-Jones\n Marlow, Buckinghamshire', 'It’s surprising how Simon Tisdall can talk about the need for constitutional reform (to solve America’s “Trump” problem) without discussing neoliberal economic reform (“America’s big problem is not Biden, it’s the menace to democracy posed by Trump”).', 'The\xa0radical Tea Party was formed as\xa0a response to the 1989 US/Canada Free Trade Agreement, which, within a decade of its unpopular imposition, threw millions of middle-class Americans and Canadians in the heartland out\xa0of work.', 'It is the same neoliberal economic policy at work in Britain, France, Italy, Spain and Germany. Most of these nations are also lurching to the right, as more and more people become frustrated with their impoverished economic realities.

The racing public still adored him and thousands turned up to see him run without having backed him. From the undefeated Eclipse in the 18th century (“Eclipse first, the rest nowhere”) to Nijinsky, Brigadier Gerard, Dancing Brave, Red Rum, Arkle and Desert Orchid, people do love brilliant racehorses. Last year, I forked out £90 (plus travel expenses) to see Frankel at his Newmarket stud. It was worth every\xa0penny to be in the presence of a superstar. I am a football fan but I wouldn’t pay £90 to meet any retired – or current – players, no matter how famous.Jim Hatley\n Brighton', 'While Will Hutton is quite right that there is capital available in existing pension funds to aid growth, there is another source staring us in the face (“Labour needs billions to fund its plans – and I know where it can be found”).

What does it mean for the race?', 'Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition', 'We’re resending today’s newsletter because some subscribers received it with the wrong subject line. Apologies for the error.', 'Good morning. Last night, the Republican national convention came to a fervent climax: after days of accolades from Donald Trump’s supporters in the aftermath of the attempt on his life at the weekend, the headline act finally stepped forward to give them his blessing. Accepting the party’s nomination, Trump spoke for more than an hour and a half – and while he began on a note of unity with heavily religious overtones, he soon turned to the more divisive rhetoric that has been familiar for years.', 'If claims of a more statesmanlike approach from Trump were overrated, the adoring reception from delegates was also an indication of how pumped up Republicans are – and what a formidable task faces Joe Biden, or his possible Democratic replacement. Today’s newsletter, with the Guardian’s David Smith in Milwaukee, runs you through the speech and the convention, and what it all means in the race for the presidency. Here are the headlines.', 'Protest | Five Just Stop Oil activists who planned to block the M25 have been sentenced to lengthy jail terms by a judge who told them they had “crossed the line from concerned campaigner to fanatic”. Supporters of the defendants expressed outrage at the four and five-year sentences, the longest ever given in the UK for non-violent protest.', 'Covid-19 | The UK’s pandemic planning was beset by “fatal strategic flaws”, a damning first report from the UK Covid-19 public inquiry has found, putting pressure on the prime minister to overhaul the national civil emergencies system. Former health secretaries Jeremy Hunt and Matt Hancock were criticised for their failure to better prepare the UK.', 'Prisons | About 5,500 offenders will be released early from prison to “avert disaster”, the justice secretary has said. It is the first time the government has provided a figure for the number of prisoners who will be released in England and Wales as part of emergency measures.', 'Leeds | A police car was flipped on its side and a bus set alight after unrest broke out in Leeds on Thursday evening. Amid claims that the disorder was linked to children being taken into care, police said the disorder was “instigated by a criminal minority intent on disrupting community relations”.', 'Europe | Ursula von der Leyen has been voted in for a second term as European Commission president, winning an emphatic victory as mainstream groups in the European parliament united to deny a win for anti-EU and extreme right forces.', 'On Sunday, after the shocking attempt on his life at a campaign rally, Trump said that he had completely rewritten his speech – which, naturally, left some real gold on the cutting-room floor. “The speech I was going to give on Thursday was going to be a humdinger,” Trump told the Washington Examiner. “Honestly, it’s going to be a whole different speech now.”', 'That’s how it started. “I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America,” he said, in the kind of boilerplate unity language that might be deployed by any political candidate on either side. “To every citizen, whether you are young or old, man or woman, Democrat, Republican or independent, Black or white, Asian or Hispanic, I extend to you a hand of loyalty and friendship.” As he described the assassination attempt against him, a rapt audience listened in pin-drop silence, with many in the crowd in tears.', 'But before long, Trump switched gears, delivering something more like his standard stump speech: complaining about “witch hunts”, making false claims (you can see a fact-check here), and veering into rambling asides.', '“There were reasons to be sceptical of the new Trump who pivots to be unifying, and it did not last long,” David Smith said. “At first it felt written to go against his image. But then it turned into something like a typical rally speech, and we were back to Trump 1.0.”', 'What did Trump say?', 'Trump has cannily refrained from talking in detail about the attempt on his life until now, a decision likely intended to drive attention to at least the first part of his speech. The uniform of Corey Comperatore, the volunteer firefighter who was killed by the gunman on Saturday, was placed on stage, and Trump kissed the helmet before leading the crowd in a moment of silence. He suggested that divine intervention has saved him, describing the attack as a “providential experience” and saying: “In a certain way, I felt very safe, because I had God on my side.”', '“All that came across very powerfully,” David said. “I was down on the convention floor during that section, and his audience were lapping it up. The cult of personality is now on steroids.”', 'Before long, though, he was making wild claims about the success of his presidency and saying that migrants were responsible for “the greatest invasion in our history” and coming “from mental institutions and insane asylums”. He attacked the media and “crazy Nancy Pelosi”, praised Hungary’s nationalist, pro-Russia prime minister Viktor Orbán, made false claims about the 2020 election, and claimed crime rates are rocketing when in fact they are going down.', 'How did it go down?', 'Trump spoke for more than twice as long as intended, and some audience members began to file out from the upper tier of the auditorium before he came to an end. Nonetheless, the reception among Republicans was – unsurprisingly – deliriously positive.', 'When he talked about how close he came to death on Saturday, they listened attentively, laughed when he remarked that he had learned that ears “bleed more than any other part of the body, for whatever reason,” and, when he said “I’m not supposed to be here tonight,” chanted in response: “Yes you are!”', 'It had been a peculiar evening all in all, with former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan ripping off his shirt (above), MAGA’s resident rock-rap act Kid Rock leading the crowd in a chorus of “fight” to the apparent bemusement of Melania Trump, and a glancing reference from Trump to “the late great Hannibal Lecter”.', 'Amid the adulation, one Texas delegate, Mark Boldger, told the Guardian that Trump “might’ve put a few people to sleep tonight” and failed to “worked the crowd into the fever he normally does”. But more important than the crowd’s response is how it will be viewed by voters who probably haven’t watched the whole thing.', '“It started pretty late and it went on a long time,” David said. “A lot of people will have only watched the first bit, which was the call for unity. And they have a decent shot of the coverage leading on the story of the shooting, so it may be that news broadcasts will paint him in a fairly favourable light – and they can bury the 85% which was nonsense.”', 'How has the convention gone overall?', '“It has been a pretty disciplined convention, with the most extreme voices relatively marginalised,” David said. “The impression has been – we’re well ahead, let’s not do anything stupid to give the Democrats an opportunity.”', 'Scratch the surface, and there is plenty of the more familiar rhetoric on show despite the “unity” promise. As rightwing activist Laura Loomer told the New York Times: “I don’t want to be nice to demons.” But that tendency is now accompanied by an even more fervent, and even religious, devotion to the party’s standard-bearer. “They see something divine in him, which feels very dangerous,” David said. “Providence and the idea of God’s protective shield around Trump has been a theme all week.”', 'Ray Myers, a Texas delegate, told Reuters: “There’s some kind of mystical thing going on. After everything he’s been through, everything that’s been thrown at him, and now he’s even shed his own blood. And he’s still here. I don’t know how else you can explain it, but God is involved.”', 'Meanwhile, with the selection of JD Vance as his running mate, Trump has also emphasised his now total control over the party that was once bitterly divided over his rise. Vance, a populist who opposed Trump as “America’s Hitler” but is now among his most fervent supporters, made a speech that appeared to deliberately emphasise the defeat of old-fashioned business-oriented Republicans in favour of Trump’s brand of populism: “We’re done, ladies and gentlemen, catering to Wall Street,” he said. “We’ll commit to the working man.”', 'Where does all this leave Joe Biden?', 'Nowhere good. Biden, who has contracted Covid-19 and been forced to self-isolate in Delaware at a crucial moment for his candidacy, might have hoped that the focus on Trump since the Pennsylvania shooting would derail attempts to force him to stand down – but after a brief hiatus, they have now intensified once more.', 'The Senate leader, Chuck Schumer, and the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, have both privately told Biden in the last week that there are serious concerns about whether he can beat Biden – and warned that if nothing changes they could go public with their concerns, the New York Times reported.', 'A prominent House Democrat, Adam Schiff, has said openly that it is time for Biden to “pass the torch”. Now the Washington Post reports that Barack Obama has told allies that Biden must seriously consider whether his candidacy is still viable. Meanwhile, the Times reported that people close to Biden say they believe he has “begun to accept the idea that he may not be able to win in November and may have to drop out of the race”.', 'After the debate that was such a disaster for Biden, Trump appeared to deliberately refrain from hammering his opponent. In his speech, Trump only mentioned Biden once, and wasn’t scripted to say his embattled opponent’s name at all. “That is notionally part of the ‘unity’ message,” David said. “But it’s tactical not to take him on too aggressively. His team are full of bravado about whoever they might face – but they clearly think that Biden gives them their strongest chance of victory.”', 'Sign up to First Edition', 'Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters', 'after newsletter promotion', 'For the 25th anniversary of Destiny’s Child’s second studio album, The Writing’s on the Wall, Alexis Petridis has ranked their 25 best songs.

https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/jul/10/history-for-tomorrow-by-roman-krznaric-review-looking-back-moving-forward,"['From Arab scholars to hippy mothers, can history offer forgotten answers to modern problems?', 'We need lessons from history now more than ever. Mothers with young children sit isolated in their own homes, oblivious to 1970s experiments in communal child-rearing. Broadcasters justify populist content on the grounds that it’s what “ordinary people” want, despite the rich 19th-century tradition of working-class intellectualism. The current Labour leadership’s adherence to strict “fiscal rules” disregards past successes of borrowing to invest and taxing the highest incomes at 90%. These histories allow us to see that contemporary evils such as austerity and inequality are contingent, not inevitable: it doesn’t have to be this way.', 'The mindfulness mantra to ‘live in the present’ distracts us from the real problem: we are not living enough in the past. The perpetual ‘now’ of online life erodes our collective memory. Historical novels and TV series are in demand, but often as vehicles for escapism. History for Tomorrow could not, therefore, be timelier or more welcome. Roman Krznaric’s books include The Good Ancestor: How to Think Long-term in a Short-term World, and this latest is similarly focused on addressing global heating, social division and runaway AI in order to build a better future; this time mining history for precedents and paradigms that might offer forgotten solutions.', 'We begin in Jamaica in 1831, when 20,000 slaves lost patience with the high-minded gradualism of white elites, setting fire to plantations and seizing control of land: a revolt which proved to be “a crucial tipping point” in the history of abolition. Krznaric makes a broader case for this “radical flank effect”, where activists instigate a political crisis that accelerates the pace of change: see also Black Power and Extinction Rebellion (though whether the latter will be decisive in averting climate disaster remains to be seen).', 'Populist politicians like to associate anti-immigration sentiment with tradition rather than racism (at least in public); calling for more tolerance looks like an attack on established communities. Krznaric cites the counter-tradition of multiculturalism in medieval Andalusia, where Jews, Muslims and Christians rubbed along pretty well (though some scholars regard this view as rose-tinted). The forced proximity of city life facilitates conviviality: a phenomenon known as “contact theory”.', 'As overconsumption depletes planetary resources, Krznaric holds up the Japanese city of Edo, now Tokyo, where, from the 17th century onwards, the ruling shoguns responded to scarcity by instituting a strictly regulated zero-waste “circular economy” (one of many buzzwords in this book). Almost everything was reused, repaired or recycled: “drippings of candle wax were remoulded, old metal pots were melted down, human hair was sold to wigmakers”. The challenge now is how to simulate scarcity in an age of apparent consumerist abundance.', 'While top-down measures like Edo’s can be effective, Krznaric prefers grassroots, decentralised self-government, such as the water tribunal (Tribunal de las Aguas) established by Islamic rulers in medieval Valencia and still operating today, with local farmers coming together to enforce the fair allocation of this precious resource. It’s a system that challenges the pervasive idea that, left to their own devices, people will grab more than their share: the so-called “tragedy of the commons”.', 'There are cautionary tales here too, such as the eugenics movement that haunts the development of commercial gene editing technology. Better to look to the development of the polio vaccine and its proto-crowdfunding initiative (the “March of Dimes”) that raised enough cash to fund the largest medical field trial in American history, led by the virologist Jonas Salk. After his discovery of the vaccine in 1955, Salk was interviewed on TV by Ed Murrow, who asked him who owned the patent. “Well, the people, I would say,” Salk replied. “Could you patent the sun?” There is a message here for the vast, privatised biotech industry.', 'With efforts to reduce wealth inequality seemingly stalled, what can history tell us about what works? The economic historian Walter Scheidel has argued that greater equality is usually brought about by violent disruptions of the social order, such as war or revolution. More optimistically, the economist Thomas Piketty believes it is social and political struggles that make institutional change possible, such as the introduction of progressive wealth taxes. Krznaric identifies another such route in early 20th-century Kerala in southern India, where communists organised pay strikes, set up a network of “fair price” shops and public libraries and supported women to start collective enterprises.', 'Against the dystopian ravages of platform capitalism – Google, Microsoft, Uber and the rest – Krznaric pits the cooperative tradition that has long flourished in Italy’s Emilia-Romagna region: the University of Bologna was run by its students for its first three centuries. Or we can remember the American farmers who formed electricity cooperatives during the Great Depression with help from government loans under the New Deal (the most successful models, perhaps, combine the bottom-up with the top-down).', 'One key to avoiding civilisational collapse was offered as early as 1375 by the Arab scholar Ibn Khaldun in his book The Muqaddimah, an attempt to account for how once great north African cities had fallen into ruin. In 1400, the Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur (or Tamerlane) laid siege to Damascus. Hearing that Khaldun had been taken captive, Timur had him lowered by rope in a basket over the city walls into his camp to tell him his insights. Khaldun explained that fallen empires lacked asabiya, “collective solidarity”. The contemporary researchers Luke Kemp and Peter Turchin agree, arguing that the concentration of wealth and political inequality are the biggest drivers of social disintegration.', 'Solidarity has in the past been strengthened by the presence of an external threat, and unfortunately climate change doesn’t really feel like that. Some hope lies in identifying enemies within (fossil fuel companies and billionaires). Or we can rekindle “biophilia”, love for the natural world, expressed in John Evelyn’s 1664 book Sylva, which kickstarted a tree-planting craze, and in the explosion of nature poetry, Linnean botany and recreational gardening in the 18th century.', 'Despite abundant portents, we still harbour a residual Enlightenment belief in automatic progress (one idea we should jettison), leading, Krznaric notes, to dangerous complacency and what ecologists call the shifting baseline – or “boiling frogs” – syndrome: a tendency to underestimate long-term decline. Tech corporations claim that their products have created unprecedented opportunities for social connection and the sharing of information, but cosmopolitan coffee houses were already serving that up in the 1700s.', 'History buffs may be distracted by their own counter-examples that complicate the “lessons learned”, but Krznaric readily admits to cherrypicking: his aim is to lay out a smörgåsbord of ideas to choose from. The problem for me is the selection is a bit thin. Too much space is devoted to establishing well-trodden arguments that are surely already accepted by the book’s probable readership (climate change bad, multiculturalism good, consumerism bad, equality good), and too many of the examples are easily Googleable staples of left-green thinking. I wanted this book to dig deeper into the historical record, engage more thoroughly with debates about what makes change happen, and work harder to demonstrate how these precedents can be stitched into the here and now. Krznaric is fighting the good fight: he needs all the ammunition he can get.', 'History for Tomorrow: Inspiration from the Past for the Future of Humanity by Roman Krznaric is published by WH Allen (£22).

The editor has previously declared that his Irish nationality and his blog being hosted in the US meant that “I don’t have to pay attention to what a British judge orders me to do”.', 'Vince said: “He believes his ‘offshore’ structure protects him from being accountable, that he can flout our laws and disregard basic principles … With this legal action we hope to change that.”', 'The green energy businessman has been given permission by an English judge to serve libel papers on Staines via email and post to his home in Ireland. Staines declined to comment.', 'Vince is also seeking a website blocking order, which means that a London-based court could order British internet service providers to block access to specific blogposts. The approach is more commonly used in copyright cases, such as the blocking of illegal Premier League football streams.', 'The case hinges on a Guido Fawkes post from March entitled “Multi-million pound donor to Labour party says Hamas are ‘freedom fighters’”.

That’s how it works.”', 'The businessman claims the clip was used to imply that he supported the terrorist acts of Hamas, including “the mass murder, kidnapping and rape which took place on 7 October”.', 'The Daily Mail and GB News have already apologised and paid damages to Vince over similar stories.', 'Vince said in a statement: “Some weeks ago, the Guido Fawkes website published false claims about me which spread quickly amongst rightwing channels and commentators, probably in part due to the imminent election. The intention was clear, to damage my credibility as a person and as a Labour supporter.', '“We’ve secured numerous retractions with costs and damages already, such as from the Daily Mail and GB News, and for me this is the most important piece of the puzzle, the source. I’m pleased we’ve now been given permission to take action against the editor, Paul Staines.”', 'The Guido Fawkes site has previously said it asked Vince “to put on the record unambiguously that he does not think Hamas are freedom fighters”, in which case they “will be happy to withdraw and/or amend our previous reports accordingly”.', 'It added: “They stated he had previously condemned terrorism on the record. We accept and never claimed otherwise that Mr Vince has previously condemned terrorism, including saying of the specific acts of Hamas terrorism on the weekend of October 7, 2023: ‘I don’t support what they did.’ We remain baffled therefore why he won’t even through his lawyers confirm that he does not think Hamas are, in the words he used, ‘freedom fighters’.”', 'Guido Fawkes has links to the Tory party, having recently appointed the Conservative peer Ross Kempsell as a contributing editor.

Why isn’t she better known today?', 'My used copy of the first edition of The Disinherited Family arrives in the post from a secondhand bookseller in Lancashire. A dark blue hardback inscribed with the name of its first owner, Miss M Marshall, and the year of publication, 1924, it cost just £12.99. I am not a collector of old tomes but am thrilled to have this one. It has a case to be considered among the most important feminist economics books ever written.', 'Its centenary has so far received little, if any, attention. Yet the arguments it sets out are the reason nearly all mothers in the UK receive child benefit from the government. Its author, Eleanor Rathbone, was one of the most influential women in politics in the first half of the 20th century. She led the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship (Nusec, the main suffragist organisation, also formerly known as the National Union of Women Suffrage Societies) from 1919, when Millicent Fawcett stood down, until the roughly five million women who were not enfranchised in 1918 gained the vote 10 years later. In 1929, aged 57, she became an MP, and remained in parliament until her death in 1946. While there, she built up a formidable reputation based on her advocacy for women’s rights, welfare reform and the rights of refugees, and her opposition to the appeasement of Hitler.', 'It would not be true to say that Eleanor Rathbone has been forgotten. Her portrait by James Gunn hangs in the National Portrait Gallery. Twenty years ago she was the subject of a fine biography and she is remembered at Somerville college, Oxford – where she studied in the 1890s and ran a society called the Associated Prigs. (While the name was a joke, Rathbone did have a priggish side – as well as being an original thinker, tremendous campaigner, and stubborn, sensitive personality.) She also features in Rachel Reeves’s book The Women Who Made Modern Economics, although Reeves – who hopes shortly to become the UK’s first female chancellor – pays more attention to her contemporary, Beatrice Webb.', 'But Rathbone, who came from a wealthy dynasty of nonconformist merchants, does not have anything like the name-recognition of the Pankhursts or Millicent Fawcett, or of pioneering politicians including Nancy Astor and Ellen Wilkinson. Nor does she enjoy the cachet of writers such as Virginia Woolf, whose polemic about women’s opportunities, A Room of One’s Own, was published five years after Rathbone’s magnum opus.', 'There are many reasons for Rathbone’s relative obscurity. One is that she was the first woman elected to parliament as an independent (and one of a handful of men at the time). Thus there is no political party with an interest in turning her into an icon. Having spent the past three years writing a book about the British women’s movement, I am embarrassed to admit that when I started, I didn’t know who she was.', 'Rathbone was not the first person to propose state benefits paid to mothers. The endowment of motherhood or family allowances, as the policy was known, was written about by the Swedish feminist Ellen Key, and tried out as a project of the Fabian Women’s Group, who published their findings in a pamphlet in 1912. But Rathbone pushed the idea to the forefront. A first attempt to get Nusec to adopt it was knocked back in 1921, and she then spent three years conducting research. The title she gave the book she produced, The Disinherited Family, reflected her view that women and children were being deprived of their rightful share of the country’s wealth.', 'The problem, as she saw it, was one of distribution. While the wage system in industrialised countries treated all workers on a given pay grade the same, some households needed more money than others. While unions argued for higher wages across the board, Rathbone believed the state should supplement the incomes of larger families. She opened the book with an archly phrased rhetorical question: “Whether there is any subject in the world of equal importance that has received so little consideration as the economic status of the family?” She went on to accuse economists of behaving as if they were “self-propagating bachelors” – so little did the lives of mothers appear to interest them.', 'Rathbone’s twin aims were to end wives’ dependence on husbands and reward their domestic labour. Family allowances paid directly to them could either be spent on housekeeping or childcare, enabling them to go out to work. Ellen Wilkinson, the radical Labour MP for Middlesbrough (and future minister for education), was among early supporters. William Beveridge read the book when he was director of the London School of Economics, declared himself a convert and introduced one of the first schemes of family-linked payments for his staff.', 'But others were strongly opposed. Conservative objections to such a radical expansion of the state were predictable. But they were echoed by liberal feminists including Millicent Fawcett, who called the plan “a step in the direction of practical socialism”. Trade unions preferred to push for a living wage, while some male MPs thought the policy undermined the role of men as breadwinners. Labour and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) finally swung behind family allowances in 1942. As the war drew to a close, Rathbone led a backbench rebellion against ministers who wanted to pay the benefit to fathers instead.', 'It is for this signature policy that she is most often remembered today. At a time when hundreds of thousands of children have been pushed into poverty by the two-child limit on benefit payments, Rathbone’s advocacy on behalf of larger families could hardly be more relevant. The limit, devised by George Osborne, applies to universal and child tax credits – and not child benefit itself. But Rishi Sunak’s government announced changes to the latter in this year’s budget. From 2026, eligibility will be assessed on a household rather than individual basis. This is intended to limit payments to better-off, dual-income families. But the UK Women’s Budget Group and others have objected on grounds that child benefit should retain its original purpose of directly remunerating primary carers (the vast majority of them mothers) for the work of rearing children. It remains to be seen whether this plan will be carried through by the next government.', 'Rathbone once told the House of Commons she was “100% feminist”, and few MPs have been as single-minded in their commitment to women’s causes. As president of Nusec (the law-abiding wing of the suffrage campaign), she played a vital role in finishing the job of winning votes for women.', 'The last few years have seen a resurgence of interest in women’s suffrage, partly due to the centenary of the first women’s suffrage act. Thanks to a brilliant campaign by Caroline Criado Perez, a statue of Millicent Fawcett, the nonmilitant suffragist leader, now stands in Westminster, a few minutes walk from the bronze memorial of Emmeline Pankhurst erected in 1930. Suffragette direct action has long been a source of fascination. What is less well known is that militants played little part in the movement after 1918. It was law-abiding constitutionalists – suffragists rather than suffragettes – who pushed through the 1920s to win votes for the younger and poorer women who did not yet have them. Rathbone helped lead this final phase of the campaign, along with Conservative MP Nancy Astor and others.', 'Rathbone was highly critical of the militants, and once claimed that they “came within an inch of wrecking the suffrage movement, perhaps for a generation”. Today, with climate groups including Just Stop Oil copying the suffragette tactic of vandalising paintings, it is worth remembering that many women’s suffrage campaigners opposed such methods.', 'Schismatic though it was, the suffrage movement at least had a shared goal. An even greater challenge for feminists in the 1920s was agreeing on future priorities. Equal pay, parental rights and an end to the sexual double standard were among demands that had broad support. After the arrival in the House of Commons of the first female MPs, legislative successes included the removal of the bar on women’s entry to the professions, new rights for mothers and widows’ pensions. But there were also fierce disagreements.', 'Tensions between class and sexual politics were longstanding, with some on the left regarding feminism as a distraction. The Labour MP Marion Phillips, for example, thought membership of single-sex groups placed women “in danger of getting their political opinions muddled”. There was also renewed conflict over protective legislation – the name given to employment laws that differentiated between men and women. While such measures included maternity leave and safety rules for pregnant women, many feminists believed their true purpose was to keep jobs for men – and prevent female workers from competing.', 'Underlying such arguments was the question of whether women, once enfranchised, should strive for equal treatment, or push for measures designed to address their specific needs. As the debate grew more heated, partisans on either side gave themselves the labels of “old” and “new” feminists. While the former, also called equalitarians, wanted to focus on the obstacles that prevented women from participating in public life on the same terms as men, the new feminists led by Rathbone sought to pioneer an innovative, woman-centred politics. Since this brought to the fore issues such as reproductive health and mothers’ poverty, it is known as “maternalist feminism”.', 'The faultline extended beyond Britain. But Rathbone and her foes had some of the angriest clashes. At one international convention, Lady Rhondda, a wealthy former suffragette, used a speech to deride rivals who chose to “putter away” at welfare work, instead of the issues she considered important.', 'The specific policy points at issue have, of course, changed over the past century. But arguments about how much emphasis feminists should place on biological differences between men and women carry on.', 'Eleanor Rathbone did not live long enough to see the welfare state, including child benefit paid to mothers, take root in postwar Britain. Her election to parliament coincided with the Depression, and the lengthening shadows of fascism and nazism meant that she, like her colleagues, became preoccupied with foreign affairs. In the general election of 1935, the number of female MPs fell from 15 to nine, meaning Rathbone’s was one of just a handful of women’s voices. She used hers to oppose the policy of appeasement, and support the rights of refugees, including those escaping Franco’s Spain. During the war she helped run an extra-parliamentary “woman-power committee”, which advocated for female workers.', 'She also became a supporter of Indian women’s rights, though her liberal imperialism led to tensions with Indian feminists. During the war she angered India’s most eminent writer, Rabindranath Tagore, and its future prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, when she attacked the Congress party’s policy of noncooperation with Britain’s war effort. Tagore criticised what he called the “sheer insolent self-complacency” of her demand that the anti-colonial struggle should be set aside while Britain fought Germany.', 'Rathbone turned down a damehood. After their first shared house in Westminster was bombed, she and her life partner, the Scottish social worker Elizabeth Macadam, moved around the corner to a flat on Tufton Street (Macadam destroyed their letters, meaning that Rathbone’s intimate life remains obscure, but historians believe the relationship was platonic). From there they moved to a larger, quieter house in Highgate. On 2 January 1946, Rathbone suddenly died.', 'A blue plaque on Tufton Street commemorates her as the “pioneer of family allowances” – providing an alternative claim on posterity for an address more commonly associated with the Brexit campaign, since a house a few doors down became its headquarters. She is remembered, too, in Liverpool, where her experience of dispersing welfare to desperately poor soldiers’ wives in the first world war changed the course of her life, and where one of her former homes is being restored by the university.', 'I don’t believe in ghosts. But walking in Westminster recently, I imagined her hastening across St James’s Park to one of her meetings at Nancy Astor’s house near the London Library. Today, suffragettes are celebrated for their innovative direct action. But Rathbone blazed a trail, too, with her dedication as a campaigner, writer, lobbyist and “100% feminist” parliamentarian.', 'Sexed: A History of British Feminism by Susanna Rustin is published by Polity Press (£20).

On three previous occasions Labour has come to power after prolonged periods of Conservative rule, and each was accompanied by a powerful sense of sociocultural transformation.', 'History, as Mark Twain observed, doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes. Can Starmer inspire a similar effect that resonates far beyond parliament, or will it be a case of different party, same problems?', 'After 10 years of the Tories, Clement Attlee’s triumph in 1945 saw the birth of the welfare state and a more democratic idea of Britain. In 1964, Labour ended 13 years of torpid Conservatism, and suddenly the postwar monochrome world was awash with creative colour.', 'According to Philip Larkin, sexual intercourse only began in 1963, “Between the end of the ‘Chatterley’ ban/And the Beatles’ first LP.” It wasn’t just poetic licence, because a sexual liberation really was under way, along with a tectonic shift in mores, music, film and fashion.', 'In 1997, 18 long years of Conservatism came to a close as a Things Can Only Get Better optimism flourished. The energy of emerging British bands and artists conveyed the impression, encouraged by Tony Blair, that UK plc was a hip place to do business – at least until the young celebrities decided it was uncool to attend drinks parties with government squares. But there were also real-world improvements, not least in better-funded health and education.', 'Labour can usually rely on the backing of so-called “luvvies”, and a range of creative people signed a letter of support during Blair’s campaign, but there is no artistic movement, creative trend or generational feeling in the air to coincide with Starmer’s rise – no Britpop or YBAs or Trainspotting. He will have to create his own mood music.', 'Because, in conspicuous contrast to 1945, 1964 and 1997, Britain in 2024 doesn’t feel good about itself. Fourteen years of Tory governments have left the economy flatlining and the country depressed, the twin blows of Brexit and Covid having drained national confidence.', 'What, then, will be the cultural themes of Starmer’s Britain, the signs and symbols of renewal and fresh perspective? How will society order itself so we can say this is distinctive? And who will personify the temper of the times?', 'Few observers or voters expect radical changes ahead. The motivation driving many is disillusionment with what’s gone before, rather than excitement about what’s to come.', 'But the delineation of new eras can take shape in unlikely places, and perhaps that’s where we should look for clues as to any potential societal shifts. According to Tom Baldwin, the author of Keir Starmer: The Biography, the new cultural milieu is “not Soho House and Britpop parties. It’s more community football, kids learning flute in school, obscure indie bands from the 1980s.”', 'Starmer is fundamentally unflash, he says. “It’s not Camelot. It’s more Center Parcs.”', 'If Blair and Gordon Brown projected a new meritocracy – an Islingtonian world of modernist restaurants like the long-gone Granita and brash young movers and shakers like the more recently departed Derek Draper – then the Tories who replaced them were more about privileged backgrounds and well-connected social groups.', 'There was the Notting Hill set of David Cameron’s early years (director of strategy Steve Hilton and his wife Rachel Whetstone – remember them?), and then the Chipping Norton set of his second term – featuring such conservative luminaries as Rebekah Brooks and Jeremy Clarkson. Those groups lived on through the Tory administrations that followed, with their Old Etonians and Wykehamists, but they won’t fit into Starmer’s cosmos.', 'Baldwin suggests the political class’s ground zero is set to move to Kentish Town. “That’s where he has spent more than two decades of his life,” says Baldwin. “It’s a huge part of who he is. It’s not chi-chi – there are rough ends of it. On the back of his wallet, it says, ‘Take me home to Kentish Town’”.', 'What separates the Kentish Town set from its precursors is that it is determinedly not a power gathering. It features people like Colin Peacock. Who? Precisely. He’s an old Starmer friend who, aside from university days, has never lived more than 15 minutes from the Labour leader.', 'Peacock doesn’t have any interest in politics, a reason that Starmer finds him a grounding presence.', '“[Starmer] doesn’t locate himself in politics the way most people in politics do,” says Baldwin. “He locates himself in the life he had before he went into politics: family, friends, football.”', 'Hangout: The Pineapple pub', 'Of course, ever since football became a global obsession and mega-business, all politicians have learned to cite it as a key cultural reference point. In Starmer’s case, however, the interest appears to be authentic – even if he’s an Arsenal fan – and grassroots or, more accurately, astroturfroots. “He lives and breathes it,” says Baldwin.', 'So instead of the Campden Hill tennis club that boasts Cameron and the Johnsons as members, the new scene of social leisure could well be the Talacre Community Sports Centre in Kentish Town, where Starmer still plays football on an artificial pitch and also referees games – an unusual pairing of responsibilities that harsher critics might consider a conflict of interest.', 'The problem with football as a unifying concern is that people support different teams. But it would give a large section of the country – namely England – a feel-good factor boost if its team, so far a study in sleep-inducement, actually managed to win the Euros tournament. In 1966, Harold Wilson is said to have quipped that England only win the World Cup when Labour are in government. The flip side is that four years later England were knocked out of the World Cup quarter finals and four days after that Wilson lost the election to Ted Heath’s Tories.', 'Still, Starmer’s tendency to view life through football metaphors may help introduce a more demotic national conversation, and close the cultural gap between the rulers and the ruled. One thing we know is he likes to start out on the left and drift towards the centre, and sometimes, claim his detractors, he even takes up positions on the right wing.', 'Hangout: West stand, the Emirates', 'Just as Blair liked to take advantage of the hospitality of Silvio Berlusconi in Tuscany and Cliff Richard in Barbados, Cameron was a regular in the Balearics and Cornwall, and Johnson was partial to a freebie in Mustique, prime ministerial getaway destinations seem to say something about the occupants of No 10 that may not always be evident when they’re at home.', 'For PMs are not just politicians but also symbols of national interest and approved behaviour. In the age of Just Stop Oil, long-haul holidays are not the done thing.

It is a stretch to describe Peter Kennard’s dark-as-hell photo collages as jokes, but there is certainly shared methodology. Kennard weirds the familiar, creating jarring juxtapositions, and delivering electrifying visual shocks by way of punchline.', 'Archive of Dissent at Whitechapel Gallery covers over 50 years of Kennard’s work. His golden period arrived in the late 1970s and 1980s – the era of Thatcher, the GLC under Ken Livingstone and the protest camps at Greenham Common and Faslane. The political foes were iconic, the protests popular, and a flourishing print culture offered rich material to work from.', 'In Haywain with Cruise Missiles (1980) the wooden cart in John Constable’s beloved painting appears laden with American bombs. Kennard’s work was made the year RAF Greenham Common – in rural Berkshire, 89km west of London – was selected to be used as a nuclear missile bases by the US air force. In Thatcher Unmasked (1986) the former prime minister is seen removing her own face to reveal a death’s head lurking within.', 'He has quite the eye for a striking image. In a recent poster the Palestinian flag appears turned on end with the red trickling out of its triangle like a stream of blood or sand from an hourglass. A group of new works use the global market pages of the Financial Times. Some show furious hands ripping through the paper as though trapped within. In World Markets (2023) they carry charcoal portraits of people whose lives (we might infer) are being depleted in the interests of profit. Lights flick on and off behind the pink pages of Double Exposure (2023) showing familiar images from Kennard’s archive apparently woven into the paper itself, driving home the interrelation of commerce and geopolitics.', 'Kennard’s natural habitats include placards, public walls, pamphlets, flyers and newspaper – including this one. His striking photomontages appeared in the Guardian at key moments in the late 20th century: after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the beginning of negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa in 1990, and on the eve of the first Gulf war in 1991. An informal exhibition design reflects his preference for public sphere over gallery. Dozens of posters are shown in wall-mounted display racks available to flip through; 15,000 free “newspapers” are folded up on the floor of the gallery, there for the taking.', 'Kennard also honours the radical history of Whitechapel Gallery itself, and the former library building it occupies. Twenty-seven of his designs are presented on placards, each of their sticks weighted to the floor by a red industrial vice. He has titled the display People’s University of the East End – a reference, apparently, to a local nickname for the old library’s reading room, a space open to all to read newspapers, books, magazines and political pamphlets. Original newspapers carrying Kennard’s illustrations are displayed on old wooden lecterns in the adjacent gallery.', 'Might there be a spoonful of nostalgia stirred into all this? I think so. Although Kennard continues to make work in response to current events – Trump’s bellicose rhetoric, the war in Ukraine, the climate emergency – there is a self-conscious clunky DIY sensibility to the whole display that harks to a different era. The installation Boardroom (2023) projects the logos and mottoes of companies that profit from conflict (among them BAE Systems) on to an anonymous face printed on to a sheet of newsprint. The board behind is splintered and scuffed, and the clamps and rods used to hold everything in place are stubbornly visible. Perhaps Kennard feels it behoves him to expose the structures within his work, just as he exposes the structural links between conflict and corporate profit.', 'A cluttered vitrine of printed matter and art materials represents Kennard’s work environment and broadcasts his commitment to scalpel, gluepot and inks. The physicality of the original collages is striking – an image of Nelson Mandela’s face emerging between two broken pieces of a sign reading Whites Only/Net Blankes was constructed using an actual wooden sign, presumably obtained from South Africa.', 'What medium would a Kennard leaving art school now turn to? Would he be spray-painting walls? Would he make memes? Would he even have gone to art school?

A\xa0ban on custodial sentences of two years or less would mean that those who were convicted could serve an alternative method of punishment in the community. This would have the benefit of reducing numbers held on remand, as those who were likely to face a non-custodial sentence would be on bail. Administering a community-based restitution is a fraction of the cost of keeping a person in jail. As well as reducing pressure on prisons, this would help support an under-represented but particularly vulnerable group in our society – children of prisoners. It is well established that the outcomes for the families – particularly children – of prisoners are potentially very poor. This is especially true when multiple short sentences are involved that often result in a chaotic and unstable home life for those left behind. These children are more likely to suffer from a range of potentially debilitating outcomes, not least an increased risk of becoming offenders themselves.Name and address supplied', 'More meaningful purpose at the heart of our businesses needs consumers, ie us, to support them, ie buy from them, instead of from cheaper or slightly more convenient\xa0options (“The rich were led to believe they were different.

How can our justice system claim to be blind?', 'A functioning society depends on equality before the law. If crimes are not treated equally and dispassionately by the justice system, we lose trust in democracy and each other. But as sentences begin to be passed on racists who rioted earlier this month, we see once again a blatantly unequal application of the law.', 'Let’s make a couple of obvious comparisons. One was highlighted this week by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). Had those sentenced for their part in the riots this week – who heeded the calls of racist organisers and rampaged through England’s cities – been Muslims inspired by Islamists, they are likely to have been prosecuted as terrorists, potentially facing much longer sentences. Assaulting people in the name of Islam appears to be treated as a far graver crime than assaulting people in the cause of Islamophobia.', 'How were the attacks on mosques, on a hotel housing asylum seekers and on those who have sought to defend refugees not terrorism? Instead, the riots have been prosecuted as though they were random thuggery, although they emerge from a long and organised campaign of hatred directed towards asylum seekers, immigrants and Muslims. Some of those convicted were reported as having been “caught up” in the disorder: they were portrayed as weak people gone astray. No such understanding is extended to jihadists. As Rusi explains, the UK has a genuine two-tier justice system. It treats some people – white, non-Muslim – as though they act from blind anger, and others – Brown, Muslim – as coordinated terrorists, even when they commit the same crimes.', 'Far-right terrorists and Islamist terrorists are essentially the same. Both tend to hate women, while claiming at the same time to be protecting them and protecting children. Both tend to hate Jews. Both hate any deviation from their beliefs, their culture and their demands. Both are motivated by a powerful sense of humiliation, resentment and vengeance. Both draw encouragement from agitators: Nigel Farage, Suella Braverman and Elon Musk could be seen as secular hate preachers. Both movements are connected to international networks. Yet the two are treated entirely differently.', 'Why? It’s not only the police who are institutionally racist, but the entire system. Islamophobia has long been used as a racist code by mainstream politicians. They cannot overtly appeal to a hatred of Black and Brown people, but they can use Islam as a proxy for race, making common cause with a grim but often electorally significant constituency. This, it seems to me, is what the Tory leadership candidate Robert Jenrick did last week.', 'But there’s an even more obvious comparison with the way the racist riots have been handled, and that is with the prosecution of environmental protesters. It is true that only the first clutch of riot cases have so far gone to court, and longer sentences may yet be handed down. But what we have seen is that violent disorder and assaults on the police have so far attracted shorter prison terms than those imposed for peaceful protest. In fact, the longest sentence for a rioter to date (three years) is shorter than the sentences (four and five years) imposed last month on Just Stop Oil campaigners.', 'As the judge in the Just Stop Oil case pointed out, the protesters caused major disruption by blocking the M25. They inflicted an economic cost of £770,000. No one, including the defendants, expected them to escape punishment. But,whether you agree with Just Stop Oil’s tactics or not, by any standards their nonviolent protest, whose aim was to protect us all from harm, was a far less serious crime than the violence on the streets this month, whose perpetrators deliberately inflicted injury and massive, indiscriminate criminal damage. The riots did not just inconvenience people, they terrorised them. When civil disobedience is punished more severely than racist rioting, something has gone badly wrong.', 'The inequality looks even starker when you compare the Just Stop Oil protests with the fuel protests in 2000. The first day of protest that year was organised by the Conservative party, which saw fuel taxes as an opportunity to attack the Labour government. Two months later, in September, the campaign erupted into a nationwide shutdown by a coalition of lorry drivers and farmers. They blockaded oil refineries and fuel depots across the country. Nearly three-quarters of filling stations ran dry, supermarkets began rationing food, ambulance services were severely disrupted, schools shut, bus and train services were suspended, operations were cancelled and the NHS was put on red alert.', 'Simultaneously, the protesters blockaded motorways with convoys of slow-moving trucks. Transport across much of Britain ground to a halt. The cost to businesses was estimated at £1bn, which in those days was real money. No one even bothered to document the missed hospital appointments, school days, work days, flights and funerals (of which the judge Christopher Hehir made so much in sentencing the Just Stop Oil protesters), as millions of people had to cancel their plans.', 'The result? As far as I can discover, not a single organiser or activist was prosecuted. Far from it: the first convener of the September protests, Brynle Williams, used his resultant celebrity to get elected as a Conservative member of the Welsh parliament, where he was treated as a pillar of the establishment. Six weeks after the protests, Gordon Brown, the Labour chancellor, gave the blockaders much of what they wanted, cutting fuel and vehicle taxes.', 'What made the difference? Sure, the Tories introduced vicious new laws in 2022 and 2023 which were used to prosecute the Just Stop Oil protesters for their far smaller disruptions. But in 2000 there were already plenty of laws criminalising the kind of actions the fuel protesters took.', 'The difference was that the fuel protesters had the backing of the billionaire press and other powerful players. The Tory leader, William Hague, described them as “fine, upstanding citizens”. None of this should make any difference to the way the justice system handles crime: an offence is an offence, whether or not powerful people approve. But time and again, we see police, crown prosecutors and the judiciary moved by the same fear and favour that distorts every aspect of public life, from government budgets to the BBC’s editorial decisions.', 'The justice system claims to be blind to identity. It claims to prosecute people for the crimes they commit, regardless of who they are. But we know this is not true.

None of us is.', 'We face the greatest predicament humankind has confronted: the erosion and possible collapse of our life-support systems. Its speed and scale have taken even scientists by surprise. The potential impacts are greater than any recent pandemic, or any war we have suffered. Yet the effort to persuade people of the need for action has been left almost entirely to either the private or voluntary sectors. And it simply does not work.', 'Why? The first reason is that we are massively outgunned. For every pound or dollar spent on persuasion by an environmental charity or newspaper, the oil, chemicals, automotive, livestock and mining sectors will spend a thousand. They snap up the cleverest and most devious communicators to craft their messages, offering salaries no one else can afford. Among others, they pay a BBC in-house content studio to make their films. The BBC’s offer of “our century-long pedigree as the world’s most trusted storytellers” can be used to massage the reputations of the fossil fuel and pesticide companies it now works for.', 'The second is that, however inclusive we try to be, we will always be seen as a faction. Who are we to tell anyone else how to behave? We are, for many, antagonists, regardless of how we frame our messages. Business and the media see us as enemies of aspiration, seeking to limit the consumption they are trying to boost. Despite the best efforts of sincere organisations such as the Conservative Environmental Network, we will generally (in most cases, correctly) be perceived as leftwing. Our endorsement of a cause will automatically trigger some people’s rejection.', 'And our instruments are limited. Whenever environmental persuaders start making progress, their most eye-catching methods are prohibited: for instance, by the 1986 Public Order Act, the 1994 Criminal Justice Act, the 2000 Terrorism Act, the 2005 Serious Organised Crime Act, the 2022 Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act and the 2023 Public Order Act. Between them, they criminalise even the tamest and most traditional attempts to generate public interest, such as marching slowly down a street or chaining yourself to the railings.', 'When we fail, we blame ourselves or are blamed by others. But we might as well chastise ourselves for an inability to levitate parliament. There are certain things the private sector does well, and certain things it cannot do. As a private trader in environmental persuasion, I feel obliged to state that my profession is, when it stands alone, futile.', 'It’s as if we were facing the threat of invasion, and the government had left citizens’ groups to prepare for it: persuading people to manufacture weapons, build defensive structures and enlist in the armed services. At the same time, if the citizens’ groups persuaded too hard, they would be arrested and thrown into prison.', 'All we can achieve by these means is petty, incremental change. The plural of incremental change is not system change. The plural of incremental change is failure.', 'Mass mobilisation behind a common good needs to be led by government. State persuasion campaigns have been run both well and badly. The UK government once produced dozens of films about road safety, some of which were highly effective; fire safety and public health (Rabies Means Death; Aids: Don’t Die of Ignorance). Some of its films now seem oddly specific: Don’t Put a Rug on a Polished Floor, Playing with Old Fridges Kills. Some government films speak from an age of forgotten decency, such as an information reel on tenants’ rights. Some, by contrast, were pernicious, such as the US government’s Boys Beware advert, which cautioned young men to  “watch out for homosexuals”.', 'The UK government is at present running public information campaigns on cancer, diabetes, smoking, obesity, neonatal care, vaccines and mental health. Most are weak; some are used as a substitute for spending or regulation. But even the Tories knew that the private and voluntary sectors could not raise public health awareness alone.', 'As far as I can tell, the last significant government persuasion drive on an environmental issue was its 2019 Love Water campaign. It was, to say the least, wet. It seemed almost deliberately to eschew effective messaging. Why? Perhaps because among the campaign partners were the private water companies. To return to the military metaphor, it was as if our government had asked the German leadership to help craft its second world war mobilisation messages.', 'The efficacy of a government campaign depends to a large extent on two factors: a sense of moral seriousness (conspicuously lacking from the water campaign) and ubiquity. If everyone is hearing the same message at the same time and if that message appeals directly to a common moral core, it tends to be taken seriously. If it is well crafted, it quickly becomes a national project. As we saw in the first phase of the Covid pandemic and during the two world wars, when the government delivers a universal message instructing us to pull together for a higher purpose, almost everyone tends to accept the need for joint endeavour and we rise to a sense of duty and common purpose. So why does it fail to alert people to the environmental crisis?', 'Failing is an active decision, with major consequences. It makes environmental legislation much harder to sell to the public and to parliament. It also suggests the issue can’t be a big deal. Lurking in many people’s minds, I suspect, is the thought: “If the environmental crisis were really so serious, someone would stop me. Surely I wouldn’t be able to drive this SUV, or take a dozen flights a year, or eat beef or dredged scallops whenever I want? No one I’m prepared to listen to is telling me to stop. So the issues the greens keep blethering about cannot be real.”', 'Climate and environmental science denial, having retreated between 2008 and 2017, are back with a vengeance, fuelled by corporate and political campaigns – many of which operate below the radar – and amplified by social media.

Amid escalating far-right violence across the UK over the past week, the instigators and apologists for the rioting have sought to spread a pernicious myth: the idea that white far-right “protesters” are the victims of a “two-tier” policing system that treats them more harshly because of their race and political views.', 'It’s an idea that has been propagated by Tommy Robinson, Laurence Fox, and various other rightwing social media demagogues in the past few days; it has even been blamed for an arson attack on a police station in Sunderland. Yesterday, Reform MP Nigel Farage claimed that “ever since the soft policing of the Black Lives Matter protests, the impression of two-tier policing has become widespread”. Spend more than a few minutes on social media looking at posts supportive of the violence, and the phrase “two-tier policing”, or a hashtag referring to the prime minister, #twotierkeir, is likely to come up.', 'For an idea that is gaining significant traction, though, there is very little good evidence available that supports it. Today’s newsletter, with public order policing expert Graham Wettone and reporting from the Guardian’s police and crime correspondent Vikram Dodd, separates the claims being made by the far right from the reality. Here are the headlines.', 'Middle East | Iran has called in foreign ambassadors based in Tehran to assert its moral duty to punish Israel for what it sees as its “adventurism” in assassinating Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader, in the Iranian capital. Many leaders in the Gulf are willing to condemn Israel’s actions but have also been calling for Iran to show restraint.', 'Far right riots | Downing Street has criticised comments by Elon Musk, who posted on X that “civil war is inevitable” in the UK. After Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said that “there’s no justification for comments like that”, Musk later attacked Starmer’s promise to protect Muslim communities, writing: “Shouldn’t you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?”', 'Economy | Wall Street suffered its worst day in almost two years after a global stock market sell-off sparked by fears of recession in the US. But Japanese stocks soared more than 10% early on Tuesday, while other Asian markets also appeared to have settled somewhat.', 'Bangladesh | The prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, has resigned and left the country, the head of the army has confirmed, amid some of the worst violence since the birth of the south Asian country more than 50 years ago.', 'Media | More than 18 months since a horrific accident on the set of Top Gear, Andrew “Freddie” Flintoff has revealed his struggles with anxiety, nightmares and flashbacks after suffering life-changing injuries. Flintoff was driving an open-topped three-wheel car when it flipped and slid along the track at Surrey’s Dunsfold aerodome in December 2022.', 'One index of the mainstreaming of the idea of two-tier policing: yesterday Keir Starmer, home secretary Yvette Cooper, Conservative leadership hopeful Priti Patel and the Metropolitan police chief Sir Mark Rowley were all asked about it.', 'Cooper, Starmer, and Patel all rejected the claim. (Rowley said nothing, but grabbed at the reporter’s microphone.) That establishment consensus probably does little to persuade the conspiratorially minded that the proposition is untrue – but the reality is that the evidence does not support it.', '“There are tiers in policing response,” said Graham Wettone, who spent 30 years in frontline public order roles with London’s Metropolitan police and is the author of a book, How To Be A Police Officer. “Of course there are – because you make operational decisions appropriate to the severity of the situation. But there are not tiers based on preference or favouritism.”', 'What is the origin of the claims?', 'Far-right agitators online support their theory by pointing to the policing failures that allowed organised grooming gangs of predominantly Asian men to operate in Rochdale in the 2000s. They also claim that the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 were treated with kid gloves.', 'The Rochdale scandal has at least some basis in the reality that the abuse there was scandalously ignored by police. But the argument that it is a factor in policing today ignores major reforms to the way child sexual exploitation is treated in the region, including the addition of a specialist unit in Greater Manchester police and every Ofsted inspection since 2014 finding that Rochdale now responds to reported cases effectively. Meanwhile, a major Home Office study published in 2020 found no evidence that any one ethnic group is over-represented in cases of child sexual exploitation, and that “group-based offenders are most commonly white”.', 'The Black Lives Matter protests, meanwhile, were qualitatively different from the events of the last week, as centrally organised protests where any disorder was a relatively marginal feature rather than their guiding purpose. Priti Patel rejected the comparison, saying: “There’s a clear difference between effectively blocking streets or roads being closed to burning down libraries, hotels, food banks and attacking places of worship.”', '“There was actually plenty of criticism of the BLM policing for being heavy-handed,” Wettone points out. “The Met used an advance of the mounted branch, one of their most impactful tactics, which I’ve only seen deployed a couple of times in my whole career, and not at any of the incidents in the last week.”', 'Then there are the points that the far right tend to simply ignore because they are unhelpful to their case. The most obvious of these is the way that environmental protest has been policed and treated in the courts – take the five Just Stop Oil campaigners recently jailed for upwards of four years for planning to block the M25. While the sentencing is not a police matter, it hardly points to a system that is hopelessly biased to the left. The draconian sentences handed down after the 2011 riots point in the same direction.', 'There is meanwhile evidence that the Metropolitan police is still riven by institutional racism. A report by Dame Louise Casey in March found “racism, misogyny and homophobia in plain sight” in the Met, and that stop and search and the use of force are still used excessively against Black people.', 'How have the claims gained traction?', 'Against that backdrop, the claims of a two-tier system had gained currency even before the events of the last week, with claims about the policing of the pro-Palestinian protests in the UK since the 7 October attacks. Robert Jenrick, now a Conservative leadership candidate, claimed in March that two-tier policing governed the police’s handling of those protests.', 'Meanwhile, those on the far right have claimed the treatment of recent unrest in Harehills, Leeds after children from a Roma family were taken into care revealed the police were unwilling to act when the agitators were from a minority background. And videos have circulated on social media in recent days of what are claimed to be “Asian gangs” attacking white “protesters” with impunity.', 'But these claims don’t stand up to scrutiny either. All of the evidence of those who attended and monitored the Gaza protests suggests that while there were pockets of disorder, the vast majority of those who attended did so peacefully. “There were arrests, and police identifying offences that have led to prosecutions,” Wettone said. “But those who stayed within the law were rightly allowed to protest.”', 'There were claims then, too, that there were “extremists from all sides” responsible for disorder on Armistice Day that was in fact the product of the far right. This piece from November explains the clear difference between the two sides’ behaviour.', 'The circumstances in Harehills, meanwhile, were very different: West Yorkshire police were the direct target of the unrest, arguably making their presence an exacerbating factor. “It started out looking like a standard call that many officers will go to, an incident at an address with social services trying to remove children,” said Wettone. “And then it blew up with officers coming under attack – the fact that some of them turned their backs and ran away suggests they had received minimal public order training. And because of how quickly it escalated, withdrawal is the best tactic.”', 'Some of the videos of “Asian gangs” do appear to be real recordings from the last few days – and there was an intense confrontation between the far right and a group of Asian men in Bolton. But the scale of these incidents pales in comparison to the far-right activity of the past week, and does not justify headlines framing events of Sunday as equal clashes between the two sides. “Clearly there have been some incidents,” Wettone said. “But it does’t seem to be pre-planned in the same way, and the police can’t generally stop a group of lads walking down the road if no crime has been committed.”', 'How has the violence of the past week been policed?', 'The bottom line is this: the level of the violence, and the fact that it was not an occasional byproduct of the gatherings but their deliberate and persistent aim, puts them in a qualitatively different category from the other policing operations that have been mentioned.', 'So does the fact that these “protests” that have turned into riots were not organised in consultation with the police, like those over Gaza, but set up chaotically and with contempt for the idea that they should be subject to the law.', 'Chief constable BJ Harrington, the national lead for public order policing, put it like this to Vikram Dodd: “We have seen large groups of people coming together intent on one thing, violence. They masquerade as protesters … We have not seen this level of violence or planned intent of violence from other large marches. This is not about being frustrated or wanting to give the police the runaround to get publicity, this is about trying to frighten communities, damage property and attack police officers.”', 'A different approach is therefore warranted, Wettone said. “It isn’t about numbers.

What’s the best way for our uniformed law enforcers to go about their job? Should they pile in with truncheons and teargas? Should they drag people off the roads? Should they stand stony-faced and neutral, or talk to the protesters, or even give the thumbs up? What’s the best way to police protest?', 'A piping hot topic, you will agree. But the series, which finished last week, was made before the riots of the past few days, and so is mostly concerned with the Just Stop Oil and other climate crisis protests, and the rolling pro-Palestine marches that have been taking place in many cities every weekend since last autumn. Policing Protest is simultaneously highly relevant and completely out of date.', 'The BBC’s home editor, Mark Easton, presents with gravity and care. There’s something old-school about his tone, which is fair and decent and just a bit lofty: at the end, he solemnly announces that “the truth about modern Britain will be found at the barricade”. This, after a madly posh actor has given us a reading of the last few lines of The Masque of Anarchy, the poem Shelley wrote after the Peterloo massacre in Manchester in 1819. (You know it: the “Rise like lions after slumber” part that ends with “Ye are many – they are few”.) Peterloo is upsetting and enraging, but the story has been told many times over, and I’m not sure that a fruity declamation helps much with the retelling.', 'Still, there are many interesting and salient points made in Policing Protest, the most crucial being that the police are struggling to manage the sheer amount of protests now taking place. One interviewee calls it “chronic”: every weekend, police have to be called in from other areas just to manage what’s going on in London. Holidays and breaks are being cancelled; the police are at the end of their tether. (God knows how they’ve been coping over the past week or so.) Easton is good on the actual point of policing and the fundamental dichotomy at the centre of the job. The longstanding philosophy behind our police is that they police by consent. But actually, the force came about because the state wanted to quash dissent. These two tenets – controlling crowds and being a community service – are in opposition with each other and can clash in moments of protest. Or, as Easton puts it: “It’s about the limits we place on dissent – a debate we’ve been having for 200 years.”', 'There is so much packed into this short series: what the Riot Act actually was, how Thatcher increased police powers, how the Black Lives Matter protests were managed, how public space is being reduced. But everyone interviewed, from police to academics to protesters, is reasonable, educated, thoughtful. And, as we can see from recent events, sometimes people are just riled up and want to smash things: what happens then?', 'Sign up to Observed', ""Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers"", 'after newsletter promotion', 'Now, a couple of gentle, slightly offbeat series to cleanse the palette. Gemma Cairney, whose enthusiasm and hard-to-pigeonhole attitude has led her to present a variety of shows on 1Xtra, 6Music and Radio 4, hosts Dream Space, a series for Factory International, the art producers based in Manchester. It’s yet another interviews-of-famous-people show, but Cairney’s upbeat sweetness makes it a lovely listen. Season one featured artists such as Es Devlin, Lemn Sissay and Maxine Peake; this one starts with the celebrated Mancunian DJ, DJ Paulette.', 'Paulette talks us through her ideal dream space, which involves water and music and her family, who all dance as soon as their song plays. It sounds silly written down, but because it’s audio it works: as Paulette speaks, we imagine, along with Cairney. We create our own images – our own dreamscape – to go along with Paulette’s.', 'Sing It Pink is a new podcast series executive-produced by the producers of The Log Books. It tells the history of the Pink Singers, the longest-running LGBTQ+ choir in Europe – they celebrated their 40th anniversary last year. I loved hearing about the origins of the choir, and the descriptions of ye olde Brixton scene. The second episode, about the devastation of Aids, is moving, especially the descriptions of performing for the sick at the London Lighthouse wards.', 'The songs can be a little musical theatre for my taste, and I would have liked some more dynamism in the telling (though this may come when the Pinkies go to sing at Pride marches in Warsaw and Kyiv). This is a lovely series and a history that definitely needs telling.', 'I’ve been dipping in and out of the BBC Proms and can recommend last Sunday’s Prom 21, conducted by John Wilson and played by the Sinfonia of London, which took on the works of 20th-century American composers, including Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue. There’s something about massed strings and American composition that can feel a bit Disney, but this performance brought out the weird darkness beneath. Wynton Marsalis played a new piece, Herald, Holler and Hallelujah!; we also heard John Adams’s Harmonielehre, apparently inspired by a dream of an oil tanker rising out of San Francisco bay. Spectacular.', 'Finally, audiobooks don’t fall under my reviewer’s remit but I must mention one I’m really enjoying at the moment: Hip-Hop Is History by Questlove (of the Roots). The opening introduction, in which he describes the stress of putting together a special hip-hop performance for the Grammys, had me on the edge of my seat with tension and delight.']",['Miranda Sawyer'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16dc459e4529dcf8758bf330210105d60c81dcba/0_23_3090_1854/master/3090.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'Rioters facing off against a line of police in Liverpool'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8709854cf5fb15697de435199cb7595dacf8c11/0_0_1920_2400/master/1920.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'DJ Paulette.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00b18f1a40f0a01cd2f9843b00bc298f31d4c229/0_405_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'The Pink Singers']]",

And how is that working out for us all?”', 'In 2023, sewage spills in England increased by 54% from the previous year, according to the Environment Agency. A study also released in 2023 showed that enough raw sewage to fill 4,352 Olympic swimming pools was released from 30 water treatment works in one year. And yet shareholders must still be paid: analysis conducted by the Financial Times showed that UK water companies paid out £1.4bn in dividends in 2022, up £540m from the previous year. There are news items every day: swimmers are told to sign up for water-quality alerts; paddling children and triathletes contract vomiting bugs. Local Facebook groups – such as one for the River Severn, near where I grew up – share stories of vile smells and videos of strange froths. When I see talk online about its condition it feels like a personal affront: how could someone do this to my river? Meanwhile, the River Lea, the Thames tributary closest to where I live now, is described as “dangerously polluted” with “high levels of faecal E coli”. The river valley is one of my favourite parts of London, but I wouldn’t want to fall in, let alone swim.', 'For most of us, the direct debit leaves our bank account and we go on with emptying the washing-up bowl and flushing the loo, feeling powerless or just forgetting. But a number of people are looking at their water bills and deciding that they’ve had enough. That they won’t pay any more.', '“We are paying for a service that we are just not getting; a service we absolutely have to have,” says Caz Dennett, founder of the Don’t Pay for Dirty Water campaign. “We don’t have a choice in creating the sewage in the first place and we don’t have a choice in who we take the service from. People are really aware that they’re being ripped off.” Campaigners such as Dennett see refusing to pay their water bills as the only way to do something.', '“I would call it a developing and growing movement, because of the inherent injustice,” says Katy Colley, a founder of Boycott Water Bills. “As a people we are really wedded to the idea that things should be fair. And this just isn’t fair.”', 'Colley and her family run a campsite in Hastings. Her local water company is Southern Water and she has been withholding wastewater charges since December 2022. (Southern Water is majority-owned by the Australian investor Macquarie, which has been criticised for its stewardship of Thames Water and in July came under fire for awarding its chief executive a £183,000 bonus.) A friend had previously mentioned the idea to her, but she forgot about it until she was galvanised by a bout of E coli. It was summer and Colley and her family had been hanging out at the beach. “We were having a great time in the water,” she says. “And then that night I got ill. You wouldn’t wish E coli on anyone. It’s just awful. It really affected me. When my next water bill came I thought, ‘I’m going to do it and I’m going to complain at the same time. I’m going to see how far I can take this.’”', 'Colley found a group of withholders in Whitstable. They teamed up and launched Boycott Water Bills in May 2023. So far more than 13,000 people have visited the site for advice.', 'One of the Whitstable withholders is writer Julie Wassmer, who ceased making payments in 2021, alongside friends, including Emma Gibson, a former Greenpeace campaigns manager, Green party councillor Steve Wheeler and then-Conservative councillor Ashley Clark. “We did so, not as a campaign, but as a group of committed individuals who wanted to make a stand,” she says. News of their action hit the local press and was amplified by Bob Geldof, who lives in nearby Faversham. Wassmer notes that since starting Boycott Water Bills with Colley, “We’ve been contacted by thousands of people from across the country, as well as other groups, such as Extinction Rebellion, and we now have boycott action in all 11 wastewater areas.”', 'Jim Murray is an actor, known for playing Prince Andrew in The Crown. He began fly fishing some years ago, finding that it helped him after the death of his baby daughter in 2009. “Nothing had really helped me get through the trauma,” he says, “but fishing did, for whatever reason.” He started to become invested in the health of rivers, especially his local Hampshire chalk streams. “I vowed to give the rivers back what they had given me,” he says. “They saved me and I felt I needed to save them.”', 'Murray also falls into Southern Water’s catchment area and is currently only paying the supply part of his bill “because I genuinely believe we’re not getting the service for the wastewater part”. He has leveraged his celebrity to found the group Activist Anglers, create the podcast The Last Salmon and get into talks with Southern Water. “I am very clear with them,” he says. “Just because we’re talking doesn’t mean I trust you. It would be absolutely remiss of me if I suddenly gave up my activism and protesting.”', 'In Weymouth, Dennett’s water is supplied by Wessex, who typically bill six months in advance. “And, like a good little citizen, for 15 years I did that,” she says. “And then I just thought, ‘I’m not going to pay for this.’ I paid, in advance, for all those years only for them to take that money and give it straight to their shareholder.” (Wessex Water has just one shareholder, the Malaysian multinational YTL Corporation Berhad.) By late July this year, after two years of non-payment, Wessex served Dennett with a legal action notice for the total of her unpaid amount. She says she intends to defend her case and possibly counter-sue if she can compile the needed evidence.', 'Dennett has joined with Extinction Rebellion to make Don’t Pay For Dirty Water a national campaign. The group says their aim is to sign up 10,000 boycotters.', 'There are some who are withholding independently, without a group or campaign around them. Devon-based Imogen May is probably the best known. She has been withholding her water bill since 2019. In June, when her non-payments to South West water totalled £2,809, the company seized a stake in her home via the Land Registry (weeks after an outbreak of diarrhoea caused by a parasite in Devon’s water supply led to some customers having to boil their drinking water). “I am using this house,” she says. “I’m in a position of privilege and this is a tool. My children have their own homes now and I’m doing this on my terms. Unless people stand up and say no, this will continue.', '“I swim in the rivers. I swim in the sea. And it hurts, what they are doing, what they are getting away with. It actually hurts.” She is currently deciding if she can risk the expense of going to court. There are, however, many stages a non-payer will reach before legal action or loss of property.', 'Domestic users cannot, by law, have their water supply cut off or restricted. Non-payment will escalate through several levels, starting with the reminder notices familiar to anyone with a bad memory, especially before the days of direct debit. The water company will then send a notice for each unpaid bill, giving the customer seven days to pay. That should be followed by a telephone call and then the debt will be passed to a debt-recovery agent. Then, says Citizens Advice, “The company can take you to court to get a county court judgement to recover the money you owe. You may then get a notice of enforcement from a firm of bailiffs telling you they are going to come round. If they come, they could take goods to sell to pay the money you owe.”', 'In practice, this can take several months. “To begin with, I didn’t even write to them and complain,” says Dennett about Wessex Water. “I thought I would just see how it played out and how long it took them to catch up with me.” However, her experience talking with non-payers around the country has shown that the timing and severity of the response can vary from company to company, “and sometimes how you are treated can even be down to the customer service rep you speak to on a given day”.', 'There are varying levels of engagement and various ways to make the process longer. The first level of disrupting the supply of what Dennett calls “free-flowing money” is to stop paying in advance and switch to monthly payments. Following that, some activists have chosen to cancel automated payments and to stop paying all or a portion of their bill. The most popular action seems to be to continue paying for supply, but withholding the wastewater charges. On their website, Boycott Water Bills say people should complain to their water providers in writing. They continue: “Insist in your communication that while you are disputing this part of your bill they should not chase you for payment or refer your case to a debt-collection agency.', 'Not paying a bill can adversely affect your credit score and receiving a county court judgement will affect it even further. Those who have previously built up good credit, particularly those who own homes, could be more insulated from the worst aspects, but there will be an effect for everyone. Both Boycott Water Bills and Don’t Pay For Dirty Water acknowledge that refusing to pay can create difficulties. “Our advice is always not to risk your financial good name,” says Dennett. “Don’t do this if you are in a precarious financial position.”', 'Each non-payer has a personal tipping point, but the main source of anger is that, as they see it, a stated service is not being provided – adequate sewage management –and that both the environment and public health are being degraded. “You look at how these water companies are run and you don’t just feel great about boycotting, you feel absolutely ethically OK,” says Murray. “The ethics are so barren and thin on the ground. The institution cares not one jot about the destruction it’s bringing on the assets, in this case the waters in the river. All it cares about is profit.”', '“The water companies call us customers, but we’re not really – customers have the choice to take their custom elsewhere,” says Dennett. Because of the monopoly companies have, a bill-payer dissatisfied with the service from, say, Thames, cannot switch their supplier to Severn Trent.', 'Then there is the issue of where the money is going. Data released by the Labour party at the beginning of this year showed that the chief executives of nine water companies received a total of £25m on top of their salaries since 2019. “Money is just leaking out,” says Colley, referring to executive pay and shareholder dividends. And, while this happens, bills rise and infrastructure crumbles. “It’s raw profiteering,” says Dennett. For Julie Wassmer, “it’s infuriating that companies have been allowed to borrow irresponsibly, racking up debt of £60bn, while rewarding executives and shareholders over £70bn.”', 'There is some hope for change. This July, the Manchester Ship Canal Company won a Supreme Court ruling against United Utilities, allowing them to seek redress for unauthorised discharges of foul water. This is the first ruling of its kind and there is now potential for further legal action by the owners and users of waterways.', 'On 11 July, following the general election, Defra were quick to release a statement that promised, among other things, that new funding for infrastructure would be ring-fenced and can only be spent on upgrades benefitting customers and the environment and that nothing can be diverted for bonuses, dividends or salary increases. The money talked about by Defra included £88bn from water companies, but that also meant there would be bill increases.', 'In the raft of new legislation recently announced by Sir Keir Starmer’s government there is a new Water (Special Measures) Bill, which gives powers to levy criminal liability on water company heads for pollution, ban bonuses if environmental standards aren’t met and introduce a new code of conduct. There will also be powers to impose automatic fines for polluting companies and a requirement for them to install real-time monitors on sewage outlets.', 'To those who have been invested in the cause for a long time, the promises feel hollow. “The fact that water company shareholders refuse to invest any more money into their own assets should be plenty enough warning that there’s a serious flaw in the business model but, instead, toothless Ofwat insists on us, the customer, paying for these mistakes. Again,” says Murray. “The industry is a huge con and with Ofwat ruling over it, it will most certainly take the real threat of a national boycott to clearly show government that we’re not as stupid as they think we are and that we demand a fairer system.”', '“The companies want to be allowed to charge customers all over again for infrastructure work they failed to do in the first place, while we customers are adamant they won’t receive a penny until they do what they were originally paid to do,” says Wassmer. “Let them go instead to those who profited from what has become not only a national, but an international, disgrace.”', 'For now, more and more eyes turn towards the practices of our water companies and the activists remain resolved and their bills unpaid: “They can whistle for it,” says Wassmer.']",['Anna Fielding'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ec5dee98a8e708cdb7b317ad939840cd6fe4530/0_1240_6200_3719/master/6200.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', '‘As a people we are really wedded to the idea that things should be fair.

The thermometer has barely dropped below 39C, but despite the heat a 78-year-old woman climbs on to a bench to give an impassioned speech to a 200-strong crowd.', '“Did you think we weren’t going to be here, Señor Almeida?” She scans the crowd, searching for José Luis Martínez-Almeida, Madrid’s mayor, while anguished cries of “Arboricida!” (tree murder) punctuate the silence. Her face is immediately recognisable. She is movie star Marisa Paredes, an actor immortalised in Almodóvar classics such as High Heels – just one of many activists trying to stop what seems like a concerted campaign to strip central Madrid of its trees.', 'Watching a recording of Paredes’s fiery speech, I tear up, amazed at her courage. Like many others, I’ve fled the city for the summer, unable to bear the extreme heat. Madrid is one of the worst heat islands in the world, and its foliage offers a welcome reprieve from unbearable temperatures. But in a move reminiscent of the recent decision in Sheffield to deploy chainsaw-wielding workers to remove trees in the early hours, Almeida’s administration seems to be banking on locals being away to strip Santa Ana of 85% of its tree coverage.', 'The fight to preserve urban tree coverage is a story with increasingly high stakes being played out across the globe from Malta to Hyderabad as locals show extraordinary courage standing up against the interests of big business to demand livable cities. In Madrid, the burning issue has been its city squares, where remodelling work over the past few years has transformed once communal spaces into inhospitably hot concrete expanses that drive tourists straight into the next air-conditioned shop.', 'The issue came to a head in 2023, when plans to build an extension to a metro train line were altered to require the removal of more than 1,000 trees, many in public parks near Madrid’s rewilded riverside. Tired of having their needs ignored by the council, locals came out in force to protest. And it worked: while many trees were lost, just under half those earmarked for removal were saved.', 'But this time, despite opposition, the council hasn’t let up. When the €6.1m (£5.2m) deal to renovate the underground car park beneath Santa Ana went to private contractor Grupo Ortiz, it hastily earmarked trees for removal. The mayor justified this work as necessary due to localised damp problems in the car park – but that is flimsy at best. In a city centre where locals are priced out of the housing market by tourist apartments, who needs residential parking?', 'Even more pressingly, we know tree coverage saves lives. EU research indicates that increasing the tree canopy in urban areas could save hundreds of lives each summer, especially in countries such as Italy, Croatia, Romania and Spain. It’s a relatively inexpensive but effective measure – and with heat deaths in Madrid having risen to 1,308  during the brutally hot summer of 2022, it feels particularly pertinent.', 'There are, of course, other interests at work. Grupo Ortiz stands to make huge profits managing the car park, while the city council also saves itself some cash: it’s much cheaper to rip trees out of the urban fabric and plant saplings far out of town. “There’s money behind all this. The government in Madrid is doing everything it can to encourage more gentrification and more tourism, devastating absolutely everything,” as activist Dolores Méndez of No a la Tala (No to Felling) puts it.', 'This might explain the administration’s heavy-handed approach to protesters in the city. Méndez was fined last year as police forcibly removed activists from trees to allow work on the new metro to start. In defiance of legislation against peaceful protest, she didn’t pay her fine, which has now doubled to €601. Meanwhile, total fines for activists in the city amount to more than €19,000. No a la Tala will be fighting the case in court. Its members will be hoping that not all justice systems are as harsh towards those fighting for the planet as the UK’s, which handed down chillingly harsh sentences to Just Stop Oil protesters in July.', 'Madrid’s hellishly hot summer also sees a dangerous series of legislative changes being rushed through that could scrap a law demanding that trees that are cut down be replaced – a prelude for more unchecked construction work. Sure enough, upcoming plans to build a Formula One track in the city might well involve further destruction, as will plans to build a new transport interchange near the riverside.', 'Back in Plaza de Santa Ana, protests have gathered momentum while rumours swirl that the trees could go at any point. When leafage started to brown, locals discovered that irrigation systems had been switched off and began lugging buckets of water out in the blistering heat to keep the trees alive.', 'At the 11th hour, the incredible resilience of Paredes and activists such as Méndez won out. Two weeks ago, work was halted as the local government agreed to pause proceedings until September and hold talks with residents’ associations. As with the riverside protest, activists have vowed not to let up.

Given that the police have responded to disorder and riots for decades, why is facial recognition needed now?”', 'There is no specific law in the UK regulating the use of facial recognition software and as a result its implementation is broadly defined by police forces, which use it to locate missing persons and offenders, but also, the Met says, “people on a ‘watchlist’ who are sought by the police”.', 'The Met’s policy statement says those put on a watchlist include people “wanted by the courts”, people subject to court or bail restrictions – but also people “where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the individual depicted is about to commit an offence” in the future.', 'Campaigners say that such broad definitions could allow police to target legitimate protesters, not just people with violent intent.

So where does they go with series two? The writer and stars talk about guns, Keir Starmer and 2022’s most unpredictable plot twist', 'At the end of the gripping, Bafta-winning BBC drama Sherwood, which concluded in 2022 after reaching audiences of 7.5 million, a fragile calm seemed to have settled over its fictional former mining town in north Nottinghamshire. The show was the brainchild of prolific local lad James Graham, writer of the National Theatre hit Dear England, with Joseph Fiennes as Gareth Southgate, and TV drama Quiz, which was inspired by the “coughing major” controversy on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. Real events were the basis for Sherwood, too. In 2004, two murders were committed only streets from where Graham grew up. Keith Frogson, a leading member of the NUM, was killed with a crossbow and sword by another ex-miner, though this was later proved to have no link to the miners’ strike, which had divided the community since the mid-1980s. In an unconnected incident, newlywed Chanel Taylor was shot dead by her father. Both killers went to ground in Sherwood Forest before being apprehended.', 'Lightly fictionalising this double manhunt narrative, Graham introduced other ingredients, such as warring sisters whose husbands were on opposite sides of the picket line and a plotline involving the “spy cops” scandal. But how to describe the show, other than as Alan Bleasdale meets Line of Duty? “We eventually made peace with it not being defined by any one genre,” says the 42-year-old writer over video call. “Was it a thriller? Was it state-of-the nation? Was it political? Social? A whodunnit? Comedy or serious? Then we started to relax. And it made me realise I could do whatever I\xa0wanted with the second series.”', 'Season two is directed by acclaimed Yorkshire-born film-maker Clio Barnard. It moves the miners’ strike into the background and digs into a different but no less turbulent period. “I knew that for the second series to keep exploring the wounds and the unique challenges of the ‘red wall’, it made sense to go into one of the defining traumas of that area’s modern history,” says Graham. He is referring to the early 2000s, when levels of gun violence in the city led to it being dubbed Shottingham. “I wanted to use that as a springboard to investigate why certain deindustrialised communities suffered a huge amount of rising criminality and drugs, particularly among young men.”', 'As the new series begins, feelings are running high over proposals for a new mine, prompting a Just Stop Oil-style protest torn from the headlines. The characters are in flux, whether it’s Julie (Lesley Manville), widow of the murdered ex-miner from the first series, who is thinking of selling up, or the criminal Sparrow family contemplating their own futures. Among the fresh faces are a brother and sister, played by David Harewood and Sharlene Whyte, who find themselves fleeing gang violence. Former DCS Ian St Clair (David Morrissey) has left the force and is now heading up a violence intervention team to stem youth crime. He also happens to be single. As Julie drily points out, it probably didn’t help that in his hunt to unmask the community’s former spy cop, he ended up suspecting his own wife.', 'The final episode revealed the true identity of the former member of the Special Demonstration Squad, who had been planted in the area to gather intelligence on the miners and was still living there undetected decades later. Popping up alongside Graham on video call today is the mole herself, Lorraine Ashbourne. She returns as Daphne Sparrow, the one-time SDS officer now balancing her family’s taxi business with petty crime.', '“I’m very proud of the fact that absolutely no one guessed it was Daphne,” says 63-year-old Ashbourne, sitting at home in front of a framed poster for the first Hobbit movie, which starred her husband, Andy Serkis, as Gollum. “I think that’s one of the great achievements of James’s writing.” Graham begs to differ: “You nailed that,” he tells Ashbourne. “How you stayed in the background for most of the scenes demonstrates your lack of ego. You knew the assignment was to be quiet until the end.” An undercover actor, then, as well as an undercover cop.', 'This time, Daphne is front and centre. “I remember reading the new scripts and nearly dying,” says Ashbourne. It turns out Daphne has been hiding something else, which shall remain under wraps here. “I\xa0so didn’t see that coming. What genius! Not only has she lied all her life about being an undercover cop, she’s\xa0also got this other secret.”', 'Daphne meets her match in the form of Ann Branson, played by Monica Dolan, whose previous roles include the serial killer Rose West in Appropriate Adult and the Post Office operator Jo Hamilton, persecuted and prosecuted in this year’s headline-grabbing drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office. As a viewer, Dolan, 55, was glued to the first series of Sherwood. “I made sure to watch it all,” she says. “I wanted to be part of the cultural conversation.” Now she is part of the show itself, and a sinister one at that. Ann, who is out for revenge after the murder of her son, is unmistakably more Rose West than Jo Hamilton. “I’ve known loads of Daphnes,” says Graham. “Basically, she’s all the women I grew up with in my village. But I don’t know a real-life Ann Branson. That would be too scary.”', 'Indeed, it’s hard to reconcile the thoughtful, smiling Dolan with the menacing figure she plays on screen. Her first appearance, glaring down from the public gallery at a suspect in the dock, reducing him to a gibbering wreck without even saying a word, must rank as the greatest TV entrance of the year so far.', 'Ann uses chit-chat the way torturers deploy thumb screws. A trivial question about which vegetables go best with a roast, or where to use “less” and “fewer” in a sentence, invariably disguises or prefaces some unspeakable act. “Very little of what she’s up to was clear on the page,” says Dolan. “I’m very nosy and I like figuring that out. Anne is chatty, but it’s difficult to know what’s at the bottom of it. I loved that.” Not everyone did. “There were one or two executives who maybe wanted to make something a bit clearer. And I was like: ‘Please trust me. Can I just try and play this? Or what we’re going to end up with is dialogue where she explains herself. And she just does not give a shit about other people.’” Playing Anne took her back to the experience of making Appropriate Adult. “Look at the length of time that Fred West managed to fool people. What we don’t realise enough, I think, is that there are lots of ways of being clever. We mix that up with being educated.”', 'Series two ratchets up the suspense – there is a seaside sequence in the second episode involving Daphne and Ann that is almost unbearably tense – but at the core of the show is a community-focused quality that has been there since the start. Would it be wishy-washy to call it healing? “I\xa0don’t think it’s wishy-washy at all,” says Graham. “I think it’s the most important thing. In the first series, I imagined scenes that didn’t happen, like when Leslie’s character goes into the miners’ welfare and says: ‘Can we have this out?’ And the characters do have it out. It’s almost a wish fulfilment – you normalise the desire to talk it out and to heal a bit.”', ""Sign up to What's On"", 'Get the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every Monday', 'after newsletter promotion', 'Never let it be said that drama can’t effect change. Dolan experienced very recently that catalytic power with Mr Bates vs the Post Office. Journalists had been pursuing the Post Office Horizon IT scandal for years and suddenly the drama was spilling off the screen and on to the front pages. “It was quite weird seeing it on the news that much,” she says. “I was extremely proud of the audience for being so collectively angry. People were outraged at the injustice. Then because there was going to be an election – maybe I’m being cynical here – the government had to listen.”', 'As she points out, there’s still a long way to go in the fight for justice. “People lost their homes, their businesses. Alan Bates hasn’t been compensated yet. But yes, it was very heartening. I don’t know any actor of my generation who didn’t start with a fire in their belly, wanting to say something that maybe they don’t have the words for. Wanting to make a difference. I thought: ‘Well, if I get struck by lightning now, I’ve managed to get something that I believe out there, and people have listened.’”', 'Politicians, too. On that subject, I ask what the Sherwood trio’s hopes are for the new government. “I don’t have any soundbites,” says Ashbourne. “But Keir Starmer is saying all the right things. Let’s hope he succeeds.” Although we are speaking a few days before the far-right begin rioting across the UK, Graham has “the public realm and physical community” much on his mind, and hopes the prime minister does, too.', '“Many places have been neglected in terms of the complete underinvestment and the collapse of public entities,” he says. “There are often very few places to actually go. A lot of pubs have closed. Community centres, too. Go to Nottingham city centre and look at the absolute collapse of retail and the high street. Coming down the line is this existential crisis over what is a high street, what is a town centre? It’s not being talked about very much but the desire to be together is still really strong. There needs to be an investment in place, so that people can be together and heal together.

Exemplary in its rigour, it demonstrated convincingly that puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for distressed children have no place in medical practice, unless within a carefully regulated research framework.', 'Astonishingly, part of the leadership of our profession has rejected these clear conclusions.

The Cass review has been condemned by paediatricians and endocrinologists who specialise in transgender healthcare for its dismissal of large-scale studies not using randomised control trials. The ethics of using randomised control trials on people experiencing gender dysphoria should be clear. If\xa0puberty blockers are being used to treat what is ultimately something mental and innate to oneself, depriving a young person of this via a placebo is tantamount to refusal of treatment, which will have untold consequences for the already vulnerable person. Trials using other methods show that puberty blockers are effective in relieving dysphoria – giving the patient time to consider their identity delaying an unwanted puberty.', 'I find the argument that transness is a conduit for other identity issues disingenuous. Teaching every child they aren’t alone in their experiences – whether it’s sexual or gender identity, body image, menstruation, trauma, neurodiversity – creates a non-individualistic mindset that fosters supportiveness of others. Depriving trans youths access to medical treatment from a professional teaches them that they aren’t equal, affecting their mental health and ultimately societal health. We entrust doctors with our health. “We” includes young trans people.Jas Crowe\n London EC1', 'A graduate tax would have been better than student loans – it could have been charged to boomers and others who obtained the advantages of “free” higher education in an earlier generation (“‘I’d be better off if I hadn’t been to uni’: UK graduates tell of lives burdened by student loans”). The only advantage of loans was an accountancy quirk which meant that public expenditure on loans could be negated in the public accounts by the fictional value of future repayments. But those who take out student loans must recognise that being a student is a privilege that many people would like but cannot obtain. It is an investment that carries risks.

End up slumped on the kerb being carried away by men in high-vis vests.', 'It is one of the undiscussed benefits of Paris 2024 that closing roads, ramping up cycle lanes and opening urban walkways has created a really lovely version of this city. The triathlon turned that into a sporting spectacle, a vision of city-friendly carbon-light travel, as enacted by cartoon champions in trainers and two-piece swimming suits.', 'There was always an amusingly blinkered note to the pre-Olympic gloating at the state of the Seine. For the British media this was basically a classic opportunity to titter at the French, presented as just another continental toilets story, a throwback to Bidet Panic, to the long-drop latrine horror talk of the 1980s. Trying to clean a river now. What will these freaks do next?', 'In reality waterways in every country are full of sewage, not least in Britain where the lack of care by privatised water companies, the surge in sewage overflow, the unswimmable state of lakes and rivers, is a scandal of monstrous proportions. Somehow the most basic of all human needs, the element we are basically made of, is being shaved to the bone for the benefit of shareholders.', 'Does cleaning the Seine still sound like such a folly in this light? We hear so much scoffing at the €1.5bn spent. But what do we think this is really worth? When does a clean river become too expensive? These big events are always soundtracked by drivel about legacy and regeneration, words that are used almost exclusively to sell you a scheme. But cleaning the Seine is undoubtedly the best thing Paris 2024 has brought to Paris. What better legacy could there be than don’t throw shit in the river.', 'Sign up to Olympic and Paralympic briefing', 'Our daily email briefing will help you keep up with all the goings on at the Olympics and Paralympics', 'after newsletter promotion', 'The challenge now is to maintain that beyond the current two-week TV show. This is where the optics come in. The insistence on actually hosting swimming events in the Seine may have been deeply pig-headed. It may still turn out to be a terrible idea. Team GB’s athletes have already had their hepatitis jabs and will now complete a course of antibiotics. Who knows what the effects might be of all that tarnished river water combined with the cuts and wounds of assorted crashes, wipeouts and knee slides on the morning cobbles.', 'But the message was in the spectacle. At times, watching the switchover between disciplines, people in swimsuits leaping on and off bikes then pounding away frantically on the cobbles, was like witnessing the world’s worst-ever commute, or a real-life version of that dream where you’re doing all this in the nude en route to giving a full board presentation about project Zeus. What is the point of this deeply stirring display of human will, other than to say, well, some things are just worth doing.', 'The Seine is, after all, why Paris exists in the first place. The Romans made it a trade route. The Vikings pillaged it. France’s own belle époque expanded along its banks. The same river water the athletes were glugging down here also contains ashes of Jeanne d’Arc and the debris of the second world war.', 'And like every major old-world city this place is built on a labyrinth of inherited tunnels. With Paris the key task in this Olympic cycle has been to build a giant rainwater tank. The existing Napoleonic infrastructure takes rain and foul water down the same pipes. Hence the toxic overflow when the rain gets too heavy.', 'Climate change hardly helps. Talking of which, Paris plans to open 26 swimming pools along the Seine, in part as a basic response to the question of how to live in this city as summer temperatures rise. Public bathing. Fish stocks and river foliage. This is the idea. It may or may not come to completion. Hidalgo has already been under pressure over her anti-car reforms. But does it really sound so bad? Paris is basically flagging a problem shared by every city in the world.', 'And so for one morning at least the triathlon – a swim, a bike ride and a run – felt like the centre of the Games. It was above all beautiful, from the silver-grey light on the Seine first thing, to the sun through the clouds as the runners emerged dripping river weed and slurry, pounding off on a kind of amphibious parkour. By the end it seemed clear that everyone involved in this event deserves some kind of medal, not to mention a course of antibiotics and a typhoid shot.', 'Paris 2024 delivered its message here. The challenge now is to hold on to that image. And for Macron, to fulfil his own promise of swimming in the newly cleansed Seine, an ambition Jacques Chirac also shared but never lived to see out. No time like the present, M President.

The region covers parts of six counties – most is in Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire, but also corners of Warwickshire, Wiltshire, Worcestershire and Somerset – is a postcard-pretty holiday destination, and has been a hub for the wealthy since the heyday of the wool trade in the late middle ages.', 'The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

Then there are the stars of Bridgerton filming on the streets of nearby Bath, and traffic jams outside Clarkson’s farm shop, made famous by his TV show.', 'But since I moved here in 2022, I have been searching out the wilder side of the Cotswolds, because to write off the region William Morris called “heaven on Earth” as a playground for the posh does it a disservice. The largest “national landscape” (the new name for areas of outstanding natural beauty) in England and Wales, the Cotswolds is also a surprising treasure trove, home to Roman snails, ancient stone circles and crowds busy chasing cheese down hills. And it’s all crisscrossed by more than 3,000 miles of walking trails. Beyond the pretty villages besieged by coach tours, there are real communities, carefully curated historic gems, a thriving art scene and a clutch of proper pubs.', 'Start by heading away from the green-welly enclaves (such as Castle Combe, Bibury and the Slaughters, both Lower and Upper) to Stroud. The town this newspaper called “one of those rare spots in the countryside where Guardian readers can be out and proud” is a liveable place, and a delightfully alternative one. Stroud is home to climate protest group Extinction Rebellion, the world’s first carbon-neutral and only vegan football club (Forest Green Rovers), what claims to be Britain’s first organic cafe (Woodruffs on the High Street) and a fabulous Saturday farmer’s market, launched in 1999 by Jasper Conran and Isabella Blow. Stroud sits in the heart of the Five Valleys – Painswick, Slad, Toadsmoor, Chalford and Nailsworth – surrounded by rolling green hills that are perfect for exploring on foot, perhaps with a stop for refreshments at Woodchester Valley Vineyard, or at one of my favourite pubs, the Woolpack in Slad, where Cider With Rosie author Laurie Lee once propped up the bar.', 'The ancient commons surrounding Stroud are still grazed by cattle, and are part of the National Trust’s Stroud Landscape Project, a grassland creation scheme helping to reintroduce endangered animals and plants. You may also come across a big top festooned with lights – this is Giffords Circus, a “vintage village green circus” and travelling restaurant founded in Stroud that tours the south of England in the summer. The Alfresco Film Company hosts summer film nights at venues including Cotswold Airport, 12 miles away, screening classic movies in the shadow of a defunct British Airways Boeing 747.', 'The Cotswolds has, of course, long been a coveted place to live – the Romans settled here in AD43. Beautifully preserved Chedworth Roman Villa is now a National Trust site. The detailed mosaic floors, bath houses and “nymphaeum” (a shrine fed by spring) feel as though they were deserted by their original residents mere moments ago – and they’re still inhabited by Roman snails (Helix pomatia) brought here as a delicacy more than 1,800 years ago. Less well known but as eerily evocative is North Leigh Roman Villa, which is free to wander around (via a muddy track) and still has a beautifully intricate mosaic floor from the fourth century.', 'It’s possible to follow in the footsteps of the Romans by walking their ancient paths. The Fosse Way was once the longest Roman road in Britain, linking Exeter to Lincoln, and many sections have been swallowed up by modern highways. But fragments remain in the Cotswolds, such as a 25-mile stretch from Tetbury to Bath.', 'Of the 3,000 miles of public footpaths that wind through the Cotswolds the longest is the Cotswold Way. This national trail starts in Chipping Campden and winds its way south for 102 miles to end in Bath, a few miles to the south of the region. It’s split into 15 sections, but if I could only walk one, I’d pick the nine-mile route from Birdlip to Painswick. It passes beech woodlands, an iron-age hill fort and Cooper’s Hill, where, each May, a 5,000-strong crowd gathers at the dizzyingly steep slope to watch participants chase a wheel of double gloucester to the bottom during the annual cheese rolling event. However you get down the hill, you’ll end up in Painswick, often referred to as “Queen of the Cotswolds” for the beauty of its buildings and its 18th-century Rococo Garden, which puts on art trails and theatre productions in the summer.', 'North of my home valleys the villages take on a more Poshtershire honeyed hue, but there are still lesser-known delights to seek out at the top of the Cotswolds. Stow-on-the-Wold’s mellow stone streets are much photographed but the market town is also home to ancient yew trees, a Gypsy horse fair each May and three foodie pubs: the Porch House, which claims to be England’s oldest inn and serves a fantastic Sunday roast; the Old Butchers, which specialises in nose-to-tail cooking; and the Wild Rabbit, a posh eco-pub offering seasonal supper clubs.', 'Chipping Norton may now be best known for Clarkson and the A-listers escaping to Soho Farmhouse, but it’s also home to a literary festival (in April); indie bookstore Jaffé & Neale; the much-loved Chippy Lido, which hosts sunset swims; and a different kind of rock group – the Rollright Stones, 5,000-year-old monoliths said to be a king and his courtiers for ever petrified by a witch.', 'Camping is a good way to experience the wilder side of the Cotswolds. Abbey Home Farm offers back-to-basics meadow camping next to its organic farm shop, which sells homegrown vegetables and meat. At the T Barn there’s a cosy woodland cabin with hot tub as well as off-grid camping complete with fire pits. The Wildings is a calm, child-friendly campsite a minute’s stroll from Bourton-on-the-Water.
