It then took some time to extract the 23-year-old, who is the first Chinese driver in Formula One and in his rookie season.\\nZhou was safely removed and taken to the medical centre for examination. He was conscious and was released having been declared fit. \u201cI\u2019m OK, all clear. Halo saved me today. Thanks everyone for your kind messages!\u201d he posted on Twitter.\\nGeorge Russell was clipped by Pierre Gasly in the incident also involving Yuki Tsunoda, Esteban Ocon and Alex Albon and the Mercedes driver then collided with Zhou, turning his car over, causing it to hurtle at high-speed upside down across the gravel trap, with impact on the halo which protects the drivers\u2019 head, before hitting the barriers and sailing over them into the fence. Albon was taken to hospital for a check-up but was also pronounced unhurt.\\nThe scale and speed of the incident was horrific and Zhou was remarkably lucky to have escaped.\\nHe was upside down for a considerable distance and the tyre barriers barely slowed the car but instead launched it into the fencing.\\nThe accident occurred only hours after Roy Nissany and Dennis Hauger had a high\u2011speed crash in an F2 race in which Hauger landed on Nissany\u2019s car, the halo once again crucial in preventing serious injury. The main event was won by Ferrari\u2019s Carlos Sainz, from Sergio P\u00e9rez and Lewis Hamilton \u2013 and Sainz was full in his praise for the halo.\\n\u201cThe fact he came out of it is crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cI find it incredible that you can come out of it. It just shows, we sometimes criticise the FIA but you have to give it to them how much they have been helping us.\\n\u201cIf you see the crash in F2 and what happened with the halo, today they have saved probably two lives.\u201d\\nJust as the cars were returning to the pit with the race red-flagged after the accident a protest by the environmentalist group Just Stop Oil took place.

Thanks everyone for your kind messages! pic.twitter.com/OylxoJC4M0\\nWhen informed of the incident afterwards, Hamilton, who has expressed a commitment to environmental issues appeared to back them. When told it was by Just Stop Oil, he said: \u201cBig up those guys.\u201d\\nWhen asked to make his position clear, Hamilton added: \u201cI didn\u2019t know what the protesters were for, so I only just found out. I just said big up the protesters. I love that people are fighting for the planet. So we need more people like them.\u201d\\nHe later qualified that support via Instagram, posting: \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of the protests and while I\u2019ll always support those standing up for what they believe in, it must be done safely.

Its music is graceful, poised and smooth, but it is also an almost conceptual set of songs about the urgency of the climate crisis and the disorientation of living in a culture that still refuses to acknowledge it. According to its chief creator, the singer-songwriter and former actor Tamara Lindeman, many of its songs evoke what happens when \u201cthis veneer of \u2018everything will be OK\u2019 disappears\u201d. That moment of revelation is perfectly captured in one song I have played over and over again \u2013 which is simply called Loss, and finds Lindeman recalling a conversation: \u201cWhat was it last night she said? At some point you\u2019d have to live as if the truth was true.\u201d\\nAmid unprecedented temperatures, fires and the grim pantomime that will eventually end with the selection of our next prime minister, I suspect more people than ever would now understand those words as a matter of direct emotional experience. For millions of us, this summer\u2019s heat is synonymous with an anxiety that is now impossible to shake off, and a renewed awareness of the small transgressions and outright hypocrisies that are required to get through each day. We perform them because of something that Lindeman\u2019s lyrics consummately describe: that very human talent for just about averting our eyes from what is directly in front of us, so as to live a quiet life; and a political culture that just about keeps the \u201ceverything will be OK\u201d veneer in place.\\nThese are things evident across the planet, and the UK has its own grim versions of them. One of the two remaining Tory leadership candidates has pledged to retain the current de facto ban on onshore windfarms; the other wants to reconsider some of the key policies built into the government\u2019s milquetoast 2050 net zero target (the positions of Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, respectively). The Labour party has one big climate policy \u2013 its \u00a328bn-a-year climate investment pledge \u2013 but is still not putting global heating anywhere near the centre of its basic message, and is thereby failing to acquire much consent for action on it.\\nMeanwhile, for a certain kind of media voice, the past week has been all about raging against climate sceptics and deniers and their influence on politics, as if pointing out that they are mendacious and dangerous is an act of bravery. The former BBC presenter Andrew Marr provided a good example in a monologue broadcast on his new show on LBC: \u201cI for one have had enough of being told by pallid, shadowy, old businessmen and lazy ignorant hacks and sleazy lobbyists \u2013 who aren\u2019t real scientists, any of them \u2013 that the science is wrong and that what is happening isn\u2019t happening,\u201d he said. \u201cEnough!\u201d\\nThe key question of 2022 is not whether those people are wrong, both factually and morally: we know the answer to that. For the moment, I don\u2019t think many people need to be thinking very much about particular parties or politicians. What we surely need to focus on is the deep attachment to fossil fuels still locked into our economy and political system, and how to help the movements that definitely want to end it: Extinction Rebellion (XR), Insulate Britain, Just Stop Oil and the other forces that clearly understand the unspeakable gravity of the moment. This comes down to a question that still does not intrude on politics nearly enough: as these groups take the most direct kind of action, do you support them? And if \u2013 or, rather, as \u2013 the climate emergency deepens and the awful gap between politics and the sheer scale of what we are faced with only widens, what will you think if their actions take new, ever-more disruptive forms?\\nTo some extent, the way our media and politicians fend off the climate crisis accidentally confronts people with exactly those arguments. In one of our most regular national rituals, mainstream politics barely intrudes and instead, a protester fresh from some or other climate action is berated by Piers Morgan, Richard Madeley or one of the presenters from GB News or TalkRadio, and the only real options become clear: meaningful and radical action or nothing at all. An editorial last week in the Sun insisted that \u201cwe need a sober debate, free from the extremists\u2019 juvenile panic, on how we inch towards Net Zero in decades to come\u201d, which made panic look like much the more sensible option. In April, the Labour party demanded that the government take legal action to effectively ban climate protests that disrupt traffic and oil production. When he stood to be his party\u2019s leader, Keir Starmer took donations from a former boss of the RAC and AA, and the latter company-cum-lobby group\u2019s former chief financial officer. The people he apparently thinks should be locked up, by contrast, are motivated by a comparatively pure mission to confront the car industry and quickly finish the hydrocarbon era, and thereby avoid catastrophe. So who do you choose?\\nIn some cases \u2013 Occupy is a good example here \u2013 sustained support for protesters and activists has bumped up against their lack of a coherent agenda. But the modern climate movement is not like that. The basic position shared by the central handful of groups is clear enough: net zero by a much earlier date than 2050. XR and the people backing the climate and ecology bill \u2013 including such politicians as the Greens\u2019 Caroline Lucas and Labour\u2019s Clive Lewis \u2013 envisage that change being driven by citizens\u2019 assemblies, set up to decide how such an aim will be reached. In the context of Westminster politics, such ideas may seem so unlikely as to be barely worth considering. But remember: Brexit is a madcap, massively disruptive project that defies just about every element of political and economic sense, but was until recently the preserve of cranks and obsessives and only became a reality when David Cameron decided to bypass MPs and ask the rest of us to decide. Less than a decade after it decisively burst into the political foreground, moreover, we are locked into it for keeps, with the support of both main parties. By comparison, is trying to set an example to other countries by doing exactly what the climate demands really so fanciful?\\nActivism and protest often trigger a kneejerk suspicion that they will alienate people and kill whatever cause they advocate. But experience suggests the exact opposite: just as successive waves of social reformers, the suffragettes and the anti-apartheid movement were stubborn, daring and creative enough to make their demands irresistible, so the people now lying in roads and charging into airports and refineries have conveyed the urgency of climate breakdown more successfully than anyone in a suit. There is a very good reason for that: it is only well outside centres of power that you can find the answer to a question that power and politics are dodging more than ever \u2013 how to live as if the truth is actually true.\\nJohn Harris is a Guardian columnist\\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Australian actors have taken on roles such as Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), the Joker (Heath Ledger), Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth). A score of blockbusters (including the new Thor: Love and Thunder) have been filmed on our shores; however, George Miller\u2019s planned Justice League film got curtailed in 2008 when the government ruled that the project wasn\u2019t Australian enough to earn tax rebates. While superhero cinema might often feature Australian faces or locations, Australia itself has rarely been represented on screen.\\nThe most prominent role Australia as a nation has played in a superhero flick would still be in 1980\u2019s Superman II, where Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) sets ownership of Australia as his price for selling out Earth to the Kryptonian tyrant General Zod. It would take 25 films for Australia to officially make an appearance in the sprawling Marvel Cinematic Universe, as Angelina Jolie\u2019s secluded hideout in Eternals. The one possible predecessor to this would be the delightful (but non-canonical) Team Thor shorts, in which Thor takes a working holiday in Australia and flatshares with a put-upon IT professional called Darryl.\\nHowever, if we shift our attention to comics, it becomes a different story. Despite the action in the Marvel and DC Universes both being primarily US-based, there is a surprisingly long history of Australia appearing as the site of superheroic conflicts, terraformed, blown up and rebuilt. In my purely subjective opinion, here are the 10 greatest events to happen to Australia in Earth 616 (Marvel) and Earth-1 (DC).\\nJoe Simon and Jack Kirby\u2019s Captain America famously debuted in 1941 by socking Hitler on the jaw. For Simon and Kirby, two working-class Jews in New York, their patriotic hero could serve as agitprop to encourage a reluctant US to take action against Nazi Germany.\\nFor the vast majority of his publishing history, Cap is situated within the European Theatre of the second world war. A rare exception to this is 1944\u2019s Captain America Comics #36, which opens with the tale The Blood of Dr Necrosis. It is the earliest example I can find of Australia being depicted in what would later become the Marvel Universe.\\nThe story opens with Captain America and Bucky fighting side by side with an Australian battalion, when they get reports of mysterious cases of gangrene among wounded Australian soldiers. They fly to Brisbane to investigate and discover that the grotesque Dr Necrosis, who runs the blood bank, has been tainting the plasma supply. Of course our heroes defeat the Nazi spy, but you have to wonder how the Queensland Health Department\u2019s background checks didn\u2019t suspect there might be an issue giving a critical public service job to a guy named Dr Necrosis. (Maybe he was a National Party donor.)\\nIt is harder to establish the first on-panel depiction of Australia in the DC Universe. My favourite of these earliest examples has to be The Beast from the Stars, from 1958\u2019s The Adventures of Rex The Wonder Dog #39, written by John Broome and illustrated by Gil Kane.\\nRex, a White Shepherd, accompanies journalist Paul Henley on an assignment to Australia to investigate a strange bug-eyed monster that was caught in the bush. Rex serves as Henley\u2019s official photographer, with a camera hanging off his collar; he also happens to be the only being who can understand the alien astronaut Xtar\u2019s instructions on how to capture the monster. Rex finds a convenient apple tree and sets up a trail to lead the beast straight into Xtar\u2019s spaceship. Once he returns to the US, Rex is rewarded with pats and being told that he\u2019s the smartest dog in the universe.\\nPower Rangers is a superhero franchise that has deep Australian connections, despite being a hybrid of the US and Japanese kids TV markets: 1995\u2019s Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie is basically the genesis of Sydney\u2019s modern status as a global film-making hub, while the 2017 reboot was directed by Curtin University graduate Dean Israelite and stars Aussie Stranger Things star Dacre Montgomery.\\nMelbourne-based writer Tom Taylor scripted the first ever crossover between the Power Rangers and the DC Universe. Working with artist Stephen Byrne on 2017\u2019s Justice League/Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the pair united the two superteams and their respective villains Brainiac and Lord Zedd. The evil duo send out giant octopus monsters to major cities across the globe to divide and conquer the superheroes. One such monster finds its way to Victoria, where it starts the rampage at Flinders Street Station. Thankfully for Melburnian commuters, Batman and the Black Ranger arrive in the Mastodon Zord to save the day.\\nManifold, AKA Eden Fesi, has become the most prominent Australian hero in the modern Marvel Universe. An Aboriginal man from the Northern Territory, he was trained in his teleportation powers by X-Men ally Gateway and was recruited by Nick Fury to be part of his covert team working to regain control of the spy agency Shield from the fascist terror group Hydra. When writer Jonathan Hickman took over the Avengers franchise in 2012, Manifold was reintroduced as a key member of the team. He has also been a close ally of Black Panther, helping T\u2019Challa stop a civil war in Wakanda.\\nWhen The Babadook director Jennifer Kent was asked if she wanted to make a Marvel movie, she highlighted Manifold as the character she was most interested in exploring. Kent also nominated the star of her film The Nightingale, Baykali Ganambarr, as her choice to play the hero.\\nIn 1955, a team of international heroes inspired by Batman was formed, known as The Batmen of All Nations. This included Ranger, an Australian hero who adopted Ned Kelly iconography. In a creepy 2007 mystery written by Grant Morrison and illustrated by the brilliant JH Williams III, the Batmen of All Nations are reunited to investigate the murder of their original benefactor. The Dark Ranger falls victim to the murderer as well, leaving his sidekick Scout to become Australia\u2019s next Batman equivalent. In z #6, Scout \u2013 AKA Johnny Ridley, an Aboriginal tattoo artist from Melbourne \u2013 is formally inducted by The Dark Knight into his new team in a quasi-religious ceremony that sees him swear the same oath Batman and Robin made to fight against crime.\\nJonathan Hickman\u2019s run on The Avengers starts with biological bombs being fired at Earth from Mars. Each transforms the site they hit, terraforming the location by forcing billions of years of evolution to occur instantly. It was a profoundly weird experience to open up the latest adventure of Marvel\u2019s top superhero team to find out that my home town had essentially been destroyed.\\nAbout 10 issues later, The Avengers return to a bug-infested Perth. It was a truly uncanny feeling to see familiar Perth streets like St Georges Terrace overtaken with weird vines.\\nThe 2019 Suicide Squad series opens with a new fleet of nuclear submarines being proudly unveiled in Fremantle Harbour. The show is disrupted by The Revolutionaries, a team that could be described as Extinction Rebellion with superpowers. Bizarrely, writer Tom Taylor prophesised the Aukus deal that would be announced two years later by having The Revolutionaries hijack a nuclear submarine sold to Australia by the US.\\nSign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning\\nThis series (which is available as a graphic novel called Suicide Squad: Bad Blood), also saw Taylor and artist Bruno Redondo introduce Thylacine, a new Aboriginal anti-heroine for the DC Universe. They consulted with Aboriginal actor Shari Sebbens and Cleverman creator Ryan Griffen in developing the character.\\nIn the later stages of Chris Claremont\u2019s 17-year run writing the X-Men, he had the mutants leave the leafy grounds of Xavier\u2019s Institute for Gifted Youngsters for the remote outback town of Cooterman\u2019s Creek. The base debuted in Claremont and artist Marc Silvestri\u2019s Uncanny X-Men #229, as the mutant heroes fought off cybernetic mercenaries who were occupying the town. The X-Men would be based in Cooterman\u2019s Creek for around a year, during which they meet the aforementioned Gateway, who became their main means of transport from the NT to the rest of the world.\\nInvasion! was a big crossover event for DC Comics, published in 1989. Here, the alien race known as the Dominators put together an alliance of alien civilisations all fearful that Earth\u2019s superheroes will displace their power in the galaxy. They choose Australia to be their beachhead for the invasion, believing that the island continent has no superheroes to defend it.\\nIt is striking to see the future Spawn creator and Image Comics founder Todd McFarlane draw the destruction of Melbourne, which becomes the Alien Alliance\u2019s base of operations on Earth. All of Australia is quickly subjugated, becoming the example the Dominators use to try to blackmail the rest of the planet into giving up their superheroes.\\nWhat could possibly be a bigger event than all of Australia being invaded by aliens? Only the (former) Lord of Hell deciding to make Australia his first stop after throwing away his crown. In my favourite story from Neil Gaiman\u2019s The Sandman (and yes, I can already hear people complaining that Sandman isn\u2019t a superhero comic \u2013 except that the Justice League actually appear on panel in the first arc), the series\u2019 moody hero, Dream of the Endless, journeys into hell to free his lost love who has been unjustly imprisoned there for millennia. Expecting to have to face Lucifer in combat, Dream is instead given the keys by Lucifer, who is sick of having to rule over the damned. Throughout Seasons of Mists, Dream has to negotiate with delegations of demons, gods and angels, all trying to secure prime psychic real estate in hell.\\nIn the story\u2019s epilogue drawn by Mike Dringenberg, Lucifer (depicted as David Bowie), has buggered off to a beach in Perth. After a brief chat with an old bloke on the unfairness of life and how it contrasts with the physical beauty of the world, even Lucifer himself gives props to God, telling him \u201cThe sunsets are bloody marvellous, you old bastard.\u201d\\nKevin Chiat is a writer and academic from Perth.

There was criticism that public services had pre-emptively closed down \u2013 and praise for Prince Charles continuing to wear a suit and tie in the heat.\\nInside the newspaper, the columnist Stephen Robinson bemoaned how weather maps had dispensed with jolly symbols and instead used deep red colours to show high temperatures. He claimed the Met Office \u2013 in cahoots with the BBC \u2013 has become an \u201call-singing, all-dancing amen choir for the climate alarmist \u2018Blob\u2019\u201d.\\nHe said other parts of the world coped with extreme heat, adding: \u201cIn Africa, real men would wear shorts and safari jackets and hydrate by ordering another few beers.\u201d\\nThe paper\u2019s editorial went further and suggested the reaction was a sign of weakness in the national character: \u201cListening to apocalyptic climate change pundits and the BBC, you\u2019d think Britain was about to spontaneously combust.\u201d\\nBy Tuesday, after temperatures in the UK hit a record 40.3C, the same newspaper gravely described the \u201cnightmare of wildfires\u201d that had indeed combusted suburban homes of the type occupied by many of its readers.\\nThe extreme nature of this week\u2019s weather has been a reckoning for parts of the UK media, showing the extent to which public coverage around the climate crisis has changed in the last decade.\\n\u201cThings have changed massively,\u201d said Richard Black, a former BBC environment correspondent who wrote a book on the rise and fall of climate change sceptics in the UK. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any more outright climate denial, it\u2019s just not credible any more.\u201d\\nAlthough some newspapers still question the links between the climate crisis and individual extreme events, Black said it was harder for them to downplay extreme weather when its readers were watching footage of British homes burning down.\\n\u201cThere\u2019s an extent to which nobody can ignore evidence in front of your eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can argue one dramatic picture shouldn\u2019t make a difference but it does. It looks like California or Australia or the areas of the world that have been hit by bad wildfires.\u201d\\nIt wasn\u2019t always the case that British newspapers \u2013 and rightwing campaigners and media outlets allied with the Conservative party \u2013 were instinctively sceptical about climate science. David Cameron built his rebrand of the Tories around the issue and there appeared to be a cross-party political consensus on the need for action.\\nA key change took place in the late 2000s with the rise of a small group of climate sceptics including the former chancellor Nigel Lawson and his Global Warming Policy Foundation. The group, one of a number of opaque organisations including the Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance that share an office at 55 Tufton Street in Westminster, quickly found an audience in the national media for its message that the call for radical action was overblown. They seized on the Climategate leak and genuine scientific errors made around the handling of Himalayan temperature data to build a narrative that the threat of climate crisis was overstated.\\nDuring this period the BBC would often provide a platform to climate deniers in the name of impartiality and giving a hearing to both sides of a debate, something the broadcaster has since accepted was wrong.\\nOn Monday Extinction Rebellion protesters smashed windows at the London headquarters of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media company in protest against his outlets\u2019 environment coverage.\\nIn a sign of changing attitudes, journalists at the Times then fell over themselves to tweet about how they had reported on the link between the climate crisis and extreme heat.

This was because colonialism had \u201cestablished a model through which the air and lands of the global south have been \u2026 used as places to dump waste the global north does not want\u201d, the report says.\\nIt adds that similar inequalities are visible in the UK, where almost half of all of waste-burning incinerators are in areas with high populations of people of colour. In London, black people are more likely to breathe illegal levels of air pollution, and black people in England are nearly four times as likely as white people to have no access to outdoor space at home, it says.\\nYouGov polling alongside the report shows widespread ignorance of the racial divide in environmental impacts. of those polled, 35% believed that people of colour were no more likely than others to live close to a waste incinerator; 55% believed there was no difference in exposure to air pollution between white people and people of colour in London; and 47% believed there were no significant differences between ethnicity groups in access to green outdoor spaces.\\nProduced in collaboration with the race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust, the report traces the roots of the environmental emergency to colonialism, slavery and the plunder of resources from the global south. Greenpeace says it is making environmental justice a central pillar of its work.\\n\u201cWe argue that the outcomes of the environmental emergency cannot be understood without reference to the history of British and European colonialism, which set in motion a global model for racialised resource extraction from people of colour.\u201d\\nThe report\u2019s publication makes Greenpeace UK the latest big campaign group to link racial justice to the environment agenda. Pat Venditti, its executive director, described the issues as \u201ctwo sides of the same coin\u201d.\\n\u201cThis is why it\u2019s absolutely vital that, as a campaigning organisation, we help to shed light on the links between racism and environmental harm and make it a central pillar of our work,\u201d Venditti said. \u201cAs a predominantly white organisation located in the global north Greenpeace UK recognises that it still has a lot of learning to do. But we\u2019re pulling out all the stops to make sure we get it right in future.\u201d\\nMainstream green groups have \u201cnot done enough to recognise the links between systemic racism and climate change\u201d, says the report, in acknowledgment of long-held criticism of the environmental movement\u2019s understanding of the impact of racism.\\nIt says Greenpeace UK has \u201cwork to do to centre environmental justice\u201d in its campaigns and will do so \u201cthrough its relationships with impacted communities, other allies and the wider environmental and climate justice movements in the UK and around the world\u201d.\\nThe report is a key development in a journey begun by Greenpeace and many other institutions in 2020, when Black Lives Matter anti-racist demonstrations spread across the world after the murder in the US of the civilian George Floyd by a police officer.\\nAsad Rehman, the director of War On Want, an anti-poverty charity that campaigns on environmental justice, said he welcomed the report, \u201cespecially as many big NGOs historically ignored issues of race and intersectional justice\u201d.\\nRehman said: \u201cThey have been forced to address this because the broader climate justice movement is shifting the discourse and narrative. However, it\u2019s still baby steps. What we now need to see is that reflected in their policy demands, their campaigns and internally in their organisations.\u201d\\nThe report could be a resource for Greenpeace supporters, who are largely white, to help with understanding the racial context of the climate crisis. By drawing together examples of environmental racism in the UK and abroad, and showing the roles UK institutions have played in them, it aims to tell the environmental justice story in a way that audiences can relate to.\\nGreenpeace UK said it would also be launching two initiatives to support environmental and social justice groups. It will offer warehouse space to grassroots groups for the design and planning of campaigns, and create a fund \u201cto contribute to the initiatives of groups that advocate for social, racial and/or environmental justice\u201d.\\n\u201cFunds can help cover things like venue costs, equipment rentals, materials for actions, investigations or workshops, or setting up a community fridge, to name a few,\u201d Greenpeace UK said.\\nDr Halima Begum, the chief executive of the Runnymede Trust, said: \u201cThis report, by two leading organisations in their respective sectors, reminds the world of something that should be glaringly obvious \u2013 the climate crisis is also a racial crisis.\\n\u201cSpeaking as someone from one of the sacrifice zones identified in the report, whose father\u2019s village in Bangladesh remains underwater due to the increasing devastation wrought by climate change, this report confirms that we cannot overcome the environmental emergency faced by the entire planet without addressing patterns of global racial disparity.\u201d\\nNewham, in east London, has the largest minority-ethnic population of any local authority area in the UK, and it is one of the most deprived. It is also the most polluted.\\nOn average, Newham residents, 71% of whom are from ethnic minorities, are exposed to levels of particulate matter air pollution that is a third higher than World Health Organization limits, and one in seven are exposed to levels of nitrogen dioxide above the UK\u2019s limit for human health.\\nPoor air quality in the borough kills 96 residents a year, according to the local authority.\\n\u201cThere are days, particularly in a really smoggy day in autumn or winter, where it\u2019s really noticeable how heavy the air feels to breathe,\u201d said Liam O\u2019Hanrahan, an outdoor learning teacher at Newham primary school. \u201cYou do physically notice the pollution. And that\u2019s before you get on to the kind of journeys that children have to make coming to school, where I know they\u2019re walking down extremely busy roads.\u201d\\nYet it seems Newham can expect more traffic, not less. London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, has approved a \u00a31.2bn tunnel beneath the Thames, connecting Newham\u2019s Silvertown area with the Greenwich peninsula.\\nCampaigners say the tunnel will vastly increase congestion in the borough, and that the decision is at odds with Khan\u2019s efforts to show leadership on pollution and climate issues. Newham and Greenwich local authorities have called on Khan to ditch the scheme. Rokhsana Fiaz, Newham\u2019s mayor, said the project would undermine pollution and climate-change commitments.\\nDaniel Rodrigues, a builder who lives close to where the tunnel will emerge in Newham, says pollution in his local area is bearable \u2013 though he moved to the area with his family from west London to try to protect the health of his daughter, who suffers from a lung condition.\\nRodrigues and fellow campaigners believe the new tunnel will lead to thousands more cars in the area.\\nIn its latest report on racism and the environment, Greenpeace UK highlights the building of the Silvertown tunnel in Newham as a key example of environmental injustice in the UK. The group said it reflected a \u201cbigger picture \u2026 in which people of colour are disproportionately exposed to, and are particularly vulnerable to, air pollution\u201d.\\nKhan\u2019s office has said a tolling scheme on the tunnel and the existing Blackwall tunnel will manage demand and reduce congestion.\\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This project cannot be allowed to go ahead.\\n\u201cThe UK government must stop issuing any new fossil fuel licences and instead start planning for a managed phaseout of production, with a just transition for workers and communities.\u201d", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4678c1a7798f1c185e437d152fd01fdfc5c59a74/0_198_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Environmental activists protesting against the Jackdaw gasfield at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in June"]], "author": null, "date": "2022-07-26"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/jul/27/australia-politics-live-labor-climate-legislation-new-parliament-inflation-health-albanese-dutton-labor-coalition-qld-vic-nsw?page=with:block-62e08c0b8f081e9f3bd20e9b": {"title": "Marion Scrymgour calls for \u2018grog-free days\u2019 in Northern Territory towns \u2013 as it happened", "subtitle": null, "text": "Extinction Rebellion\u2019s \u2018zombie koala\u2019 protests outside Parliament House\\nWhile Chris Bowen introduces this bill, Extinction Rebellion is protesting outside, armed with a \u201czombie koala\u201d as the visual representation of what is at risk if climate policy doesn\u2019t go further.

At 20 I came out of the Royal Air Force, where I had failed my trade test to become a photographer (I was never good at being tested \u2013 I\u2019d even failed my 11-plus). I had a camera I\u2019d bought in Nairobi and never properly used, until by chance I got some work at the Observer in 1959.\\nTwo years later, the paper put me on a retainer for two days a week. I was earning very little money \u2013 15 guineas a week \u2013 but gaining a great deal of knowledge about England. I was sent to every corner, to cover coalmining strikes, byelections, anti-fascist rallies, nuclear protests. I learned how to follow the action. You knew one event came after the other. Sooner or later someone would get a bit too troublesome. You kept your eyes open, looking for the next move: an arrest, a fight. It became a natural way of thinking and working and moving. I was very fast on my legs in those days \u2013 as quick as a greyhound.\\nI had this drive to follow world events very closely. Although I\u2019m a poor reader and suffer from dyslexia, I took it upon myself \u2013 and still do \u2013 to buy the newspapers every day. I would scan every last word, looking for trouble at home and abroad. Then I would try to go there.\\nOver time I have come to see my photographs as a form of protest \u2013 in particular against the feast of evil that is war, because I have spent so much of my career documenting conflict. But that wasn\u2019t always the case. Photography is very exciting. If you think you\u2019ve got that picture \u2013 that you\u2019ve made the composition and your exposure is right \u2013 that is a reward in itself. The most rewarding thing for me has always been to see my name under a picture in print.\\nBut my work hasn\u2019t been easy mentally. You never know what effect seeing pain and suffering can have on you \u2013 but you just hope your images will have an effect on the public and spur people to demonstrate against the terrible things in the world. I don\u2019t take comfort in that because I wish the images didn\u2019t have to be taken, that we didn\u2019t need to be reminded of the occasional ugliness of man \u2013 and it is always men. Women don\u2019t cause these wars.\\nMy photograph of the man at Whitehall was for the Observer. I was sent to cover an anti-nuclear demonstration in Trafalgar Square during the Cuban missile crisis. The man had broken away from the crowd and made his way down Whitehall \u2013 the seat of power. The police threw a line out across the road very quickly, knowing other protesters would follow him.\\nLooking at the image now, I find it amusing. You see all these rather serious policemen, but one or two are slightly smirking. The man, who I never got to speak to, looks quite lonely sitting with his placard. In those days \u2013 here at least \u2013 there was still a civil approach to demonstration. Today the man might get his head cracked in or be sprayed with CS gas. Demonstrations around the world get violent: people are gassed and shot. The police are not particularly liked, and with good reason \u2013 think of the vigil for Sarah Everard in 2021 on Clapham Common and the way women were handcuffed and pressed to the ground. It\u2019s shameful.\\nI do question whether seeing what\u2019s going on helps or changes anything. But I still find it tragic that we don\u2019t see as many images of these events in the media any more. I worry we are being denied the truth. We need to keep paying attention and protesting for a better world.As told to Gabrielle Schwarz\\n\u201cIt was instantaneous,\u201d Hutchinson says of the day he carried an intoxicated rightwing protester to safety during a Black Lives Matter protest in London. \u201cI was thinking the worst of what could happen to him, but I was also thinking of the BLM movement being derailed by something like this tarnishing its name.\u201d Young BLM protesters \u201cwould have been vilified\u201d had they hurt Bryn Male, the retired transport police officer. Hutchinson didn\u2019t realise at the time that his act would be shared around the world. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of it at all. I\u2019m a bit older than a lot of the people that were there, I\u2019m not quite pulling my phone out and recording everything I see.\u201d Afterwards, however, when the picture was published, he realised: \u201cOh yeah, it\u2019s going to go everywhere.\u201d\\nIt was an odd experience, but not a bad one. \u201cIt felt really good,\u201d Hutchinson says. \u201cI was receiving messages from around the world, from thousands of people, saying that it gave them hope.\u201d He even received messages from people involved with the far right, saying his actions had made them think about their own beliefs and \u201cthe people they hang around with\u201d. He became a celebrity: an interview with GQ, a book deal and a meeting with Prince Harry all followed.\\nToday, Hutchinson runs his fitness and martial arts business, and does activism and community work with the organisation he founded with the friends who were with him that day, United to Change and Inspire. And he still likes the image. \u201cI\u2019m actually quite proud of it. When I\u2019m long gone, my grandchildren will be able to point to it and say, \u2018That\u2019s my grandad.\u2019\u201d FB\\nIn the 1990s, environmental protests swept Britain. Here, activists protest against the construction of the Newbury bypass in Berkshire \u2013 hundreds of acres of woodland were cleared for it. Activist Swampy, AKA Dan Hooper, became the face of the movement in early 1997 after police raided a protest camp in Devon. He was an object of fascination for the tabloids, who reported on everything from his love life to his possession of magic mushrooms and his relationship with his parents. \u201cIt made my life a little bit weird for a while,\u201d he remembers, so much so that he took to refusing all interviews and vanished from the public eye. Now, however, he believes \u201cwe kind of need the media a little bit\u201d. Back then, the whole country would follow the drama when Swampy was evicted from tunnels or trees, and environmental issues found a wider (if often hostile) audience as a result. \u201cNow I look back on it and think, wow, if it made any difference, then it was worth it.\u201d FB\\n\u201cThe people we put on pedestals should be inspirational, people to literally and figuratively look up to,\u201d Rhian Graham says. She is one of the four defendants who stood accused of criminal damage for their role in toppling a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol during an anti-racism protest on 7 June 2020.\\nThis wasn\u2019t the only statue to be targeted that summer. The murder of George Floyd had sparked a wave of anti-racist protests across the world and demonstrators frequently targeted monuments commemorating colonial figures. But this image had a particularly strong impact. As Graham recalls: \u201cIt was a moment of victory, of people saying: \u2018Colston and men like him do not represent Bristol today and do not deserve to be on a pedestal.\u2019\u201d\\nThe four were cleared of the charges by a jury earlier this year. Unused funds raised for the trial are being distributed to anti-racist charities in Bristol. \u201cTo have been found not guilty has given me faith in humanity again,\u201d Graham says. But the attorney general has since made the contentious decision to refer the case to the court of appeal for legal clarification. The new policing bill has a section that raises the maximum penalty for damaging a statue to 10 years in prison \u2013 a move Graham says \u201cilluminates our government\u2019s priorities and who the laws are designed to protect\u201d. GS\\nThe Greenham Common Women\u2019s Peace Camp, an anti-nuclear encampment that ran from 1981 to 2000, was the largest female-led protest movement since the suffragettes. The most famous event at the camp was Embrace the Base: a protest marking the first anniversary of Nato\u2019s decision to store nuclear missiles at the RAF airfield in Berkshire. On 12 and 13 December 1982, more than 30,000 women came together to hold hands and encircle the nine-mile perimeter fence of Greenham.\\n\u201cIt was a really powerful moment, because there were so many of us from all different walks of life,\u201d recalls Angie Zelter, an environmental and human rights campaigner who attended Embrace the Base. The fact that they were all women was important, Zelter says, because it allowed them \u201ca space to speak and act in their own way without being dominated by men, who tend to take the limelight in a mixed group. Women felt safe to engage in nonviolent direct action \u2013 they were able to cry freely, hold hands, show their vulnerability.\u201d\\nThere was a heavy police presence at Greenham Common, with frequent raids, evictions and arrests. At Embrace the Base, Zelter says, horses were brought in to try to disperse the women: \u201cI was quite frightened. At one point I was crying, but there were other women there who were used to horses, trying to calm them down.\u201d Today she continues to campaign against nuclear weapons: \u201cRegardless of what the so-called law says about protest, we have a right to protest and we will continue to protest.\u201d GS\\nFulvio Grimaldi was one of the few journalists present when British soldiers opened fire on protesters in Derry, killing 13 people. His image of panicked civilians carrying the body of teenager Jackie Duddy became the iconic image of the massacre. FB\\nLaunched in late 2018 by a small group of activists in the UK, Extinction Rebellion (XR) is now a global environmental movement with a presence in more than 80 cities across more than 33 countries. \u201cWe recognised that the political structures in place appeared to be incapable of doing what needed to be done,\u201d says co-founder Clare Farrell, who set up the XR art department and helped build its visual identity.\\nThe movement is decentralised, which means anybody can take part. The eye-catching spectacle of the Red Rebel Brigade was devised by a Bristol-based arts group for a protest in April 2019. With their bright red outfits, symbolising the blood of all living species, the silent troupe made a memorable impression \u2013 and continues to make appearances in rallies in different cities. XR is sometimes criticised \u2013 by figures on both the left and right \u2013 for promoting the strategy of disruptive protest. \u201cPeople like civil disobedience in the past \u2013 they don\u2019t really like it in the present,\u201d Farrell says. \u201cBut disruption is necessary because it\u2019s a way of getting the message across with much more urgency. If you are living in a society that is self-consciously self-terminating, then disrupting that is an extremely compassionate thing to do.\u201d GS\\nSeeking to \u201cfree art from oil\u201d, Liberate Tate is a collective that stages unsanctioned performance-cum-protests in gallery spaces. This photo depicts a work from 2011 titled Human Cost, in which a member of the collective lay naked on the floor of Tate Britain\u2019s Duveen Galleries and was covered in an oil-like substance. The group has been credited with pressuring the Tate to end its 26-year sponsorship by BP in 2017. GS\\n\u201cYou could literally feel the emotion in the air. It was a very heavy feeling,\u201d Patsy Stevenson says of the vigil on London\u2019s Clapham Common on 13 March 2021. Hundreds had gathered to mourn Sarah Everard, who had been abducted, raped and murdered by Metropolitan police officer Wayne Couzens. \u201cOften as women we\u2019re told to stay indoors when things like this happen. It was one of those moments where it was like, no, we don\u2019t want to stay silent any longer,\u201d Stevenson says.\\nThe Met claimed the gathering was in breach of Covid-19 restrictions and several participants were arrested. The image of Stevenson made an instant impact: \u201cProbably because of my bright red hair,\u201d she says. \u201cBut also the fact that I was at a vigil mourning the death of a woman by a police officer, and the police were arresting us.\u201d\\nThe high court has since found the police\u2019s attempt to block the vigil was unlawful. Stevenson is undertaking individual legal action against the Met and is not allowed to discuss the case. While the events of her arrest were traumatising \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m in therapy now because of it\u201d \u2013 Stevenson is grateful for the increased attention on combating violence against women. \u201cIt gave me some opportunities to change people\u2019s opinions and hopefully get more things done.\u201d GS\\nPeople in more than 600 cities across the world took to the streets on 15 February 2003 to express their opposition to the planned US-led invasion of Iraq. These demonstrations are said to be the largest coordinated protest event in history. This photograph of a sea of banners at the march in London captures the scale of the proceedings. Despite the groundswell of public opposition, the war in Iraq began just over a month later. GS\\n\u201cThat day will never leave me,\u201d says Annie Pilkington-Bernier, seen here in a pale bucket hat and glasses, aged 24. \u201cI\u2019d been on many demonstrations before that, and I still believe it was one of the most defining marches I\u2019ve been on.\u201d Roughly 20,000 people marched from Fordham Park in south London to Hyde Park on 2 March 1981, to protest against the lack of response among politicians and journalists to the deaths of 13 (later 14) young black people in the New Cross fire in January that year. \u201cThe National Front was so prominent at that time,\u201d Pilkington-Bernier says, \u201cand it felt like the black community was under attack.\u201d\\nInitially, police tried to stop marchers from crossing the river, though eventually they made their way across Blackfriars Bridge and along Fleet Street. Much of the protesters\u2019 anger was towards British newspapers. \u201cWe wanted to shame the press,\u201d Pilkington-Bernier says. \u201cIt felt like the only time the black community made the newspapers was crime.\u201d\\nWriter and photographer Vron Ware was there in solidarity and also to bear witness, \u201cboth to the grief, rage and dignity of the assembly, but also to the police tactics\u201d. Ware had covered many fascist demonstrations in the late 70s and for her the way far-right protesters were treated, \u201cmarching wherever they liked\u201d, was in stark contrast to the heavy-handed approach of the Metropolitan police towards the black protesters. Earlier this year, Pilkington-Bernier recognised herself in the picture at an exhibition that she visited with her niece. \u201cWhen we saw it, we were both so happy,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so important these images are seen now \u2013 the next generation, with the Black Lives Matter movement, are walking in our footsteps.\u201d FB\\nIn the late 70s, Jayaben Desai (second from right) led a workers\u2019 strike at the Grunwick Film Processing factory in Willesden, advocating for better working conditions. Most of the workers, including Desai, were Ugandan Asian women who had been expelled by Idi Amin before settling in the UK. Their strike gained wide support: postal workers refused to take mail to and from the factory, and even Arthur Scargill joined the picket line. The writer Amrit Wilson, who covered the protest, remembers Desai as \u201cvery persuasive \u2026 She also understood patriarchy, which was central to the strike.\u201d FB\\nThis article was amended on 4 July 2022. The environment activist Dan Hooper \u2013 \u201cSwampy\u201d \u2013 became a household name due to a 1997 protest in Devon, not the 1996 Newbury bypass protest, as an earlier version said.\\nThese images are a snapshot of a rich global history of resistance.

The company could meet those targets by cutting emissions or buying carbon credits to offset its pollution.\\nOpponents said the condition covered only a fraction of the total pollution expected from the extension as the vast bulk would be \u201cscope three\u201d emissions released after the gas was exported and burned overseas.\\nWoodside has estimated the development\u2019s scope three emissions would be about 80m tonnes a year. Climate campaigners said it suggested it could be responsible for more than 4bn tonnes of additional carbon dioxide over 50 years \u2013 more than eight times Australia\u2019s annual emissions.\\nThe head of clean transitions at Greenpeace Australia Pacific, Jess Panegyres, said the North West Shelf extension would undermine Australia\u2019s emissions reduction efforts and add to a worsening climate crisis if allowed to go ahead.\\nShe said the EPA recommendation could lead to Woodside tapping a long-promised new gas field, Browse, off the WA coast, and showed \u201chow fossil fuel companies can exploit our weak environmental laws in their own self-interest\u201d.\\n\u201cBoth the UN and International Energy Agency have been very clear that there can be no new gas developments to limit global warming to 1.5C, but Woodside continues to aggressively expand its operations, even with the global gas market set to shrink as the world switches to cleaner, safer renewables,\u201d Panegyres said. \u201cThis dangerous company does not have Australia\u2019s economic or environmental best interests at heart.\u201d\\nWoodside said the release of the EPA recommendations marked an important step in the North West Shelf extension. Its executive vice-president, Fiona Hick, said the company would carefully consider the conditions proposed by the EPA.\\n\u201cAt a time of heightened concern around energy security, the North West Shelf project has an important role to play in delivering natural gas to local and international customers, providing energy that can support their decarbonisation commitments,\u201d she said.\\nWoodside recently dramatically expanded its fossil fuel footprint by merging its petroleum assets with those of the global miner BHP, a step that made it one of the world\u2019s Top 10 oil and gas companies. It is proposing several new developments in Western Australia, including a $16bn development of the untapped Scarbrough gas field.\\nIt has been criticised for failing to explain how it would meet what it has described as its aspiration to reach net zero emissions by 2050. At an annual general meeting in May, 48.97% of shareholders voted against the company\u2019s climate report.\\nFederal government emissions data shows the North West Shelf development emitted more than 6.7m tonnes of carbon dioxide in the 2020-21 calendar year, more than any other Australian industrial facility.\\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\\nThe executive director of the Conservation Council of Western Australia, Maggie Wood, said the plant was one of the oldest and least efficient gas processing plants in the country, and the plant\u2019s extension could undermine efforts to reach net zero emissions by 2050.\\nShe said it would continue Western Australia\u2019s role as the laggard state on climate. Its emissions have increased 20% since 2005, largely due to the rise of a large liquefied natural gas export industry.\\n\u201cExtending the life of this giant fossil fuel facility is not going to reverse the trend that has made WA the worst performing state on climate action in the country. We not only can do better, we must do better,\u201d she said.\\nThe EPA\u2019s recommendations included additional conditions to prevent damage to Murujuga rock art on the Burrup Peninsula, some of which is believed to date back nearly 50,000 years.

Here\u2019s how to tell the difference and protect yourself, your friends and family \u2013 and your pets\\nThe train tracks are on fire and the NHS may declare a level 4 heat emergency (there\u2019s no level 5). This is a summer of unprecedented temperatures, with more, and worse, to come. \u201cThe world is undoubtedly experiencing more extreme heating,\u201d says Martin Siegert of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change, highlighting \u201cliterally unbearable\u201d temperatures in India and Pakistan this year. \u201cWe are now, on average, 1.2C (2.2F) warmer than we should be because of our emissions. This means that things, sadly, will get worse.\u201d An extra 0.3C (0.5F) is \u201cunavoidable\u201d, meaning, Siegert says, \u201cExtreme heating episodes will continue to increase in frequency and severity. Unless we deliver net zero by mid-century, temperatures will rise well above the 1.5C (2.7F) level, with terrible consequences for climate heating in ways we have yet to witness fully.\u201d\\nThe only solution is to take action, using our votes and voices to press politicians to reduce emissions, urgently. Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and many other charities have practical suggestions on how you can get involved. But right now we, our parents, grandparents, children and even pets are all at risk of heat exhaustion and, worse, heatstroke. What are the warning signs? What can you do to prevent it and treat it, and when do you need urgent medical help?\\nIn heatstroke, the brain loses the ability to regulate body temperature, potentially leading to a cascade of damage to the liver, kidneys, muscles and particularly the heart. It can develop rapidly, with little warning, and can be fatal. But before you reach the danger zone of heatstroke, most adults will experience symptoms of heat exhaustion. \u201cHeatstroke is an emergency; heat exhaustion is not normally so,\u201d says Dr Lynn Thomas, medical director of St John Ambulance.\\nIt is a good idea to look at reliable symptom guides for heat exhaustion and heatstroke online, but in essence, heat exhaustion is that unwell feeling most of us have experienced at some point in very hot weather. \u201cYou may notice dizziness or being slightly confused, headaches, cramps; you\u2019d be sweating, cool skin, feeling sick, have a faster breathing rate and quicker heart rate,\u201d says Dafydd Beech, of the Red Cross National Community Education Team.\\nIn contrast, a person suffering from heatstroke may still have dizziness, headache and discomfort, but crucially, their skin will become hot, flushed and dry. \u201cThe body is losing its ability to sweat,\u201d says Thomas. \u201cIt can\u2019t lose any of that heat and it just keeps getting hotter and hotter. That can cause people to become quite confused. They can become unconscious, or have seizures and fits.\u201d This is the danger zone: \u201cIf somebody is not improving with water and being cooled down; if they\u2019re not sweating, even though it\u2019s really hot; if they\u2019re not managing to keep water down or drink water; if they have a temperature above 40C (104F) or they become unresponsive \u2013 please ring 999 no matter how busy it is,\u201d says Thomas. She suggests using speakerphone. \u201cUnfortunately, heatstroke could lead to somebody having a cardiac arrest. Hopefully you won\u2019t get to that point, but if you do, the call handler will talk you through everything you need to do.\u201d\\nIt is trickier, of course, to recognise the symptoms in yourself, especially when one of them is confusion. \u201cThere is absolutely an increased risk of people developing heat exhaustion and heatstroke if they live alone,\u201d says Thomas. \u201cYou may not notice you\u2019re feeling a bit confused, because how would you know?\u201d Beech advises to look out for any sense that \u201cthings start to feel worse, like: \u2018Something\u2019s not right here.\u2019\u201d\\nIn addition to the basic advice to stay in the coolest part of your home, and avoid exertion, Thomas\u2019s advice is to stay hydrated, \u201cand keep an eye on how often you go to the bathroom: urine should be light-straw-coloured\u201d. It is also important to be aware of the possible effects of any medication you are taking: \u201cSome antidepressants can reduce the ability to manage high temperatures or reduce your ability to sweat,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cEnsure that you\u2019ve got a method of calling on help if you need to do so,\u201d adds Beech. \u201cHave your phone near you.\u201d\\nFirst aid for people afflicted by heat exhaustion and heatstroke is mainly common sense: move the person to a cool place, give them water to drink (this may not be possible for heatstroke sufferers), and try to cool the skin. Thomas suggests \u201ca sponge or spray or ice packs; pour some water on the skin because that helps evaporation.\u201d For more serious cases, Beech suggests \u201cwrapping the person in cold, damper clothes\u201d. It is important not to try to cool a heat exhaustion sufferer very rapidly, which can lead to shock. \u201cWe sometimes hear about throwing the person into cold baths: you shouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d says Beech. The aim is \u201cslowly and steadily cooling the person down\u201d.\\nThe symptoms of heat exhaustion and heatstroke are the same for older adults, but they can be more vulnerable to dehydration, and may lose the urge to drink, which can increase the risks of heat-related illness. \u201cThe worry in elderly people is that they don\u2019t always recognise some of the signs,\u201d says Thomas. \u201cPlease check on your elderly relatives and neighbours way more frequently than you would normally; try to get them to stay inside and keep the curtains closed.\u201d It can be difficult, she says, to persuade dementia sufferers in particular to drink. \u201cMaybe put some water next to them with some ice in it; check they are drinking it. Tea is fine, thank goodness.\u201d\\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult with children, because they love being outside and they won\u2019t necessarily say: \u2018I need to go inside because I\u2019m hot.\u2019 So, make sure they are going to the loo regularly and having lots to drink,\u201d says Thomas. Symptoms of heat exhaustion and heatstroke are much the same in children as they are in adults, but note that when babies are suffering from heat exhaustion, often they \u201cget sleepier and don\u2019t interact as much\u201d.\\nTo keep babies cool, \u201cstay indoors or go out early\u201d, says Claire Maguire, a National Childbirth Trust post-natal practitioner. When you do go out, avoid clipping a muslin to the buggy or pram for shade: \u201cResearch says this can cause the inside of the pram to heat up and cause the overheating you were trying to prevent in the first place.\u201d Maguire recommends getting familiar with your baby\u2019s normal temperature (test on the back of the neck or the chest, not the extremities, which are cooler). \u201cThat way you know when they\u2019re too hot.\u201d\\nInfant safe sleep guidelines recommend bedrooms should be at 16-20C (61-68F): tough in this weather. Maguire\u2019s top tip is to three-quarters fill a two-litre bottle of water, freeze it, cut the plastic away, then stand it upright in a large roasting tin in front of a fan for half an hour or so before using a room. \u201cNever point a fan directly at a baby,\u201d says Maguire; they struggle to adapt to changes in temperature.\\nMaintaining hydration is vital, too. \u201cBabies are very vulnerable to dehydration because of their volume-to-surface-area ratio: if they get dehydrated it can affect their health much more quickly than someone larger,\u201d says Maguire. Breastfed babies may want to feed more often, she says; formula-fed babies can have small quantities of water regularly in a \u201cfree-flow sippy cup\u201d (boiled and cooled if they are under six months). Keep a tally of wet nappies: \u201cIf you have an older baby, you\u2019re probably used to the frequency of their wet nappies,\u201d says Maguire. \u201cIf you have a much younger baby and you\u2019re not quite sure what the rhythm is, it\u2019s around six nappies a day.\u201d If you\u2019re in any doubt at all, Maguire says, call NHS 111, and the free NCT support line (0300 330 0700) can give individual advice on summer feeding. The Red Cross also has a free baby and child first aid app.\\nOur furry housemates are also vulnerable to heat-related illness, says Dr Karen Humm, an emergency and critical care clinician at the Royal Veterinary College. Those that are overweight, those with thick fur designed for cold temperatures or flat-faced (brachycephalic) dogs such as pugs and bulldogs are even more at risk. \u201cDogs don\u2019t sweat, really,\u201d Humm says. \u201cSo if they can\u2019t pant effectively, they can\u2019t lose heat effectively.\u201d\\nThe warning signs that your dog may be dangerously overheating, Humm says, are \u201cnon-specific and that\u2019s why it\u2019s hard\u201d. Panting excessively or more noisily than usual is a key warning sign. Chris Wilson, a small-animal vet based in London, says dogs can also seem \u201crestless, or listless and out of sorts\u201d. More severely heat-affected dogs can drool, or suffer vomiting or diarrhoea, and at worst, collapse and suffer seizures.\\nIt is important, both agree, to act fast, well before this happens. Once an animal suffers heat-induced enzyme damage, this can be irreversible, even leading to multi-organ failure and death. \u201cIf you\u2019re not sure and they don\u2019t seem quite right, ring the vet. If they\u2019re breathing noisily, definitely ring the vet. If they are uncoordinated, stumbling, if they appear a little drunk or difficult to rouse or have collapsed, go straight to the vet \u2013 ring them when you\u2019re on the way,\u201d says Humm. \u201cThe emphasis is on stopping them from reaching that stage,\u201d agrees Wilson.\\nPrevention is best. \u201cKeep them shaded, keep them calm, offer them water,\u201d recommends Humm. You can cool dogs with water applied to the skin, although Wilson warns that if you use a wet towel, it\u2019s important to replace it regularly: \u201cThey can dry out really fast and end up insulating the dog further.\u201d Dog behaviourist Louise Glazebrook says some dogs enjoy a paddling pool, or cubes of frozen bone broth to play with or chew on. \u201cPut fans on, leave cold water with ice packs underneath, give access to cool, tiled surfaces and give cooling snacks, such as hard-boiled eggs or carrots from the fridge.\u201d Clip hairy dogs short, she advises: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how they look: they need their belly and chest plate area to be clipped very short to allow their body to make contact with cool surfaces.\u201d\\nPeople now mainly know not to leave dogs in hot cars, Humm says, although it does still happen.\\nThe next key message to get across is that on very hot days, it is vital only to walk dogs extremely early in the morning or late at night, or even not at all. \u201cThere\u2019s a misconception that an animal won\u2019t go for a walk if it\u2019s bad for them, and it\u2019s just not true,\u201d says Humm. In a recent study, she says, three-quarters of heat-related illness cases were brought on by exercise. \u201cIf in doubt, leave your dog at home to rest and be in peace,\u201d says Glazebrook, who notes that dogs\u2019 tolerance of touch, petting and being handled is likely to decline in the heat, potentially leading to irritability. \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t want to be touched. It\u2019s even worse for them \u2013 they have fur coats on!\u201d\\nBy contrast, cats rarely suffer heat-related illness unless they are trapped or without access to water. \u201cThey\u2019re evolutionarily from much hotter places,\u201d says Humm. \u201cCats are much more sensible than dogs,\u201d adds Wilson. \u201cThey are quite good at regulating their temperature behaviourally.\u201d They are, however, \u201cnotoriously bad drinkers. So leaving taps running, leaving glasses of water around, or some cats like to lick condensation off frozen bottles of water \u2013 all these are things you can do to make sure they\u2019re getting enough fluids.\u201d\\nSpare a thought, too, for rabbits in hutches in hot sunny places, Wilson says: \u201cPeople forget about them at this time of year. Keep them in the shade, in cooler areas, make sure they have access to water and move them inside if you can get it cooler indoors.\u201d", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c26b690acb61754efa5645b1e58d3ef36349f211/120_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Keep hydrated, but if you are not improving with water or struggling to keep it down, it may be time to dial 999."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98da83eb6c765d6ffa1c80c7f6e82889996994bd/0_192_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Keep drinking water, and keep an eye on how often you\u2019re going to the toilet."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e118e4b1f7748cc5a299efd82295c0a4037724bc/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Often, children won\u2019t tell you that they want to cool down indoors."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03ff04b1c3ad3412190e02ceab9d1a44bbddef77/0_299_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Clip hairy dogs short, give them cold treats, and spare them the walks."]], "author": ["Emma Beddington"], "date": null}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/26/there-is-an-alternative-to-disruptive-climate-protest": {"title": "There is an alternative to disruptive climate protest", "subtitle": null, "text": "Prof Rupert Read believes a moderate flank of activists who can bring people together is the way forward, while Cllr John Dearing urges people to get elected to local councils to make a difference.

I\u2019m proud to have helped launch Extinction Rebellion (XR), which, along with Greta Thunberg, most facilitated that breakout. But does disruptive protest remain the only way forward?\\nHarris appears to suppose that the only alternatives are either to back the radical flank or to be, at best, timid incrementalists. But the emerging moderate-flank strategy supposes something different: that the most effective thing to do now \u2013 while not shying away from how grim things are \u2013 is to meet people where they are and bring the majority with us. The radical flank is not capable of doing this. It (we) briefly did in April-May 2019, but such wonderful moments are rare.

If, however, we take advantage of the radical flank\u2019s achievements and facilitate a much larger cohort to march through the window we opened, then even now, we might win. \u201cWinning\u201d will not be a smooth transition; it\u2019s way too late for that. Winning now will be avoiding an uncontrolled civilisational collapse.\\nWhat is such a moderate flank looking like? It\u2019s to be found in diverse post-XR places such as Wild Card (campaigning to rewild the UK), Purpose Disruptors (advertisers turning their \u201cdark\u201d arts to the purpose of good), Lawyers For Net Zero, and the emerging network of Climate Emergency Centres. This seems to be our best way forward.Prof Rupert ReadRockland St Mary, Norfolk\\nJohn Harris is right to support direct climate action, but there is a further option: to get elected as a local councillor and make climate-friendly policies. Central government has responsibility for national climate policies, but there is scope for local councils to take more progressive action.\\nDespite financial constraints, local authorities have the ability to raise energy standards of new council-owned buildings, provide safe cycling and walking, ensure effective waste recycling, increase numbers of electric vehicle charging points, manage open spaces for biodiversity and carbon sequestration, lead the way in natural flood management, and more. They can bid for government funds for retrofitting homes and decarbonising public buildings, promote local investment in renewable energy and, crucially, engage with the public and businesses about what the climate crisis demands.\\nThe public is far more supportive of local climate actions than the media gives it credit for. Many will vote for candidates who present reasoned and sensible arguments for progressive policies, even if they vote for a different party at general elections.

Campaigners now have six weeks to decide whether to appeal against the decision.\\nPlanning permission was seen as a key hurdle for the project which remains subject to a further final investment decision, expected next year. It is hoped the plant can generate enough power for six million homes.\\nThe approval process for Sizewell C has so far included four rounds of public consultation which began in 2012 and has involved more than 10,000 East Suffolk residents.\\nThe Planning Inspectorate rejected the scheme because of concerns over the plant\u2019s impact on protected species and habitats, and the long-term water supply at the site.\\nEDF worked with Chinese state-backed nuclear specialist CGN on the first phase of the project.
