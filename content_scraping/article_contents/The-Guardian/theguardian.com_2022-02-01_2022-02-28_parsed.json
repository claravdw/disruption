There\u2019s no justification for these developments, which will see the oil in them exported. They won\u2019t lower bills or contribute to UK energy security. All they\u2019ll do is increase industry profits.\u201d\\nThe UK hosted the Cop26 UN climate summit last November, and will continue to direct international climate efforts this year as president of the UN negotiations. Deben made it clear that allowing new oil and gas extraction would have a \u201cmaterial\u201d impact on the UK\u2019s ability to encourage other countries to improve their climate targets.\\n\u201cContinuing to allow extraction may weaken UK diplomacy to encourage other countries to adapt ambitious climate policies. It is also important on a domestic state for their to be a perception that government policy is fully aligned with net zero, rather than being undermined by questions such as seen over the last year with the proposed coal mine in Cumbria and the Cambo oilfield,\u201d he wrote.\\nCaroline Lucas, the Green party MP, warned of the impact on the UK\u2019s attempts to bolster the achievements of Cop26. \u201cNew North Sea oil and gas developments send out totally the wrong signals both to UK businesses and consumers and the wider world,\u201d she said.\\n\u201cThe UK Cop president, Alok Sharma, is being cut off at the knees in his diplomatic efforts to keep [the global heating limit of] 1.5C alive \u2013 the key objective of the Glasgow climate pact. These licences don\u2019t make climate sense, they don\u2019t make diplomatic sense and they don\u2019t make financial sense, and no amount of so-called climate compatibility tests will change that.\u201d\\nHowever, the committee\u2019s advice that climate tests should be applied to licences that have already been issued, such as that to the Cambo oilfield, was welcomed. Danny Gross, campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cIt\u2019s reassuring that the government\u2019s plan to apply climate tests only to new licensing rounds is totally wrong in the committee\u2019s view. This loophole would allow dozens of carbon-intensive projects that have already been licensed, but not yet approved, to escape these tests.\u201d\\nThe government is consulting on a \u201cclimate checkpoint\u201d that would require any new oil and gas licences to pass a series of tests on their environmental impact. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, is expected to review at least six applications for new drilling licences in the North Sea this year, after a similar number were approved last year.\\nA spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cThere will continue to be ongoing demand for oil and gas over the coming decades as we transition to cleaner and cheaper forms of energy generated in this country. Turning off North Sea gas overnight would put energy security, British jobs and industries at risk and we would be more dependent on foreign imports. We welcome the committee\u2019s acknowledgment that carbon budgets can still be met if new oil and gas fields are developed in the UK.\u201d\\nThe committee also emphasised the role of insulation and renewable energy in cutting energy bills. Scrapped housebuilding regulations would have knocked about \u00a340 off energy bills, and if the 2030 target for offshore wind had been brought forward sooner, consumers would be \u00a3100 a year better off.\\nRosie Rogers, head of oil and gas transition for Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cAnyone who\u2019s read this advice and thinks the North Sea\u2019s future lies in oil and gas is utterly deluded, because it will take decades and won\u2019t ease energy bills. What we need to tackle bills and climate change is home insulation, heat pumps, electric vehicles and renewable power.\u201d\\nShe added: \u201cThe future of the North Sea is in renewables.

A useful counter-argument to calls for a windfall tax? Not so, Looney told the Guardian.\\n\u201cBP\u2019s historic links in the UK give us a foundation here,\u201d Looney said. \u201cBut the real reason we will focus on the UK is the opportunity: the wind resources here are among the best in the world. The UK is also blessed with a society and an economy which wants to transition. It\u2019s a good place to invest and it\u2019s a place that we know.\u201d\\nBP has spent about $3.2bn on clean energy since 2016, and $84bn on oil and gas exploration and development over the same period, according to equity analysts at Bernstein. But in a little over two years the company\u2019s renewable energy development pipeline has grown from 6GW in 2019 to 24.5GW thanks in large part to an aggressive entrance into the offshore wind industry.\\nBP set a record bid to clinch the rights to develop two offshore windfarms off the west coast of the UK last year, and recently won the right to develop more than 5GW of offshore wind power capacity off the Scottish coast.\\nStill, investors and climate activists have raised concern that the plans risk falling short of expectations from both sets of perspectives.\\nMark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, an activist investor, said the increased spending on low-carbon technologies \u201csounds promising, compared to today\u201d \u2013 in which 88% of BP\u2019s spending is directed towards fossil fuels \u2013 but it would still be far from enough to reduce emissions in line with the levels set out by the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\\nBP will nudge higher the reduction targets for the carbon emissions from the fossil fuels that it sells, or \u2018scope 3 emissions\u2019, from a modest cut of 15% by 2030 to between 15 and 20%. But this target relates to the carbon intensity of the energy it sells rather than the absolute emissions its fossil fuels create, van Baal said.\\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned, BP did not change its expectation that its level of total emissions will grow out to 2030,\u201d he added. \u201cAchieving Paris calls for a reduction of energy-related emissions of 45% according to the IPCC. They are still exacerbating the climate crisis by increasing CO2-emissions.\u201d\\nThe plan may also falter if BP struggles to convince investors that more low-carbon spending will lead to greater earnings for the FTSE 100 company. Its rival Shell is fighting calls from US hedge fund Third Point to break up into separate renewables and oil and gas businesses.\\n\u201cBP\u2019s been more aggressive than some of its peers when it comes to clean energy,\u201d said Laura Hoy, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, \u201cwhich could be a huge advantage if all goes to plan. However, it could also prove to be somewhat of a money pit if BP doesn\u2019t get it right.\u201d\\nIn return for spending half of its annual budget on its \u201cenergy transition\u201d businesses by the end of the decade BP expects to generate earnings of $9bn to $10bn a year by 2030, driven by five areas: bioenergy, convenience, electric vehicle charging, renewable energy and hydrogen.\\nBut there is no guarantee that BP will be able to wring enough profit from its new ventures to meet its targets. Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Capital, noted that BP\u2019s earnings from renewables fell from $1.6bn to $1bn between 2016 and 2021, \u201cfalling far short\u201d of the $2.1bn target initially set out for 2021.\\n\\nGreenwashing\u00a0is a form of marketing spin, in which companies persuade the public that their products, aims and policies are environmentally friendly. The term was coined by environmentalist Jay Westerveld in 1986 to refer to the corporate practice of making sustainability claims to cover a questionable environmental record.\\nAn\u00a0absolute greenhouse gas emissions target\u00a0aims to reduce overall climate pollution by a specific amount.\\nA\u00a0net-zero goal\u00a0is meant to offset all greenhouse gas emissions by\u00a0 capturing them, planting trees to absorb them, or paying for the development of cleaner energy.\\nAn\u00a0intensity reduction\u00a0seeks to cut the rate of planet-heating emissions that accompanies each unit of energy produced.\\n\u201cBP\u2019s wading into uncharted waters,\u201d Hoy said. \u201cThe profitability of these new businesses is unknown and there\u2019s a chance they won\u2019t make up for lost oil and gas cashflow given up in the transition.\u201d\\nCharlie Kronick, an analyst at Greenpeace UK, said that although there is \u201cno doubt that BP now has the most ambitious plans of any of the oil giants to pivot away from climate-wrecking fossil fuels as their core business\u201d the company was \u201cthe best of a bad bunch\u201d.\\n\u201cIt should be clear by now that we can\u2019t wait to solve this problem one oil company at a time,\u201d he said.

Here\u2019s a look at the Australian cases likely to make headlines this year\\nIn March 2021, a 16-year-old student and an octogenarian nun walked into the federal court in Melbourne for the hearing of a defining case in Australian climate litigation.\\nThe lawsuit brought by Anj Sharma, along with seven other teenagers, and Sister Brigid Arthur, is part of a growing trend among climate activists and environment organisations raising climate issues in the courtroom, amid a lack of action by the federal government.\\nIt is also consistent with a trend around the globe, with high-profile cases internationally against the likes of oil company Shell and the Dutch government.\\nAustralia now sits second on a climate litigation league table, behind only the United States.\\nAs the legal year begins, Guardian Australia outlines the major climate cases likely to make headlines in the months ahead.\\nEnvironment Minister v Sharma\n  The devastating impact of the impending climate crisis \u201cwill largely be inflicted by the inaction of this generation of adults, in what might fairly be described as the greatest inter-generational injustice ever inflicted,\u201d wrote Justice Mordecai Bromberg last May. With that hard-hitting truth, the federal court judge held that the environment minister, Sussan Ley, owed Australian children a duty of care to mitigate the impact of climate change, which was relevant as she considered approving a major coal mine expansion. Sharma, the lawsuit brought by Anj Sharma, seven other teenagers, and Sister Brigid Arthur, is the most seismic climate judgment in Australia to date.\\nUnsurprisingly, the environment minister appealed. While the first-instance case focused on the application of orthodox legal principles to a changing world, the federal government upped the stakes in the full federal court last October, arguing that the political nature of the case made it unsuited for judicial resolution.\\nThe decision is due soon; whatever the outcome, it is likely destined for the high court. Sharma is immensely significant because, grounded in common law negligence rather than administrative law, it cannot be easily overwritten by legislation. If the case holds on appeal, expect similar challenges \u2013 both to government decision-making and private sector emitters.\\nPabai v Commonwealth\\nSimilar issues are being argued in Pabai, on an even larger scale, in a case brought by two Torres Strait Islanders. They argue that the federal government as a whole is acting negligently in failing to save the Torres Strait Islands from rising sea levels. The plaintiffs point to the Torres Strait treaty (with Papua New Guinea), native title law and other government initiatives in the region to underscore the duty of care they believe is owed. Failure to act, the pair\u2019s lawyers argue, \u201cwill have severe impacts on Torres Strait Islanders, including, injury, disease, and death, rendering some of the islands uninhabitable and displacing Torres Strait Islanders, causing them to become climate refugees\u201d.\\nThe federal court case is listed for a case management conference in March. There has been some discussion about taking evidence in the Torres Strait, which means that a quick resolution is unlikely; at the earliest, a judgment might be delivered by the end of the year.\\nYouth Verdict v Waratah Coal\\nIn other countries, much successful climate litigation has been focused on human rights obligations. Yet in Australia, in the absence of constitutionally-entrenched rights or a federal charter of rights, such cases have failed to get off the ground. Until now.\\nAfter Queensland enacted its Human Rights Act in 2019, a coalition of young Queenslanders \u2013 Youth Verdict \u2013 challenged Clive Palmer\u2019s proposed Galilee basin coal mine. They are arguing that the mine, which would dig up 40 megatonnes of thermal coal each year, violates their right to life, Indigenous cultural rights, rights of children and the right to freedom from discrimination.\\nIn late 2020, the group\u2019s claim survived its first test \u2013 a preliminary application by Palmer\u2019s company to prevent Youth Verdict relying on human rights grounds in challenging the proposed mine. The relevance of human rights to the mine proposal will be considered in more detail in the coming months.\\nAustralasian Centre for Corporation Responsibility v Santos\\nAre major emitters misleading investors when they claim to have a \u201ccredible and clear plan\u201d to achieve \u201cnet zero\u201d in the coming decades, in the (alleged) absence of such an achievable plan? Is it unlawful to call natural gas \u201cclean energy\u201d, given it is a fossil fuel? These are among the questions to be argued between energy major Santos and shareholder group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, in a world-first test case filed last year in the federal court.\\nIf the ACCR is successful, Australian companies will have to be much more careful in communicating on climate issues, lest they be in breach of corporate and consumer law. The parties are currently undertaking discovery, with the case expected to be heard mid-year.\\nO\u2019Donnell v Commonwealth\\nIn another world-first case, a Victorian law student is suing the federal government. Katta O\u2019Donnell alleges the government is misleading investors, and therefore breaching corporate law, by failing to adequately disclose climate risks when issuing long-term sovereign bonds. Last year, the government tried to have the case thrown out, but lost \u2013 with Justice Bernard Murphy holding that the plaintiff had set out an arguable case and should be permitted access to government documents to refine her claim. The case will be heard late this year. If the law student wins, O\u2019Donnell could have a major impact globally on the way governments disclose climate risk in financial settings.\\nThe first climate case in Australia was brought in 1994, when Greenpeace challenged the construction of a coal-fired power station. In the subsequent decades, most climate litigation has been grounded in administrative law \u2013 challenging government decision-making that insufficiently mitigated or entirely ignored climate impact. It is only in recent years that improved science and continuing government and corporate inaction has prompted more creative climate lawyering, using tort law, corporate law, human rights law and beyond.\\nThat trend is set to continue. Last year, significant climate litigation cases were filed almost monthly; even more are anticipated this year. \u201cAs a nation, we are starting to wake up to how exposed we are to the risks of climate change,\u201d David Barnden, who has masterminded several recent climate cases, previously told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe law will respond to that.\u201d", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd2ac64c751fcf397e5d486f527466898fd36a1b/217_568_4601_2761/master/4601.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "School student Anj Sharma outside the federal court in Melbourne, with lawyer David Barnden and Sister Brigid Arthur."]], "author": ["Kieran Pender"], "date": "2022-02-11"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/11/why-the-shutdown-of-agls-coal-fired-plants-will-probably-happen-even-sooner-than-power-giant-says": {"title": "Why the shutdown of AGL\u2019s coal-fired plants will probably happen even sooner than power giant says", "subtitle": null, "text": "The two plants selected for early shutdown currently produce about 7% of Australia\u2019s total carbon emissions\\nWhen AGL, Australia\u2019s biggest electricity generator, announced plans on Thursday to accelerate the timetable to close its two largest coal-fired power plants, environmental groups complained the pace wasn\u2019t fast enough.\\nOut would go Bayswater, AGL\u2019s 2640-megawatt black coal-fired power plant in New South Wales\u2019s Hunter Valley, between 2030 and 2033, rather than 2035 as previously flagged. And by 2045, the 2210MW Loy Yang A brown coal-fired station in Victoria would follow, compared with a 2048 schedule, the company said.\\nThat at least was AGL\u2019s objective, Graeme Hunt, the company\u2019s chief executive told investors, adding with a flourish: \u201cthe path to net zero [emissions] will be the defining challenge of our era. Companies that don\u2019t adapt, that don\u2019t innovate, and don\u2019t set themselves on this path will be left behind\u201d.\\nGreenpeace Australia dismissed the new dates as a \u201ctoken effort\u201d, noting the two plants at current pollution rates add about 35m tonnes of CO2 yearly, or about 7% of the nation\u2019s total. The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility said the updated plan was \u201cnext to meaningless for these crumbling assets\u201d given Bayswater will be 48 years old by 2033 and in 2045, Loy Yang A will be 61 years old\u201d.\\nThe latter point was perhaps the most germaine. The Australian Energy Market Operator is already preparing scenarios for all brown coal plants and two-thirds of black coal ones to disappear from the grid by 2032.\\nThat\u2019s about a decade earlier than AGL is now forecasting for Loy Yang A.\\n\u201c[Thursday] will not be the last time the closure of a fossil fuel generator is brought forward,\u201d said Kane Thornton, chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, which counts AGL among its almost 1,000 members.\\n\u201cIf you look at the rate at which renewables are coming into the market, if you look at the rate at which big batteries are being deployed and the commitments that are being made in the projects being committed to, the pace of change is just accelerating.\u201d Thornton said.\\nData released a fortnight ago by Aemo underscored the woes facing AGL \u2013 which by 30 June plans to split into a generator arm Accel Energy and a retailing one, AGL Australia \u2013 and other big fossil-dominated generators like EnergyAustralia and Origin Energy.\\nGas and coal prices are being pushed higher by global supply constraints and rising demand, while costs of wind and solar farms are falling and their energy source is basically free. Plant profitability isn\u2019t helped, either, by 3m households with solar panels generating their own power, particularly during the middle of the day.\\nAs Aemo noted, Victoria\u2019s spot prices in the December quarter were on average negative between 09.25 and 14.20. Between 08.00 and 16.30, they averaged just 10 cents per MW-hour.\\nEnergyAustralia last year brought forward the planned closure of its Mt Piper coal-fired power plant near Lithgow in NSW by at least three years, while its Yallourn plant in Victoria will now shut in 2028 rather than 2032. Origin Energy, meanwhile, says the first of the units at its Eraring plant will shut in NSW by 2030.\\nDylan McConnell, an energy expert at the University of Melbourne said Aemo\u2019s draft integrated system plan has various scenarios based on emissions goals. The most ambitious, assuming a trajectory that is in line with keeping global warming to 1.5C, has the first of AGL\u2019s Loy Yang A\u2019s units closing by 2027 and all of it by 2029, he says.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a mismatch,\u201d McConnell says. \u201cYou have this sort of market approach and then you have this planning approach, and they just don\u2019t line up.\u201d\\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\\nOne reason is Aemo\u2019s modelling assumes a carbon budget. \u201cIn the real world, there isn\u2019t a carbon price or any financial penalty for that,\u201d he says. Not yet, at least.\\nAnother challenge is that while renewables have been booming, the pace of growth, particularly for new windfarms, has slowed sharply, in part because of planning uncertainties, McConnell says.\\nHead of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, Bruce Mountain, agrees there\u2019s every likelihood loss-making coal-fired power plants will drop out of the market faster than companies are saying publicly.\\nAGL\u2019s Bayswater, for instance, will lose its low-cost coal supplies from about 2024, which will then undermine its role as one of the more profitable plants. A 2030 closure date, if that\u2019s what happens, will be challenging for NSW, Mountain says.\\n\u201cThe NSW government needs to get another, call it 4000-5000MW of wind and solar capacity operational and producing by [2030], and a very good deal likely of storage capacity,\u201d he says.\\nNSW seems committed to implement its electricity infrastructure roadmap \u201cbut there isn\u2019t time to lose\u201d, Mountain says. Victoria is also stepping up its support for new generation capacity while Queensland \u201cremains the real laggard\u201d.\\nAemo, meanwhile, is also forecasting demand to almost double by 2050 to 330 terawatt-hours a year, from 180 TWh now, particularly as cars switch from petrol and diesel to electricity.\\nTo meet that demand and cope with plant closures, the current pipeline of proposed generation and storage capacity in the NEM stands at 138 gigawatts (GW), or more than double today\u2019s capacity of 59GW. Renewables account for 86% of proposed projects, Aemo says.\\nThe challenges facing the power sector will only grow, though, if hopes for a hydrogen export sector are realised, McConnell said\\n\u201cThe growth in electricity for that is really quite phenomenal,\u201d he says. \u201cSo there\u2019s a bit of a disconnect between what the market is doing or saying versus what the expectations are.\u201d", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e4abb5b40d187199f18790a4907774e02cc7497/815_0_3628_2177/master/3628.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "AGL\u2019s Bayswater coal-fired plant will shut down between two and five years early.

misogyny a hate crime in England and Wales and urge MPs to get behind controversial legislation that has been criticised for curbing the right to protest as the government seeks to push through major changes to the criminal justice system.\\nIn a move which will set up a clash with Conservative backbenchers and opposition MPs when the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill returns to parliament next week, the home secretary, Priti Patel, will write to members on Monday saying the government will oppose a Lords amendment that would extend hate crimes to cover misogyny.\\nThe Home Office said its rejection is based on a Law Commission report, which warned that extending hate crimes to cover misogyny would prove \u201cmore harmful than helpful\u201d to victims of violence against women and girls.\\nThe government says it is also \u201ccarefully considering\u201d a new offence of street harassment that would criminalise the verbal abuse of women, pestering and persistent cat-calling or making lewd comments.\\nA new Scottish standalone offence of misogyny is under discussion by an expert working group and is expected to report to ministers in Edinburgh this month.\\nThe letter comes after the government has been forced into a series of concessions on crime and violence against women and girls over the last few months.\\nResponding to the letter, Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, condemned Patel for failing to introduce new legislation to tackle hatred against women.\\n\u201cIt is shameful that the home secretary is still refusing to make violence against women and girls a strategic policing requirement so it has the same prominence as tackling organised crime.\\n\u201cShe is also still refusing to establish specialist rape units in every police force area or minimum sentence for rape and stalking, and shockingly is still resisting Labour\u2019s proposals for action against landlords who pressurise tenants into sex for rent,\u201d she said.\\nThe House of Lords inflicted a string of defeats on the bill last month, which saw the upper chamber reject controversial measures designed to combat the tactics adopted by groups including Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain and on a separate clause that would have imposed noise restrictions on demonstrations.\\nPeers also voted against new powers that would give police powers to stop and search those who they suspect of taking part in illegal protests.\\nThe upper chamber can delay, though not entirely block, legislation, but its actions can often embarrass and stall government plans.\\nThe bill returns to the Commons next week for a round of parliamentary ping-pong, where legislation passes between the two houses until an agreement is reached.\\nThe Home Office said the revised version of the draft law going before the Commons will tighten a number of measures, including extending the time limit for prosecution of common assault or battery in domestic abuse cases.\\nOfficials said the \u201cenhanced\u201d version of the draft legislation would also include introducing \u201cHarper\u2019s law\u201d, which will extend mandatory life sentences to those convicted of the unlawful manslaughter of an on-duty emergency worker.\\nIt follows a campaign by the widow of PC Andrew Harper, who was killed while responding to a quad bike theft by three teenagers in August 2019.\\nAddressing peers\u2019 amendment on adding misogyny as a hate crime, the Home Office cited how a Law Commission review had found that legislating to make misogyny a hate crime would prove \u201cmore harmful than helpful\u201d to victims of violence against women and girls.\\nHome Office officials said ministers would also \u201ccontinue fighting\u201d to bring in increase police powers

Patel said: \u201cThere are still too many criminals getting off with inadequate sentences for appalling acts of violence and sexual offences and still people who feel unsafe walking the streets or in

Brazil\u2019s Amazon", "subtitle": null, "text": "Satellite data shows rainforest cleared for cattle and maize on farms growing soya, undermining claims crop is deforestation-free\\nMore than 400 sq miles (1,000 sq km) of Amazon rainforest has been felled to expand farms growing soya in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso in a 10-year period, despite an agreement to protect it, according to a new investigation.\n  In 2006, the landmark Amazon soy moratorium was introduced banning the sale of soya grown on land deforested after 2008. From 2004 to 2012, the clearing of trees in the Amazon fell by 84%.\n  But in recent years deforestation has climbed steeply, reaching a 15-year high last year \u2013 encouraged, campaigners say, by President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s anti-conservationist rhetoric and policies.\\nWith the moratorium applying only to soya, farmers have been able to sell the crop as deforestation-free, while still clearing land for cattle, maize or other commodities.\\nTo map the deforestation, researchers from the Brazilian NGO Instituto Centro de Vida, along with Greenpeace\u2019s Unearthed and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, looked at satellite data of land where soya was being grown in Mato Grosso state, which stretches across the southern part of the Amazon. The state grows more soya than anywhere else in Brazil.\\nThey found that while studies show the moratorium had successfully stopped rainforest being directly converted into soya fields, deforestation had continued. Farmers were clearing land to grow commodities other than soya, with 450 sq miles of rainforest \u2013 equivalent in size to Greater Manchester \u2013 felled in Mato Grosso between 2009 and 2019, according to the research.Holly Gibbs, professor of geography and environmental studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US, said: \u201cAt the same time that soy farmers comply with the moratorium, they continue to deforest illegally for other purposes.\u201d\\nThe revelations undermine claims by supermarkets that soya is no longer linked to the loss of Amazon rainforest.\n  Soya is a key commodity used by dairy, cattle, pig and poultry farmers in Europe and the rest of the world to feed their livestock.\\nThe Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oil Industries (Abiove), the main association for soya traders in Brazil, said the moratorium had resulted in significant reductions in deforestation in municipalities that produce soya.\n  \u201cIf soy beans are planted in polygons [an area between a specified set of coordinates] with deforestation after 2008, the entire farm is considered noncompliant with the soy moratorium,\u201d Abiove said a statement.Previous analysis has suggested more than 1m tonnes of soya used by UK livestock farmers to produce chicken and other food in 2019 could have been linked to deforestation.\\nGibbs said pressure from soya buyers in Europe and the US was needed to stop the deforestation. \u201cLegislation in the EU, UK and the US raises the stakes of this ongoing deforestation on soy properties. The soy industry could consider broadening the Amazon soy moratorium to close the door to all deforestation connected to soy.\u201d\n Prof Raoni Raj\u00e3o, an agricultural specialist at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, said the current regulations were insufficient. \u201cOnly the specific areas where soy is grown are monitored, not the entire property. Farmers have already noticed this loophole.\u201d\\nThe Retail Soy Group, which represents leading retailers including Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco, Lidl and Waitrose, acknowledged there were limitations to the moratorium and said the new allegations \u201cfurther highlight the need to have strengthened legal protections of these vital ecosystems\u201d.Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the biggest farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

They argue that despite the fact there is strong evidence that accessible, nature-rich spaces boost our physical and mental wellbeing, and reduce mortality, one in three people in England cannot access nature near their home.\\nVisits to urban parks and other green spaces nearly doubled in the decade before the pandemic, from 1.2bn in 2009-10 to 2.1bn in 2018-19.\\nThe poorest communities fare worse, as they are twice as likely to live in a neighbourhood without nature-rich spaces. The coalition, which includes Greenpeace, Wildlife and Countryside Link, Institute for Public Policy Research, and The Wildlife Trusts, adds that access to nature should be included in any plans to \u201clevel up\u201d.\\nResearch by Wildlife and Countryside Link, which on Monday launches a petition to urge the government to put this into law, found that 80% of the British public support a legal right to local nature and 85% say it should be a priority for all new housing developments to include accessible natural spaces.\\nDr Richard Benwell, the CEO of Wildlife and Countryside Link, told the Guardian that Michael Gove, secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities, as good as ignored nature in his white paper.\\nHe said: \u201cThere were some references to nature, you had to turn to page 212 or something like that, but people\u2019s environmental rights were not included in the headline announcements.\\n\u201cIt was notable that the six \u2018capitals\u2019 included in the paper didn\u2019t include natural capital, which it clearly should have done.\u201d\\nCampaigners added that many natural spaces are under threat of development, with 11% of urban green space lost in the past 15 years.\\nLocal authorities could improve access to nature by having better transport links to green spaces, improving substandard and neglected patches of natural land, and creating new parks. Campaigners add that improving the quality of local natural spaces is also vital to help meet government targets to protect 30% of land for nature by 2030 and halt the decline in species by 2030.\\nCraig Bennett, the chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts, said: \u201cHaving access to wild places and wildlife shouldn\u2019t be a privilege, but a part of everyday life. We know how much people treasure time spent in nature near where they live, but for many communities this simply isn\u2019t possible. The most deprived areas have nine times less green space than the wealthiest \u2013 and poorer areas are where people\u2019s health is the worst.\\n\u201cOur towns and cities have a huge role to play in nature\u2019s recovery. We need to create and join up habitats, enabling species to recover and benefiting people too. It is critical that nature is at the heart of all planning and development, for wildlife, communities, and climate.\u201d\\nTV stars including Deborah Meaden from Dragons\u2019 Den and the Springwatch presenter Gillian Burke have backed the bid.\\nMeaden said: \u201cIt\u2019s increasingly clear that there are huge inequalities in the amount of green spaces and access to nature that people can enjoy close to home. I\u2019ve always felt passionately that having nature close to the places where people live, work and visit is critical for our mental and physical health.\\n\u201cDespite 80% of Brits wanting a \u2018legal right to local nature\u2019, it is not yet set out in law, which means that building developments do not have to take this into account.
