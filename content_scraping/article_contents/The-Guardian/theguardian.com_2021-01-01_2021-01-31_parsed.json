The government\u2019s official report on the mine in September 2020 said the mine would not have been \u201cenvironmentally acceptable\u201d.\\nSpeaking about the plans in Cumbria, Bosworth said: \u201cAllowing coal to be extracted from this proposed mine for over a quarter of a century completely undermines the government\u2019s credibility on the climate crisis \u2013 especially ahead of the crucial UN summit later this year, which the UK is hosting.\\n\u201cGlobal leadership on the climate emergency means leaving coal in the ground, where it belongs.\u201d\\nDr Ruth Balogh, who represents Friends of the Earth in the West Cumbria area, described the government\u2019s decision as \u201castonishing and desperately disappointing\u201d.\\nShe said: \u201cWest Cumbria badly needs local jobs, but these should be generated by investing in clean energy and building a greener future, not industries that threaten the planet.\\n\u201cThe region has already experienced the effects of the climate crisis from recent flooding. Unless we say no to fossil fuels this will only get worse.\u201d\\nGreenpeace UK\u2019s policy director, Doug Parr, called on Jenrick to \u201cimmediately reverse his decision not to call this in\u201d.\\n\u201cClaims that it will be carbon neutral are like claiming an oil rig is a wind turbine,\u201d he said.\\n\u201cOf course, job creation is absolutely vital to communities but we must look forward to the jobs of 21st century, not back to those in declining industries.\u201d\\nThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said in response: \u201cThe general approach of the secretary of state is not to interfere with the decision-making process of local councils on planning matters. The government\u2019s position is that these matters are generally best determined locally, by local councils that know their own area best, rather than by central government.\\n\u201cThe secretary of state\u2019s power to call in a case will be used very selectively, and in general only if planning issues of more than local importance are involved.\u201d\\nThe mine would be used to extract coking coal from beneath the Irish Sea for steel production.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87f33164029c591bc81b643b15c46f3ab977523c/594_330_2841_1705/master/2841.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Robert Jenrick"]], "author": null, "date": "2021-01-06"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/08/more-than-1000-extinction-rebellion-activists-taken-to-court": {"title": "More than 1,000 Extinction Rebellion activists taken to court", "subtitle": null, "text": "People may have to travel to London despite pandemic in one of biggest protest crackdowns in UK legal history\\nMore than 1,000 people who took part in environmental direct action organised by Extinction Rebellion have been taken to court in what experts say is one of the biggest crackdowns on protest in British legal history.\\nHundreds of cases are ongoing and lawyers say that despite the pandemic, some defendants may still be asked to travel to court in London from across the UK to appear in person.\\nLawyers for the defendants say the scale of the prosecutions and the decision to press ahead with trials during the pandemic is unprecedented, and putting people\u2019s health at risk.\\nRaj Chada, a solicitor from Hodge Jones and Allen, which is representing many of the defendants, said: \u201cThese clients come from across the country, and the court system is just getting to grips with remote attendances. The Covid crisis is at its height, yet the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] are continuing these cases at great financial cost.\u201d\\nXR have staged three major \u201crebellions\u201d over the past two years to highlight the escalating climate and ecological emergency and demand urgent action from the government. The peaceful protests brought large parts of London to a standstill for days, with printing presses of rightwing newspapers blockaded and fossil fuel companies targeted.\\nXR says more than 3,400 people have been arrested, with about 1,700 charged, almost all for minor public order offences such as obstructing the highway. About 900 people have pleaded guilty and another 800 have either been tried or are awaiting their day in court.\\nZo\u00eb Blackler, who has overseen the courts process for XR, said it had highlighted the range of people who were prepared to take a stand to force urgent action on the climate emergency. \u201cThey come from all across the country and from every age range \u2013 there are as many people over 65 as in their 20s. I\u2019ve met doctors and delivery drivers, teachers and builders, even a retired merchant mariner in his 80s.\u201d\\nShe said some people had been campaigning on the environment for years, but for most it was the first time they had taken part in activism \u201cand certainly their first encounter with the criminal justice system\u201d.\\nChada said the decision to press ahead with the prosecutions was not in the public interest. \u201cOne wonders who is making these decisions and what pressure they are under,\u201d he said.\\nGraeme Hayes, a sociologist from Aston University, who is part of a team of researchers following the XR court cases, agreed the decision to prosecute so many people for minor offences was highly unusual. \u201cWhat we are seeing looks very much like political decisions to charge people and to take them to court for very minor offences, and that is extraordinary. I can not think of a precedent [in the UK] where that has happened before on anything like this scale.\u201d\\nHayes said it appeared to be the result of political pressure, possibly from the home secretary, Priti Patel, who labelled XR as criminals who threatened the \u201cUK way of life\u201d, and from the police, who were criticised after the April 2019 protests.\\nThe Crown Prosecution Service said it was an independent, \u201cdemand-led organisation\u201d with a duty to consider all cases referred by police. \u201cEvery case is assessed solely on its individual merits, and prosecutions will only follow if our legal tests are met,\u201d it said.\\nIn November, XR announced it was planning a money rebellion \u2013 a campaign of financial civil disobedience to expose the \u201cpolitical economy\u2019s complicity\u201d in the ecological crisis.

But I\u2019m not really interested in the economy; I\u2019m interested in what makes a person feel alive. And getting involved with a campaign, no matter how big, can make you feel much better, much more engaged \u2013 even energised \u2013 than just sitting and worrying about the state of the world.\\nHow does an effective campaigner get started? I asked Alena Ivanova, 33, because I think she embodies the activist life well lived. She came to the UK eight years ago from Bulgaria, where there are very few entry points to activism: no developed student movement, little spontaneous campaigning. \u201cIt was living in London that radicalised me. I thought things would be different, but better. Actually they were different, but the same: people were just as devoid of real power to make decisions about their lives, and it was so expensive that everyone was too busy working to think about it. You either have to make a retreat into yourself, or you have to commit to trying to make it better for everyone.\u201d\\nIvanova found groups through word-of-mouth. A guy she met on Tinder suggested a left-wing reading group; from there she joined the Women\u2019s Strike and Sisters Uncut; and then got involved with the Labour party. She\u2019s since battled everything from the closure of a community language programme to Britain exiting the EU. \u201cNational campaigns, which were epic failures, local campaigns, which were small failures. My only experience of success was getting the freedom of movement motion past the Labour conference.\u201d This was in 2019, when an overwhelming number of motions forced the party not only to uphold freedom of movement \u2013 which their 2017 manifesto had promised to end \u2013 but to extend it. Ivanova ruefully points out that there\u2019s little mention of this motion now.\\nBut if you think political action seems worth it only when it succeeds, going in a straight line from raising awareness, through fundraising, to getting parliamentary attention, to changing the law, well, you have to ditch all that. It\u2019s not couch to 5k: you can\u2019t put your civic identity through a set of key performance indicators. This is why activism and voluntary work are different from the usual run of happiness-booster suggestions: because you can\u2019t control the outcome simply by working harder, you almost certainly won\u2019t always succeed and there will be moments where, if you care, it is very painful. That\u2019s the joy, I suppose: it\u2019s more like life than yoga is. But just like yoga, you have to find an approach that works for you. To decide which, ask yourself these key questions:\\nThe assumption about altruism is that you have to want to interact the whole time \u2013 in an activist context, to be in constant debate or always at a protest; and in charity work, be dealing directly with someone in need.\\nBut there are roles for all personality types. Sophie Livingstone, 43, runs Trustees Unlimited (a company that matches charities with trustees, and that aims, among other things, to improve diversity among trustee bodies). She is shortly to take over at Little Village, a baby bank (like a food bank but for baby-related gear), and says, \u201cWe have volunteers who interact directly with families, but there are other people who just want to sort babygrows.\u201d Both are useful.\\nThe same is true politically: if canvassing is your idea of hell, you might help behind the scenes, with organising or planning. Perhaps you could devise a map of food poverty like All Of Us Together, which was inspired by Marcus Rashford\u2019s campaign; or if you can code, join the Radical Engineers and be matched with a project that needs a developer.\\nOnce you have a passion for a cause, such as migrant rights, there are a near infinite number of entry points, from housing a refugee yourself to resisting racism locally. Zoe Gardner, 32, is policy adviser at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants. She describes grassroots initiatives, which always need more support: \u201cBefriending services, legal advice, talking to people, handing out food and donations.\u201d Be realistic about how much time you can commit and it will help focus your efforts.\\nIn 2015, Gardner realised she wanted to go all in, and spent two months on the Greek island of Lesbos at the height of the refugee crisis. Together with an anarchist group, she helped with \u201cbringing in boats, giving people a hot drink and dry clothes, directing them to the official refugee camp\u201d. The scene was very mixed, politically \u2013 anarchists working with Islamic Relief, and maverick Kent mothers who had never done campaign work before. It was disorganised and imperfect: some people used these groups as a symbol of how useless the EU was. But in a way, part of the ad hoc movement\u2019s success was that, in its spontaneous internationalism, it made plain what European institutions wouldn\u2019t admit: this wasn\u2019t a Greek problem, it was an us-problem. Besides, Gardner says, \u201cHow many more people would have just felt unwelcome, if we hadn\u2019t done that?\u201d This experience seeded Gardner\u2019s attitude today, in her professional life: that however adverse the political context, the work she does never feels pointless. There is no such thing as wasted human connection.\\nPeople often think in binaries: are you political or altruistic? Are you a person in need or a volunteer? When truthfully, we are all of these things. It\u2019s time to collapse the distinction between the helper and the helped, something addiction and prison services have known for years: there is no more effective support than that which comes from someone who\u2019s been there.\\nDanny O\u2019Donoghue, 53, is area manager of the Richmond Fellowship, a mental health charity, and describes some volunteers who previously suffered severe mental illness, and who now run a Hearing Voices group. \u201cIf you ever want to know total isolation, try hearing voices. Nothing is more alienating than something you can\u2019t share. When clinicians ran these groups, they were poorly attended \u2013 sometimes the staff outnumbered the people. That never happens with volunteers with experience. I was struck by one saying, \u2018The voices have always been the thing I hide, that I find some way to bury. The pleasure in this instance is being able to wear it as a uniquely qualifying asset, to apply it in support of someone else\u2019s recovery.\u2019\u201d\\n\u201cJoin a political party\u201d is like the bromide of activism, not in the sense that it\u2019s soothing, in the sense that it\u2019s just so boring, a fire blanket over the spirit \u2013 especially the endless meetings. I never heard this as plainly expressed as by the Bernie Sanders campaigner Claire Sandberg, whose motto was, \u201cNever have groups: it creates a tyranny of the annoying\u201d; and her sub-motto, \u201cNever have a meeting whose action is another meeting.\u201d\\nIf you want to see those principles in action, look at the most momentous movements of the recent past: Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion. Rupert Read, a co-founder, describes XR as \u201cnothing like the Green party, it\u2019s not a membership organisation. Anyone can act in the name of XR, provided they adhere to its values, principally nonviolence.\u201d This has led to some \u201cvery unpopular actions \u2013 with XR, let alone with the public. But it shifted the conversation. Power conceded something to all of XR\u2019s demands. I was there when we met Michael Gove, and the next day parliament put through a symbolic emergency climate motion unopposed. The last two years have been the best years of my life, finally being involved with something that was successful. But it\u2019s not just about success. The really striking thing is how joyful, satisfying, meaningful and regenerative this has been.\u201d\\nCompass\n  A campaigning group for a more equal, democratic and sustainable society.

Here are their tips\\nIrene Lewington, 92, London\\nWhen my husband died in 2001, it took time to find my feet again: years of caring for him had taken a toll. One day I woke up and thought, \u201cRight, now it\u2019s my time\u201d: you\u2019ve got to make the most of the time you have left. I did a computer course, tried skydiving, then gave drag racing a go. My sixtysomething son and I drive up to the courses together, then he jumps out and I take the wheel. I get such a buzz from it; I\u2019m never happy if I cross the line at under 100mph. Nothing has gone wrong so far.\\nMy children are pensioners themselves; they don\u2019t need me the way they used to. I\u2019ve no regrets about raising our family and working hard to support them \u2013 but that job is done now. If I dropped dead tomorrow, it wouldn\u2019t change the world, so I may as well enjoy myself. While you\u2019re still breathing, just get on with it and have some fun. I\u2019ve still got swimming with sharks at the London Aquarium to arrange.\\nJeni Coombs, 73, Bognor Regis\\nI\u2019ve been volunteering at the Age UK gym since I moved here a few years back, so didn\u2019t think much of being asked to help oversee some new classes. When I was told they were pole fitness and burlesque lessons, I couldn\u2019t wait. I\u2019d never done anything like it, but I threw myself in at the deep end. I\u2019ve been dressed as a nun, dancing on a pole on our Sister Act float at the Bognor carnival, and done a saucy festive chair dance to Santa Baby in cute velvet shorts.\\nFor most of my life I would have been too embarrassed \u2013 worried what people might think of me. That, I\u2019ve realised, doesn\u2019t matter. If someone isn\u2019t pleased you\u2019re enjoying yourself, then that\u2019s their problem, not yours. There\u2019s nothing like feeling sexy to keep you young. My kids don\u2019t say much about it, but honestly? It\u2019s none of their business.\\nKevan Gee, 75, Rugeley\\nThe kids were worried about us at the start of lockdown, with all the talk of the over-70s being vulnerable. I sent them some videos, the first of me jumping on the sofa like a toddler; I was decorating the house one day, so I put on silly clothes and danced around with my paintbrush to Billy Joel\u2019s Uptown Girl, as my wife jiggled around with a feather duster.\\nI worked as a supervisor at a power station for many years: humour kept the team happy on good days and stopped anyone getting dejected when critical incidents and mistakes occurred. A lighthearted approach instead of iron fist discipline keeps everyone smiling and on side. You\u2019ve got to stay childish and silly; once you lose that, you settle into an austere and miserable old age. And it\u2019s not only about keeping yourself happy, but the people around you, too.\\nJanie Booth, 79, London\\nI was on the train home a few years ago, returning from playing a small part in an episode of Doctors. I got talking to a wealthy-looking man in his 50s. He looked miserable, and asked why I was grinning. I said how fabulous my day at work had been.\\nHe told me he\u2019d wanted to be a weatherman but never followed up on it because he wanted a big house with all the trimmings. I didn\u2019t want to upset him by asking about his job, but he was as rich as anything. He hated all the jobs he\u2019d ever done. \u201cDarling,\u201d I said, \u201cyou\u2019ve done it all wrong.\u201d\\nI have been an actor for 63 years and I\u2019m very good at it. I\u2019ve done plenty of television, films and theatre: I love playing parts of insulting brevity wherever they come. Of course, if international stardom had come knocking I\u2019d have loved it, but I do what I do because it\u2019s fun. I took three years out in my 50s to learn how to restore furniture because I fancied it, then went straight back to acting; just follow what you feel in your heart.\\nJohn Starbrook, 90, Windsor\\nMy wife laughed at me in 1983 when I told her I was going up to London to register for the marathon. I\u2019d never considered running before, but heard on the radio that the deadline was that afternoon, and on a whim thought, why not? It felt like such an achievement when I crossed the finish line, but I was exhausted and swore I\u2019d never do it again. To this day, I\u2019ve completed 32 London marathons, and 52 in total. I was the oldest person competing last time.\\nIf you try something and fail, it\u2019s still better than not trying. I never thought I\u2019d finish my first marathon, and could have not bothered to take the punt. Jumping in head-first set me on a course for the rest of my life. Now I ask people what their dreams are, and keep them motivated. My greatest pleasure is twisting the arms of people who think something like running or swimming isn\u2019t for them, and then seeing them finish their first triathlon with a massive smile. I don\u2019t want people to look at me and think I\u2019m impressive. Just see what I do and think, well, if that old fella can do it, I can, too.\\nDavid Cook, 79, Gloucestershire\\nI had a strange childhood: my father was a banker in Australia and our family was travelling by boat to his new posting when we were captured by the Germans and taken to Japan. My mother, father, older sister and I were held as prisoners of war until 1945. My challenge was to face that, and find a future that was better. I came to faith in my late teens.\\nAs a clergyman, I\u2019ve seen every form of suffering. I could easily have become an atheist: I\u2019ve dealt with everything from suicides to car accidents, cancer, divorce and murder. I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s how you face these things, then learn from them, that counts. Don\u2019t avoid people who are suffering; reach out to them, take their pain and enter into it. Listen, so you feel it yourself, then, with their permission, offer guidance: don\u2019t bury or deny suffering, embrace it; its power will quickly be diminished and you\u2019ll grow from it when you do. Make sure they are surrounded by loved ones to support them, whether they\u2019re weeping, consumed by anger or searching for joy. Remember, these feelings won\u2019t dissipate quickly \u2013 make sure they know you\u2019re in with them for the long haul. Of course, I\u2019d tell them the church is here, too.\\nHazel Mason, 71, London\\nI was aware of climate change before I joined Extinction Rebellion, but I\u2019m no politician or scientist; I just assumed that at some point powerful people would take the lead. But when I heard on the radio that Donald Trump was pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, it became obvious to me we couldn\u2019t leave it to them.\\nI felt deeply that I had to do something: if I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d be negligent. When I look at my grandchildren, I try to imagine their futures. I won\u2019t be here in a few decades to help them, so I asked myself: what can I do with the years I have? That\u2019s when I founded the Extinction Rebellion grandparents\u2019 group: I realised it\u2019s never too late to stand up and be counted. I started off running information stalls and family activities at festivals; since then I\u2019ve protested and been arrested, too.\\n", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfb3669a48e39982483b7fc778bfd487bb78bc56/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Little and large jokey false teeth against a yellow background"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e1654a5522f96b481c5c9f90e2e28d893e0c101/1803_873_871_896/master/871.jpg?width=120&dpr=1&s=none", "jokey false teeth"]], "author": ["Michael Segalov"], "date": "2021-01-09"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/25/tories-wokeness-labour-identity-politics-government": {"title": "The Tory fixation on wokeness is all about division.

At least last decade\u2019s \u201copposite world\u201d meant what it said: whatever the truth was, ministers would blame the opposite. In the creation of poverty, the culprit was the poor rather than the rich; in the nightmare of Brexit, the problem was remainers rather than leavers; in a runaway climate crisis, the root cause was Extinction Rebellion rather than fossil fuels and all those who\u2019d hitched their finances to them.\\nIt was pretty tedious, but it was preferable to today\u2019s opposite world, in which, despite whatever is important \u2013 from Covid rates to customs turmoil \u2013 ministers will be trying their level best to talk about what is petty. (A piquant, if tangential, example: Monday\u2019s Daily Telegraph, the little drummer boy of the endless culture war, reported approvingly the idea of an \u201canti-woke Citizens Advice service\u201d.) They create pantomimes, patriots battling straw men over trivia. This would make no sense if it came from a state in the grip of a crisis, but it makes every sense from a state with only one aim \u2013 the survival of its ruling party. To the modern conservative, all government business is party business.\\nA typical explanation is that it\u2019s all distraction: while we\u2019re blaming each other for wokeness or bigotry, that\u2019s all energy not directed at the government. The more intense the debate, the more divisions it opens up within as well as between each side, so there is no oxygen for more productive discussions. This theory is true as far as it goes but, like the one about why planes stay in the air, it\u2019s insufficient. An electorate fighting among itself will always be less challenging to its government \u2013 yet governments do not typically rely on disunity and sourness, still less work so hard to create them. The question is, what political capital does all this generate?\\nIn the late 1990s, the sociologist Nancy Fraser described how \u201ccultural recognition\u201d \u2013 the recognition of difference, what we used to call identity politics \u2013 had displaced \u201csocioeconomic redistribution as the remedy for injustice\u201d. It was Fraser\u2019s aim to try and knit recognition and redistribution back together, since justice required both: there was no point being culturally emancipated if you were still materially oppressed by low wages.\\nOver four grim Brexit years, William Davies, another sociologist, drew out the evolution of \u201crecognition\u201d politics to the present day. Our concept of different identities had shrunk to one: the \u201cleft-behind\u201d, AKA the red wall, previously known as the white working class. All other banners that people might congregate behind \u2013 ethnicity, race, gender, sexuality \u2013 were collapsed into \u201cmetropolitan\u201d, which was then elided with \u201celite\u201d to become de facto inauthentic. Nobody had to recognise you if you weren\u2019t real. It was a bit of a surprise, to be honest; not to find that I\u2019m a despised elite (I knew that), but that so was my whole postcode.\\nIn terms of the left-behind, which may have been newly prominent in 2016 but wasn\u2019t a new construct, the Labour government had typically been good at redistribution but bad at recognition. This reached its apotheosis in Gordon Brown\u2019s famous \u201cbigoted woman\u201d moment. As gaffes go, it would have passed without remark had it not been seen to contain some essential truth \u2013 that he and his predecessor despised the very people they claimed to prioritise.\\nThree Conservative prime ministers, meanwhile, have been very good at recognition and heartbreakingly bad at redistribution. They have systematically impoverished the very people whose worldview they say they champion. Their failure to redistribute needs little analysis: they don\u2019t do it because they choose not to.\\nYet this quest for identity-building issues \u2013 patriotism, British exceptionalism, nostalgia, monoculturalism \u2013 is much more than a simple balancing act: \u201cHere, have this orgy of flag-waving in lieu of liveable sick pay.\u201d It has proved extremely useful to them in neutralising the Labour party, which for more than 10 years has been unable to find solid ground on this matter.\\nSuccessive Labour leaders have essayed the acts of recognition that focus groups have told them were required, and either failed quietly, by shuffling away their inconvenient points of difference, or failed explosively \u2013 Ed Miliband\u2019s \u201ccurbs on immigration\u201d mug, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s bungled attempt to whip for abstention on a really ugly immigration bill in 2019. The problem is not that they disappoint their beloved liberal elite, but rather that nobody believes them; nobody ever bought that Miliband was anti-immigration, or that Corbyn supported Brexit, or that Keir Starmer has a union flag in his kitchen. If they\u2019re not who they say they are, who on earth are they? They defy definition, and the blurring effect follows them even when they exit enemy territory to talk about the NHS or regional inequality, so that a soft Tory like Jeremy Hunt can sound more convincing on social care than any given Labour MP.\\nThe Conservatives\u2019 culture wars, as boring as they are, have been magnificently effective, partly because they are agile. The current fixation on \u201cwokeness\u201d is an adaptation to the fact that \u201celitism\u201d as an idea was beginning to fray. Labour cannot carry on surrendering to a Tory version of recognition which will always shape-shift on demand, but nor can it go back to ignoring recognition altogether.\\nInstead, Labour needs to attack the foundational myth: the Conservatives haven\u2019t done anything complicated; they have merely characterised the red wall exclusively by those features with which all the other walls \u2013 the youth wall, the tartan wall, the metropolitan wall \u2013 could not possibly agree. But there are other issues on which these constituencies would agree, ideas that may sound economic but actually form the cornerstone of identities: that one ought, for instance, to be able to sustain oneself with dignity and without hardship by working. This has much higher salience than what \u201cwoke\u201d does or doesn\u2019t mean. There is opportunity in the sheer silliness of the current debate for Labour to start building their red bridge.\\nZoe Williams is a Guardian columnist", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dba564981e5b51f305ea0b60252d8a8aa6a6bd3/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Keir Starmer during an address to the Fabian Society on Saturday 16 January."]], "author": ["Zoe Williams"], "date": "2021-01-25"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jan/17/is-the-boom-in-communal-living-really-the-good-life": {"title": "Is the boom in communal living really the good life?", "subtitle": null, "text": "Driven by green concerns, house prices, the desire for a simpler existence \u2013 and now Covid, too \u2013 there\u2019s been a boom in communal living\\nAfter 40 years, Dave Hodgson has a sixth sense when it comes to an aspiring communard. \u201cIf they take one look at our shared bathrooms and say they need a good scrub, or complain about having to put a jumper on when Old Dragon packs in, they won\u2019t make it,\u201d Hodgson says, referring to his commune\u2019s biomass boiler.\\nWould-be members used to contact Bergholt Hall, one of Britain\u2019s longest standing farming communes, at the rate of 70 or so a year: 50-something empty nesters looking for companionship; 30-something couples in pursuit of an idyllic upbringing for their children; 20-somethings keen to erect a yurt on the hall\u2019s rolling Suffolk pasture. Since the Covid lockdowns, however, Hodgson admits, it\u2019s been \u201cbonkers\u201d. \u201cWe had 70 applications in April and May alone.\u201d\\nIt\u2019s a pattern echoed across the UK, with communes reporting being inundated by new applicants of all ages, driven by the Extinction Rebellion movement and its focus on low-carbon living and, more recently, by the glimpse that lockdown has offered of simpler, less consumption-driven, lifestyles.\\nThere are more than 400 such \u201cintentional\u201d communities across the UK. Many are cohousing set-ups, in which residents live in individual dwellings with a few common areas and domestic functions; others are based upon a lifestyle or worldview (spiritualism, gender non- binarism, veganism) and feature a variety of communal labour arrangements and facilities.\\nA surprising number are longstanding country communes, such as Bergholt Hall, founded in the heyday of the 1960s and 70s back-to-the-land and self-sufficiency movements. It was an era when an ideological generation of \u201cdiggers\u201d (named after the 17th-century English communards) sought to challenge notions of the sanctity of the nuclear family and opt out of \u201cthe grab-game of straight society\u201d (as hippy bible Oz magazine put it in a 1968 article on the first London digger commune).\\n\u201cSixties and 70s communalism was a backlash against hi-tech postwar societies,\u201d says Professor Luke Martell, who teaches a module on alternative societies at the University of Sussex. \u201cThese movements had a grand vision to change society, often along lines of economic communism, and rejected social norms such as monogamy and the concept of traditional childhood. Of course, with the failure of the communist states, these revolutionary ideas lost currency, even as the communities they gave rise to live on.\u201d\\nHelen Jarvis, a professor of social geography at Newcastle University, sees the renewed interest in communalism as one expression of a \u201cneotribalism\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a groundswell of common yearning for connectedness and for a sort of radical alternative,\u201d she explains. \u201cThis is about housing, but it\u2019s also about how people are choosing to eat and to form human connections. There\u2019s a recognition that the lifestyles of the past are permanently broken.\u201d\\n\u201cIt was all about John Seymour [author of the 1976 bestseller The Complete Book of Self-Sufficiency] back then,\u201d recalls Hodgson, who lived in London squats across London during the 70s. He later settled at Bergholt Hall, a 19th-century great house with a Queen Anne function room, wood and metalworking workshops, dairy, orchards, and shared kitchen, laundry and bathroom facilities.\\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t mind things being a bit rustic. Today\u2019s generation, Thatcher\u2019s kids raised with central heating in every room of the house, don\u2019t expect our draughty corridors.\u201d\\nIt\u2019s perhaps natural that there are tensions between old-guard communalists (typically referred to as \u201celders\u201d) and those arriving to communalism in the wake of Covid, and as the climate crisis gathers pace. Long gone are the days when a rambling country pile could be bought for a few tens of thousands of pounds, and it can cost eye-watering sums to join a traditional rural commune. Many of the original communities, including Bergholt Hall, Canon Frome Court in Herefordshire and Postlip Hall in Cheltenham, require substantial capital buy-ins from new members (a unit for a single person at Bergholt Hall costs from \u00a397,809). Despite popular conceptions, it\u2019s not a fall-back option if times are hard.\\nFinancial barriers mean that more than 50% of intentional communities fail within their first two years says Chris Coates, author of Utopia Britannica and a moderator of Diggers and Dreamers, a communal-living networking group that has seen a quadrupling of its membership since lockdown to 14,400 members.\\nMotivations have changed over two intervening generations. Today\u2019s 20- and 30-somethings are more likely to talk of post-carbon living or permaculture, in which ecosystems are viewed as inextricably interlinked, rather than self-sufficiency or communalism for its own sake.\\nArran Skinner, 21, has lived at Erraid, a farming commune in the Inner Hebrides, since 2018. He came to communal living out of a yearning to live close to nature and minimise his carbon footprint\\n\u201cMany of my friends were heading off to uni and I didn\u2019t know what to do, so I came here as a volunteer and just stayed on,\u201d he says.\\nSkinner believes many people in their 20s are excluded from communal living due to prohibitive costs, opting to travel between farms and communities as a Wwoofer (seasonal worker), or pitching up at of a handful of woodlands communities, such as Tinker\u2019s Bubble in Somerset and Stewards Wood in Devon, where conditions are basic and residents live under constant threat of eviction. The Isle of Erraid, and its sister commune Findhorn on the Moray coast, are unusual in paying members for their community labour contribution in food and board.\\nA looming issue for enduring intentional communities is what Kirsten Stevens-Wood, who researches the subject at Cardiff Metropolitan University, refers to as \u201cunintentional ageing\u201d. Despite the original diggers\u2019 hope of \u201cautomating out all drudgery, toiling and moiling\u2026 so every cat can do his or her own thing\u201d, rural survival requires as much elbow grease today as it did in the 1970s.\\n\u201cAll of the things that these communities were doing 30 years ago \u2013 digging vegetable patches, splitting firewood \u2013 are much harder when you\u2019re still there doing them in your 70s,\u201d Stevens-Wood says.\\nFindhorn, for example, has an average resident age of 55, and Bergholt Hall has taken to curating its intake to balance ageing residents with young families and, like other 1960s and 1970s-established communes, is exploring financial instruments to enable incomers with little access to capital to join the community, such as shared ownership and loans. This means that single applicants to Bergholt Hall who are in their 50s and 60s (who represent over half of approaches) are likely to be disappointed. But it also means \u201celders\u201d tend to step back when it comes to decision-making by consensus. \u201cThere\u2019s an awareness that new families are on their way in, and we\u2019re on the way out,\u201d Dave Hodgson adds.\\nRory Hodgson, 43, is Dave\u2019s son and grew up with his mother in \u201ca typical semi in Ipswich\u201d, but spent idyllic summers as a teenager at Bergholt Hall. As an adult, he found himself priced out of his father\u2019s commune and now lives at Redfield, a housing co-op in Buckinghamshire established in 1978, where a 19th-century mansion and 17 acres of grounds and mature fruit orchards are owned in trust. Residents pay rent and dabble in organic farming, but typically work two to three days a week outside the commune to cover their outgoings. \u201cRedfield isn\u2019t about private ownership and what\u2019s me and mine,\u201d Hodgson says.\\nIn his view, new recruits to communalism are more pragmatic than boomer diggers, such as his father. \u201cFeeding yourselves from the land year-round with no money coming in like that 1970s fantasy is bloody hard work,\u201d he says. \u201cAt Redfield the kids go to normal schools and we have paid jobs. These days there\u2019s a desire to have the best of both worlds.\u201d\\nFounding ideologies are not, however, fully a thing of the past. Tensions emerge in rural communes around fault-lines such as diet, says Jenny Pickerill, a professor of environmental geography at the University of Sheffield who has studied intentional communities around the world. \u201cI\u2019ve known of secret breakaway meat-eating groups in communes that are technically vegan or veg,\u201d Pickerill laughs, adding that whatever their age British communards often exhibit what she terms a \u201cdeep green-ism\u201d in comparison to their counterparts elsewhere.\\nStaci Sylvan, 42, a birth doula, lives in Heartwood, set up on the principle of non-violent cooperation. Heartwood is in Carmarthenshire, a region of Wales that\u2019s historically attracted Britons keen to live alternative lifestyles, but where feelings can run high about English incomers. Sylvan welcomes a recent flurry of interest from younger would-be communards, many of whom, she says, have arrived at alternative living through Extinction Rebellion and climate camps. \u201cI came to communalism through protest groups in the 1990s. When I first joined Heartwood I was in my 20s and would thrash about trying to change things in the commune. Now I accept all the compromises that this kind of living requires.\u201d\\nAndrea Jones, whose PhD focused on intergenerational relations in communes, believes emotional literacy is the secret of older communes\u2019 success: \u201cFor communal living to work, individuals need to put in the emotional labour: being tolerant of each other\u2019s foibles, for example, and being willing to let go of petty grievances.\u201d One reason spiritual communities such as Erraid thrive, says Stevens-Wood, is that they \u201chave something that unites them and promotes considerate behaviour, whereas a wave of communes set up in the 1990s on purely ecological grounds collapsed, in many cases, into infighting\u201d.\\nBob Fromer, 78, lives at Birchwood Hall \u2013 a green and feminist commune in the Malvern Hills that was established in 1970 \u2013 with his partner Lynda Medwell, 70. Also a veteran of the 1970s London squatting scene, Fromer briefly set up his own community before joining Birchwood Hall in 1984 and loves Birchwood\u2019s communal meals, views and the camaraderie on the monthly maintenance days, when they work on upkeep of the gardens and buildings. For Fromer, tolerance and \u201ca robust constitution\u201d are the requisite qualities in a successful communard. \u201cWe get a lot of applicants who need looking after, but we are not a therapeutic community, so we need members who are self-sufficient. If you\u2019ve come from a nuclear family and can\u2019t shake the privacy that comes with our way of living, or are very house-proud, it generally won\u2019t work.\u201d\\nDaniela Zapf says that Covid has redoubled her ambition to live in a large community. Born in Germany, she arrived at Findhorn aged 22 and originally planned to stay for a few weeks. Six years later she\u2019s still there. Zapf lives in Bag End one of a cluster of wood-built homes in the Findhorn ecovillage site. \u201cThe best part for me is the bonds we have here, like these ancient tribal bonds, not quite family but something much more than friendship\u201d she says, talking about what keeps her there as a young person with a biotechnology degree and the world ahead of her. \u201cThis is something I wouldn\u2019t want to miss in my life in future, even if I leave here.\u201d\\nA proposed Leeds-based urban cohousing project, Chapeltown Cohousing, is now working to make its members representative of the community, with rented units and quotas for minority groups, but diversity often proves difficult for rural communities, despite the lip- service many pay to opening out to BAME and less physically able members. Quite apart from capital and labour demands, there\u2019s a cultural expectation to contend with, says Stevens-Wood. \u201cYou need a certain approach to life to live in a commune. At heart this is a white, middle-class dream.\u201d\\nFor all of the challenges, the applicants keep coming. Bergholt Hall is fielding hundreds of applicants for its two available units and Heartwood, Canon Frome Court and Redfield are currently closed to new applicants, although they are receiving inquiries from as far afield as Hong Kong. \u201cMany will be disappointed,\u201d says Chris Coates. \u201cBut some will break ground on new projects. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve called the community diggers and dreamers, we\u2019ve always been a mixture of the practically minded and utopianists.\u201d\\nStevens-Wood hopes the growing interest in alternatives to nuclear family dwelling will prompt overdue changes to English housing policy, \u201cso it\u2019s less laser-focused on nuclear families and home ownership\u201d. For Fromer, sharing labour and resources as a communard is as good for the planet as it is our sanity. \u201cThis is a much cheaper way of living that gives you the good life yet frees you up to work differently and work less,\u201d he says. \u201cWhether you\u2019re 20 or 60, that\u2019s a pretty good deal.\u201d\\nFindhorn and Erraid are open to short stays.

But arguably the most powerful environmental changes you can make as an individual involve your finances, whether it\u2019s the cash in your current account or the money you are saving for retirement.\\nResearch issued this week by the ethical bank Triodos found that almost 20 million Britons plan to do their bit to live a greener lifestyle this year. But it added: \u201cFew recognise the impact that switching their finances to greener suppliers can have.\u201d\\nIn part, that is because of the scale of the sums of money involved. For example, there is an estimated \u00a33tn invested in UK pensions, and Richard Curtis\u2019s Make My Money Matter campaign claims that moving your retirement savings to sustainable funds \u201ccan be 27 times as effective at reducing your carbon footprint than eating less meat, using public transport, reducing water use and flying less combined\u201d.\\nThe good news for anyone who wants to make a difference is that there are lots of green and ethical options out there.\\nThis is a good place to start for those looking to make a positive change.\\nIf you want to be sure your money isn\u2019t financing fossil fuels or other controversial industries, you may want to consider moving to a bank such as Triodos, which \u201conly lends to organisations that positively affect people\u2019s lives, protect the planet or build strong communities\u201d.\\nThe Triodos current account can be operated online and via an app, comes with an eco-friendly contactless debit Mastercard (it is made from a plastic substitute derived from renewable sources) and offers an overdraft of up to \u00a32,000. But a stumbling block for some will be the \u00a33 monthly account fee, or the fact that Triodos doesn\u2019t have any high street branches.\\nTriodos is highly rated by Ethical Consumer, an independent, not-for-profit co-operative that reviews companies and products.\\nAccording to Ethical Consumer, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, NatWest, Santander and the TSB owner, Sabadell, are among the big names that continue to provide finance for, or invest in, fossil fuel companies.\\nIt adds that of the high street banks, the Co-operative Bank is the only one that has expressly prohibited support for fossil fuels. The Co-op Bank is famous for its customer-led ethical policy but some will be uneasy about the fact that it is majority-owned by a group of US hedge funds and fund managers.\\nSome will favour a building society because they are owned by members, not shareholders, and have a strong tradition of helping people to buy their own home.\\nBecky and Roy Francomb, aged 55 and 61 respectively, recently decided they wanted to move their bank accounts to somewhere more ethical. They were both with NatWest but were unhappy about its financial links with fossil fuel companies. They considered Triodos but ended up plumping for Nationwide building society because there is a branch in Seaford in East Sussex, where they live.\\nMuch of the above also applies to savings accounts \u2013 however, you will find there is a lot more choice. There are dozens of building societies to pick between, including the Ecology, which has a focus on sustainable living, currently offers easy access, cash Isa and regular savings accounts paying 0.2%, 0.45% and 1.1% respectively.\\nMeanwhile, Triodos has a range of accounts including a one-year fixed-rate savings bond paying 0.4% and a junior cash Isa (for those saving for a child) currently paying 1.5%.\\nCharity Bank lends to charities and social enterprises and has notice accounts paying up to 0.5%, and fixed-rate bonds paying up to 0.75%.\\nThere are also scores of credit unions. To find ones that may suit you, go to findyourcreditunion.co.uk.\\nNS&I (aka National Savings) has been slashing rates lately but may still appeal to some because its mission is \u201cproviding cost-effective financing for government and the public good\u201d.\\nCampaigners argue that a good chunk of the money invested in UK pensions supports industries that are harming people and the planet.\\nThe Francombs recently worked with ethical financial advice firm the Path to transfer some of their pension cash from conventional funds to ones that align with the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals.\\nBecky, who has just taken early retirement from the NHS, where she worked as a project manager, is a member of Extinction Rebellion along with her husband. They have both taken part in a number of actions and have both been arrested.\\n\u201cAs environmental activists, we didn\u2019t want our pensions invested in anything that was causing harm \u2013 fossil fuels, weapons, anything like that,\u201d she says.\\n\u201cWe do try to live sustainably \u2013 we no longer fly, have a mainly plant-based diet, and cycle instead of drive wherever possible \u2013 but, to me, moving our pensions is the most responsible thing we can do.\u201d\\nRoy officially retired from his job as a community family worker this week and had a lump sum with Standard Life, which he has transferred.\\nThe couple\u2019s cash is now in a range of funds operated by companies such as Baillie Gifford (its Positive Change Fund), Fidelity (Sustainable Water & Waste Fund) and Royal London (Sustainable Leaders), where the top holdings include the electric car manufacturer Tesla and the US biotech firm and Covid-19 vaccine maker Moderna.\\nDavid Macdonald, the founder of the Path, believes this is by far the best way individuals can help the environment. \u201cWithout checking exactly how and where pension funds are invested, people could be propping up companies that support fossil fuel developments, deforestation and those involved in warfare,\u201d he says.\\nMost workplace pension schemes automatically default members into a prescribed fund, although many offer an ethical or sustainable fund option and will allow employees to allocate some or all of their money to that.\\nIf you are unhappy with the options available, you could contact the trustees of your workplace pension scheme to ask how much of your money is invested in \u2013 for example \u2013 fossil fuels, if there is a divestment option (where money is moved out of things such as oil, coal and gas companies) and, if not, could one be set up.\\nChoosing ethical funds has definitely paid off for investors. Data from the investment firm AJ Bell shows that the average 10-year total return from UK non-ethical funds stood at 81% at the end of September 2020, while for UK ethical funds it was 104%. The top-performing ethical fund over the 10 years, with a 196% return, was Royal London Sustainable Leaders.\\nThe number of funds available is growing all the time. However, as each individual has their own views about the companies and sectors they are happy to support with their cash, and how much risk they are willing to accept, it is a good idea to talk to a financial adviser.\\nThere are also a number of ethical investment platforms that typically allow people to invest directly in bonds or shares issued by charities and businesses. They include Ethex, Abundance and Triodos\u2019s crowdfunding site.\\nIt used to be pretty much only Ecology building society that was selling green mortgages but there are now a few lenders offering them.\\nFor example, last June, Saffron building society launched the Retro Fit Mortgage, which rewards borrowers with a rate reduction if they carry out work that improves a property\u2019s energy efficiency, and Nationwide has a similar offer for additional borrowing.

While John Major refused to condemn the tests, President Clinton had expressed regret.\\nThe tests \u2013 which all exceeded the size of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs \u2013 soured links with France\u2018s closest neighbours, including Germany and Italy.\\nBut France claimed that threats of boycotts \u2013 especially from Scandinavia and Germany \u2013 had rarely been carried through. The \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace indicated yesterday that Mr Chirac\u2019s visit to Japan \u2013 cancelled last autumn \u2013 looked likely to go ahead.\\nDuring the testing campaign at Moruroa and Fangataufa atolls, French naval vessels clashed with Greenpeace campaigners, confiscating their equipment and arresting crew members. As a result, no environmental campaigners were present for the final two tests.\\n29 January 1996\\nHaving exploded what may possibly be the last in its current series of nuclear tests at Muroroa at the weekend, France should now stick to its word and turn its attention to banning them. Outlawing nuclear tests has been on the international agenda for four decades but little progress has been made since Kennedy and Khrushchev failed to do a deal back in 1963. Yet, if the political will is there, the 1996 session of the Conference on Disarmament, now getting down to brass tacks in Geneva, should still be the forum for finally achieving a comprehensive test ban treaty. The signs are certainly more promising than ever before: France and the US, followed by Britain, have declared themselves ready to accept what the scientists call \u201czero-yield\u201d testing, foregoing the Nevada desert and Pacific atolls for the computer simulation techniques they need to maintain their arsenals. Russia, observing a testing moratorium, is expected to follow suit.\\nChina, with less advanced weapons than other members of the nuclear club, is the next problem. Its continued insistence on \u201cpeaceful nuclear explosions,\u201d ostensibly for civil engineering purposes, may be tactical. But Beijing\u2019s current truculence is worrying and no one will relax in Geneva until it too has come on board. The timing of one of its two tests last year \u2013 just days after pledging \u201cutmost restraint\u201d during negotiations on the indefinite extension of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty \u2013 was deliberate nose-thumbing.\\nOutside the club some countries are bridling at the anxiety of the nuclear powers to pursue the test ban without making concessions on disarmament. India has linked progress on a global treaty to negotiations this year on eliminating all nuclear weapons within a specified time. Yet as a \u201cthreshold state\u201d (along with Pakistan and Israel) that wishes to maintain its capability to manufacture weapons, its position may be more about bargains than principles.\\nThe US and Britain insist there should be no linkage between the treaty and future moves on nuclear disarmament. \u201cHolding one important goal hostage for another is a sure way to fail at both,\u201d conference delegates were told last week by John Holum, director of the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. Incremental progress in such a high-risk area is a sensible way to proceed. But since no one pretends that a test ban treaty will in itself eliminate nuclear weapons, some signal should be given of readiness to move further. Australia is trying to bridge gaps in Geneva while its own Canberra commission of international nuclear experts is sending out the simple but compelling message: disarmament cannot wait for ever.\\nBy Martin Walker in Washington\n  18 June 1996\\nFrance has formally joined Britain in the inner circle of the United States-led nuclear club, signing an agreement to share test and other research data. The deal is intended to ensure the survival of the three countries\u2019 warheads long after a comprehensive test-ban treaty (CTB) comes into force.\\nFor France, it represents another crucial step away from the Gaullist tradition of an independent nuclear deterrent, towards the British pattern of retaining nuclear status through almost complete dependence upon the US.\\nThe agreement \u2013 like President Jacques Chirac\u2019s decision to rejoin Nato\u2019s inner councils and military consultancy committees \u2013 is of symbolic importance for France, which for 30 years tried to steer an independent nuclear and strategic course. The US made the agreement to ensure French adherence to President Bill Clinton\u2019s plan for the CTB.\\nThe deal foreshadows more modest US research agreements with Russia, China and Israel to bring them into the CTB regime. Mr Clinton has already formally offered to share some US technology with Russia to help police a CTB regime, and the defence secretary, William Perry, made a similar offer to China.\\nIf the CTB goes ahead as planned by the White House, the result will be a commonwealth of nuclear powers, in which the US would play the commanding role through its dominance of the test and research data.\\nDuring the later years of the cold war, many smaller powers argued that the US and Soviet Union had a common interest in maintaining their nuclear predominance and their quasi-duopoly, despite their political differences.\\nAt the heart of the new agreement with France is a series of computer models which allows nuclear powers to have it both ways: to give up testing, while remaining confident that the bombs and warheads in stock will work.\\nThe models re-enact the events that take place inside a nuclear weapon as it explodes, and use the data collected from the 1,054 nuclear tests carried out by the US over the past 50 years.\\nOn 13 June last year, Mr Chirac had announced \u201cseven or eight\u201d tests to satisfy the needs of a new generation of ZX missiles and to fine-tune the TN-75 warhead which is to equip French M-45 missiles.\\n* Jim Bolger, the New Zealand prime minister, welcomed the announcement, but said that South Pacific countries would be wary of France for years. He pointed out that France had ended tests under Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, only to resume them last year under Mr Chirac.\\nBy Thierry Cayol in Apt \n 17 September 1996\\nFrance ended a 25-year doomsday watch yesterday, shutting down 18 land-based nuclear missiles at a launch base under the Provence countryside and limiting its nuclear defence to weapons in submarines and bombers.\\n\u201cWe are turning a page in history,\u201d said the air force chief of staff, General Jean Rannou, at a ceremony at St Christol, the headquarters of the First Strategic Missiles Group. \u201cThis has not been 25 wasted years but 25 years of peace.\u201d\\nClosing down the base on the Plateau d\u2019Albion in south-east France is part of defence spending cuts ordered by the president, Jacques Chirac. Mr Chirac decided last year to close the site, but the news was overshadowed by his simultaneous announcement, to much protest, that France was resuming nuclear tests in the South Pacific.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29ee7b95089d9bafb573576c2e786866eb47f321/0_207_5216_3130/master/5216.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "A French nuclear test explosion in Mururoa atoll, French Polynesia, in the southern Pacific Ocean. 1971.

My friend and colleague Bob Grose, who has died aged 71, was one of those people.\\nHe did historically important work on HIV/Aids for the World Health Organization (WHO) in Africa, and on polio, HIV and leprosy for the Overseas Development Administration (ODA, later DfID) in India. Writing for War on Want in the mid-1980s, Bob was one of the first to predict that truckers would be high-risk vectors for the HIV epidemic in Africa. He was quickly snapped up by the WHO\u2019s Global Programme on Aids (later UNAids) in Geneva, where he worked from 1987 to 1992 as a technical adviser. He was ahead of his time, mobilising community groups in Africa to raise awareness of the epidemic: a focus of UNAids to this day.\\nAs the ODA\u2019s senior health and population adviser (1992-99), he oversaw several huge projects: the eradication of polio (every year more than 100 million children were immunised in a single day); the launch of India\u2019s efforts to combat the HIV epidemic; and the elimination of leprosy. All of these stories have happy endings: polio has been eradicated in India, HIV is well controlled and 200,000 people were cured of leprosy on his watch. Bob is remembered by his colleagues there as a consummate professional, kind, wickedly funny, with a complete absence of ego.\\nBob was born in his grandmother\u2019s nursing home in Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, to Nicholas, an auctioneer, and Kathleen (nee Rushworth), a physiotherapist, although the family lived in Fowey, Cornwall. He attended Truro school before qualifying as a chartered surveyor at the College of Estate Management in Kensington, London. He travelled a good deal before doing a master\u2019s in international administration at Cornell.\\nIt was in 1983, during an early posting to Yemen, that Bob met Jane Springham, who was working as a nurse at a small clinic on the Red Sea coast. They married in 1988.\\nBob was determined to raise his young family near the Cornish countryside where he grew up, so in 1999 they moved from India to a farmhouse in Brownston in the South Hams, Devon. Bob spent the final decade of his career at HLSP, an international health consulting firm. When he retired in 2014, he became deeply committed to climate activism, and was arrested as part of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s demonstrations in April 2019. The couple moved to Totnes when Jane retired three years ago.\\nBob was fearsomely fit. He performed a seven-minute plank during a family lockdown competition and thought nothing of a 20-mile kayaking trip. In Jane\u2019s words, \u201che died as he lived, cycling up a hill on a mountain bike, covered in mud, with a smile on his face.

The HAC said it hoped early commitments from countries such as Colombia, Costa Rica, Nigeria, Pakistan, Japan and Canada would ensure it formed the basis of the UN agreement.\\nElizabeth Maruma Mrema, the executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, welcomed the pledge but cautioned: \u201cIt is one thing to commit, but quite different to deliver. But when we have committed, we must deliver. And with concerted efforts, we can collectively deliver.\u201d\\nThe announcement at the One Planet summit, which also saw pledges to invest billions of pounds in the Great Green Wall in Africa and the launch of a new sustainable finance charter called the Terra Carta by Prince Charles, was met with scepticism from some campaigners. Greta Thunberg tweeted: \u201cLIVE from #OnePlanetSummit in Paris: Bla bla nature Bla bla important Bla bla ambitious Bla bla green investments\u2026\u201d\\nAs part of the HAC announcement, the UK environment minister Zac Goldsmith said: \u201cWe know there is no pathway to tackling climate change that does not involve a massive increase in our efforts to protect and restore nature. So as co-host of the next Climate Cop, the UK is absolutely committed to leading the global fight against biodiversity loss and we are proud to act as co-chair of the High Ambition Coalition.\\n\u201cWe have an enormous opportunity at this year\u2019s biodiversity conference in China to forge an agreement to protect at least 30% of the world\u2019s land and ocean by 2030. I am hopeful our joint ambition will curb the global decline of the natural environment, so vital to the survival of our planet.\u201d\\nHowever, despite support for the target from several countries, many indigenous activists have said that increasing protected areas for nature could result in land grabs and human rights violations. The announcement may also concern some developing countries who are keen for ambitious commitments on finance and sustainable development as part of the Kunming agreement, not just conservation.\\nUnlike its climate equivalent, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity covers three issues: the sustainable use of nature, sharing benefits from genetic resources, and conservation. The three pillars of the treaty can clash with each other and richer, developed countries have been accused of focusing too much on conservation while ignoring difficult choices on agriculture and providing finance for poorer nations to meet targets.\\nThe HAC, currently co-chaired by France, Costa Rica and the UK, was formed in 2019 following the success of a similar climate body that spurred ambitious international action before the Paris agreement. By promoting action on biodiversity loss, it is hoped early commitments from the HAC will ensure a successful agreement for nature.\\nOver the last decade, the world has failed to meet a single target to stem the destruction of wildlife and life-sustaining ecosystems.\\nOn Monday, leaders from around the world met in person and virtually at the One Planet summit in Paris to discuss the biodiversity crisis, promoting agroecology and the relationship between human health and nature. Boris Johnson, Angela Merkel and Justin Trudeau addressed the event, which also included statements from UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, and the Chinese vice-premier Han Zheng .\\nThe UK government has also committed \u00a33bn of UK international climate finance to supporting nature and biodiversity over the next five years.\\nJohnson told the event: \u201cWe are destroying species and habitat at an absolutely unconscionable rate. Of all the mammals in the world, I think I am right in saying that 96% of mammals are now human being or livestock that human beings rely upon.\\n\u201cThat is, in my view, a disaster. That\u2019s why the UK has pledged to protect 30% of our land surface and marine surface. Of the 11.6bn that we\u2019ve consecrated to climate finance initiatives, we are putting \u00a33bn to protecting nature.\u201d\\nThe funding was welcomed by conservation and environmental organisations, including the RSPB and Greenpeace, but there were questions about the scale of the funding and whether it came at the cost of international aid.\\n\u201cIncreasing funds to protect and enhance nature is critical to help secure success at the global biodiversity conference in China this year. Siphoning off cash from funds already committed to tackling the climate crisis simply isn\u2019t enough,\u201d said Greenpeace UK\u2019s head of politics, Rebecca Newsom.\\n\u201cThis announcement raises concerns that the UK\u2019s shrinking aid budget is being repurposed to pay for nature and biodiversity. As important as these are, the first priority of overseas aid should be the alleviation of poverty,\u201d said Oxfam\u2019s senior policy adviser on Climate Change, Tracy Carty.\\nThis article was amended on 12 January 2021 to better reflect that the High Ambition Coalition (formed 2011) and the High Ambition Coalition for People and Nature (formed 2019) are separate organisations.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14407f1e32016da5f54e3b02d7f14c477ec9e1df/0_122_4704_2822/master/4704.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Whales"]], "author": ["Patrick Greenfield", "Fiona Harvey"], "date": "2021-01-11"}}
