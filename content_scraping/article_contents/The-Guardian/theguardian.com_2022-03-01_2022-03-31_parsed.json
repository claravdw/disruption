I\u200bt\u2019s \u200ba sexy cuddle\u2019", "subtitle": null, "text": "The actor on growing up on a canal boat, her noisy Buddhist chanting and what\u2019s next for her character, Eloise\\nClaudia Jessie Peyton, 31, was born in Birmingham and raised on a canal boat by her mother. She was home-schooled and has no formal qualifications but was talent-spotted while trying standup and recruited by a local theatre company. Her TV roles include Line of Duty, Doctor Who and Vanity Fair. She plays Eloise, the eponymous family\u2019s second oldest daughter, in the hit Netflix period drama Bridgerton, which returns on Friday.\\nWhere do we find your character Eloise as Bridgerton returns?She\u2019s making her debut on the London social scene. Anyone who\u2019s a fan of the show can probably predict how she responds \u2013 with gritted teeth and many an eye roll. Eloise is only 18; I\u2019m 31 and can barely respond to text messages, let alone be presented to the Queen, then ultimately married off. Finding love isn\u2019t even in her top 10 list of desires. She wants autonomy, to earn her own money and make her own choices.\\nIs she a proto-feminist?Hers is the explicit feminist narrative throughout the piece. It\u2019s skilfully peppered throughout all the characters, with even the boys questioning their roles, but Eloise is the one who\u2019s got a megaphone, shouting: \u201cThis is rubbish!\u201d\\nWe see her reading Mary Wollstonecraft in the early episodes. Are you a bookworm too?I\u2019ve always had my head in a book. I\u2019ve just invested in a secondhand Kindle, in fact, because I live on a canal boat and I can\u2019t just keep adding to my book collection or we\u2019d sink.\\nWhat were your formative books?One of the first books I remember being given was Little Women by my nan. I read that six times in rapid succession. I\u2019m a member of Extinction Rebellion, so went through a big George Monbiot phase. I also read Japanese authors like Ryu Murakami. In the Miso Soup is the darkest novel I\u2019ve ever read. One chapter gave me palpitations.\\nBridgerton became Netflix\u2019s top show in 76 countries. What\u2019s the appeal?It\u2019s not bleak or dark or intense. It\u2019s a bit of a cuddle. A sexy cuddle, mind you, but a cuddle nonetheless.\\nWill Eloise get her sexy moment?I wonder what that would be like? A sexy-but-funny montage, maybe. It would be cool to see Eloise awaken and get in touch with that side of herself. In season one, she didn\u2019t even know how babies were made.\\nEloise is best friends with Penelope Featherington, played by Nicola Coughlan. What\u2019s your relationship like off-screen?Nicola always says it\u2019s the other way around. In Bridgerton, Eloise talks at Penelope a lot of the time; in real life, I\u2019m more introverted and Nicola does most of the chatting. We were the first two people cast. I remember seeing our head shots next to each other on a wall and thinking \u2013 \u201cCool!\u201d \u2013 because Nicola\u2019s incredible.\\nDidn\u2019t Nicola stab you with a parasol during your first scene?Correct, she drew blood. Nicola had heels on and kept falling over. I tried to catch her and the silver spokes of the umbrella went bosh, straight into my hand. I managed to keep it away from my costume but bloodied my white glove. It was a blood oath. That\u2019s why we\u2019re so close now.\\nWhat do you make of Eloise\u2019s big queer fanbase?I can see why she connects with people, because she\u2019s one of a kind within the show. She\u2019s quite modern, so closer to the audience in attitude and spirit. It\u2019s beautiful that the queer community identify with her. But I don\u2019t experience a lot of the love because I\u2019m not on social media.\\nWhy not?It\u2019s my Kate Bush inclinations to be slightly reclusive. When I figured out I wanted to act, that became my mission. But there are parts of the industry that don\u2019t chime with my natural disposition. In order to maintain happiness, I have to eliminate certain things. With my anxious tendencies, it wouldn\u2019t bode well so I steer clear.\\nEloise never looks comfortable in her finery but do you enjoy wearing the regency costumes?I mean, it\u2019s the nicest I\u2019ll ever look. I\u2019m not a fancy dresser at home. Living on a boat means I get covered in oil, coal, wood chips, dust, canal water, diesel. There\u2019s no point dressing up, so I love getting to do it on-set.\\nIs it true that you only wear secondhand clothes?It\u2019s six years since I shopped on the high street. I\u2019ll buy new underwear but ethically sourced and mostly recycled materials. Otherwise, it\u2019s strictly thrift and vintage shops.\\nWhat\u2019s the appeal of living on a boat?I loved it as a kid and that stuck with me. When I moved to London, I lived in various terrifying places, scraping money together for rent. I thought I\u2019d never get a mortgage for a house so started saving, slowly but surely, for a canal boat. It\u2019s one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made. I love cruising, the small spaces, the smell of the engine. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted.\\nYou were raised by a working-class single mother. How did that shape you?It\u2019s about expectations. Mine were never high. I worked very hard but never expected to make it. Even now, I leave auditions and think: \u201cWell, I\u2019m clearly not going to get that.\u201d When I do, I\u2019m pleasantly surprised. My mum cleaned houses to pay for my dance classes or music lessons or my brother\u2019s activities. She\u2019d do anything so we could have a shot. I\u2019m very aware of where I\u2019m from and how hard life can be. That will never leave me. It\u2019s also made me a nester. I don\u2019t want for much; I love just pottering around on the boat.\\nHow come you were home-schooled?School wasn\u2019t a nice environment for me; I had a hard time. I left at 14 and my poor mum home-schooled me while doing cleaning jobs. She\u2019d teach me maths while ironing someone else\u2019s clothes. Remarkable, really, but I learned better one on one, away from social pressures.\\nIs there a class gap in the acting profession?Growing up on a canal boat or council estate, I wasn\u2019t going to the theatre. An acting career never crossed my mind. It\u2019s hard to have beautiful dreams when you\u2019ve got to focus on earning money, paying rent and practicalities. But those voices are important. Expressing yourself and having an emotional outlet is so valuable. I didn\u2019t train, don\u2019t have any qualifications, didn\u2019t make all the right choices. It\u2019s against the odds that I\u2019m here now.\\nYou were Thandiwe Newton\u2019s sidekick, DC Jodie Taylor, in Line of Duty. How was that?When it aired, my friend sent me an article titled: Why DC Jodie Taylor is just the absolute worst! [laughs]. I love Thandiwe. We\u2019re still in contact and she\u2019s a beautiful woman. And I learned so much from Vicky McClure\u2019s ability to be so naturalistic. [Showrunner] Jed Mercurio would tell me: \u201cDon\u2019t really act, just say the words.\u201d That taught me to rein it in.\\nWhat role does Buddhism play in your life?I\u2019m one of the noisy Buddhists. I don\u2019t meditate, I chant \u2013 \u201cNam Myoho Renge Kyo\u201d, the same as Tina Turner. Me and Tina T, no big deal. I did it as a kid with my mum and auntie but found it awkward when I hit my teens. Then I was 17, very sad, struggling with my brain, and my auntie was like: \u201cRight, let\u2019s commit to chanting.\u201d It made me feel better and I haven\u2019t stopped since. It\u2019s the anchor of my life. I wouldn\u2019t be here without it. Now I have responsibilities within the Buddhist community. I look after all the young women who practise it across the Midlands. It\u2019s a job I do very gladly.\\nWhat projects are in the pipeline for you?I can\u2019t talk much about it yet but I\u2019m going to Sydney for two months, working on something I\u2019m very excited about. Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s very different to Bridgerton. Then I\u2019m back for Bridgerton season three.\\nAre you signed up for season four as well?Hope so! I think I am. There\u2019s much more to come from Eloise, so I\u2019m definitely sticking around.\\nBridgerton season two streams on Netflix from 25 March", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03319160b6d506d5f6822f8162ccea26e1bd178c/74_924_2312_1387/master/2312.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Claudia Jessie"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31bea181acb60f8e4929a6ac9183d4acfd910c7c/0_0_3600_2404/master/3600.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Nicola Coughlan as Penelope Featherington, left, and Claudia Jessie as Eloise Bridgerton in Bridgerton."]], "author": ["Michael Hogan"], "date": "2022-03-20"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/04/ukraine-war-european-reappraisal-energy-supplies-coal-renewables": {"title": "Ukraine war prompts European reappraisal of its energy supplies", "subtitle": null, "text": "Analysis: Russian invasion could speed up renewables transition \u2013 or lead to disastrous return to coal\\nVladimir Putin is using Russia\u2019s hold over fossil fuel supplies to Europe as \u201ca political and economic weapon\u201d in the war in Ukraine, the world\u2019s foremost energy adviser has said, presenting western governments with crucial questions over how they face down the threat to democracy while also heading off climate disaster.\\nFatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, said: \u201cNobody is under any illusions any more. Russia\u2019s use of its natural gas resources as an economic and political weapon shows Europe needs to act quickly to be ready to face considerable uncertainty over Russian gas supplies next winter.\u201d\\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has prompted European governments, including the UK\u2019s, to make a frantic reappraisal of their energy supplies \u2013 one that arguably should have come much sooner. The first outcome has been a fresh resolve in some countries \u2013 including from the UK business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng \u2013 to push for more renewable energy generation and energy efficiency to cut dependence on fossil fuels.\\nKwarteng\u2019s intervention \u2013 \u201cThe long-term solution is obvious: gas is more expensive than renewable energy, so we need to move away from gas,\u201d he tweeted \u2013 was unexpectedly firm, cheering green campaigners who had feared that rightwing voices in the Tory party who have sought to make scrapping the net zero target a \u201cculture war\u201d issue were in the ascendant.\\nDoug Parr, the chief scientist for Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cKwasi Kwarteng has clocked it. Our dependence on gas is a problem, and warmer homes powered by renewables are the cheapest and quickest solution. Kwarteng must convince chancellor Rishi Sunak that we need a masterplan, and the money to get the UK off gas. We need to insulate our homes, roll out heat pumps and renewable power to rapidly address Putin\u2019s grip on European gas markets, our sky-high energy bills, and the climate crisis unfolding before our eyes.\u201d\\nGermany has announced plans to ramp up energy efficiency and renewable energy, and is considering delaying the closure of its remaining nuclear power stations. France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron called for a \u201crenaissance\u201d of low-carbon nuclear power to secure domestic energy supplies. In the US, Joe Biden used his state of the union speech to bang the drum again for his proposed clean energy stimulus programme.\\nPaul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser now with the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington, said: \u201cThe Russian invasion of Ukraine greatly increases the likelihood that the US Congress will pass huge new clean energy incentives this year because of an increased focus on energy security. Such a massive expansion of zero-emission US energy will also free up more US natural gas to flow to Europe to displace Russian gas, which has far higher fugitive emissions of methane. Together these actions would represent a significant improvement not only in global energy geopolitics, but result in major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions as well.\u201d\\nBut as the war in Ukraine continues to rage, there is also a significant danger that \u2013 particularly if Putin goes further and cuts off gas supplies \u2013 governments could pivot the opposite way. As the IEA noted: \u201cOther avenues are available to the EU if it wishes or needs to reduce reliance on Russian gas even more quickly \u2026 The major near-term option would involve switching away from gas consumption in the power sector via increased use of Europe\u2019s coal-fired fleet, or by using alternative fuels such as oil within existing gas-fired power plants.\u201d\\nThe decision may be taken by private-sector companies with coal-fired power stations that were recently closed or scheduled to close and could be brought back on stream quickly, said Richard Howard, the research director at Aurora Energy Research. \u201cThe high gas prices being seen in the market will in any case create an economic incentive for generators to shift from gas power stations towards coal,\u201d he said. A further complication is that Europe also depends on Russia for coal.\\nIn the US, the opportunities to export gas from fracking, and coal for power stations, may also expand temptingly as fossil fuel prices rise, and to fill the gaps that open up as countries move away from Russian supplies.\\nThen there is the question of how much consumers will stand. Petrol prices in the US, as in many places around the world, are now at the highest in a decade and still rising. Phillip Braun, a professor of finance at Northwestern University in the US, said: \u201cAmerican consumers need to accept that rising gas prices are a necessary cost to help the Ukrainian people in the midst of their profound crisis.\u201d Whether consumers will continue to pay this price for democracy has not yet been tested.\\nAfter years of grindingly slow progress in shifting away from coal and oil, if countries were to resume fossil fuel use under the impact of Russia\u2019s war, it would spell disaster for attempts to cut greenhouse gas emissions. This week the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned of global devastation already under way and set to intensify if temperatures rise further, in what scientists termed \u201cthe bleakest warning yet\u201d.\\nTim Crosland, the director of Plan B, a climate campaign group, said the IPCC report showed that reaching for more fossil fuels as a response to Putin would only put the world in greater peril. \u201cThere is no option of ramping up fossil fuel production as a counter to Putin,\u201d he said. \u201cA strategy for deescalation of the war in Ukraine can and must be integrated with a strategy for the urgent and radical reduction of carbon emissions, starting with an end to new fossil fuel supply projects, as required to limit warming to 1.5C. Separate the two logics [of climate and dealing with the war] and it\u2019s all over.\u201d\\nThese issues will come into sharp focus at the next UN climate meeting, Cop27, due to be held in Egypt in November. So far preparations have been unaffected, and diplomats privately note that climate negotiations have carried on through 30 years of political upheavals, including wars among UN members.\\nBut the key questions over energy policy will need to be resolved long before countries meet again on the climate. Given the time it takes to change energy systems, as the IEA made clear, governments must prepare now for what next winter will bring.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3b39b25444c6872c81850a3d036cf3bf9c7ea74/0_53_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Operations at Razrez Inskoy coal enterprise in the Kemerovo region of Russia."]], "author": ["Fiona Harvey"], "date": "2022-03-04"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/05/telegram-app-ukraine-rides-high-thirst-trustworthy-news": {"title": "Telegram: the app at the heart of Ukraine\u2019s propaganda battle", "subtitle": null, "text": "It\u2019s the most popular messaging service in Ukraine, and used by protesters of all kinds. Now it must find a way to make money\\nIn the days after Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of his country, Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, used his Telegram channel to send a defiant video message from the centre of the capital, Kyiv, calling on the nation to unite and resist the Russian attack.\\nThe WhatsApp-like messaging service, co-founded by exiled Russian billionaire brothers Pavel and Nikolai Durov, has become a key weapon in a digital propaganda battle that will ultimately boost its usage and investor profile ahead of a possible $50bn stock market flotation next year.\\nUkraine\u2019s 44-year-old president, a former TV actor and comedian who campaigned over Telegram in the run-up to his landslide victory in the 2019 presidential election, used the service to refute claims that the army had been told to lay down arms, that an evacuation had been ordered \u2013 and to galvanise the populace by proving he would not be leaving the capital.\\nTelegram, which has more than 550 million monthly users globally, is already Ukraine\u2019s most popular messaging app. The service\u2019s much-hyped encryption and its ability to disseminate messages to groups of up to 200,000 \u2013 the limit on Facebook-owned WhatsApp is 256 members \u2013 has seen it dubbed the \u201capp of choice\u201d for terrorists.\\nTelegram was banned in Russia in 2018 after Pavel Durov refused to give the authorities access to its user data. However, the crackdown, which included blocking IP addresses, was easy to circumvent, and the service continued to grow. Russia gave in and lifted the ban in mid-2020.\\nThe app has been adopted as a leading source of news outside state-controlled media, and in the Ukrainian war it has become a 24-hour news lifeline for civilians, journalists and even the military.\\nIt has become the go-to platform for protest groups of all kinds, from Extinction Rebellion to anti-vaccination groups, from the US Capitol rioters to pro-democracy campaigns in states including Russian-allied Belarus, Hong Kong and Iran.\\nBut Telegram\u2019s role in the dissemination of unverified information alarmed the 37-year-old Durov \u2013 who has been called the Russian Mark Zuckerberg, after he founded what is still by far the country\u2019s most popular social network, VKontakte (VK), in 2006.\\nLast weekend, he said he was considering shuttering the service in the \u201ccountries involved\u201d for the duration of the conflict.\\n\u201cWe do not want Telegram to be used as a tool that exacerbates conflicts and incites ethnic hatred,\u201d Durov posted on Sunday.\\nHours later, he changed his mind, following mass requests from users, who said it was their only source of information. \u201cDouble-check and do not take on faith the data that is published in Telegram channels during this difficult period,\u201d Durov advised.\\nJamie MacEwan, media analyst at research service Enders, said. \u201cThis is another example of Telegram being linked to resistance movements. It has very much been part of its reputation over the past couple of years as it has boomed. It is associated with being a safe haven.\u201d\\nDurov is known for occasional eccentric behaviour \u2013 he once threw paper aeroplanes made from bank notes out of VKontakte\u2019s office windows, causing fights in the street below, and he publicly offered Edward Snowden a job. He is now on a mission to make his second tech venture the success story that was ultimately wrested from him first time around.\\nDuring anti-Putin protests in 2012, Durov became hugely popular for refusing to close down groups that were using the social media site to organise marches. Two years later, he was on the receiving end of a hostile investor coup that saw VK appropriated by Mail.Ru group, headed by Russian billionaire and Putin ally Alisher Usmanov. In December, the Kremlin strengthened its grip on the company when Russian insurance company Sogaz, founded by giant Gazprom, took control of VK.\\nDurov sold up and left the business as well as the country, becoming a citizen of St Kitts & Nevis in the Caribbean, after resisting Kremlin pressure to release the data of Ukrainian protest leaders.\\nIt is little surprise that Telegram, which he launched with brother Nikolai in 2013 and is operationally headquartered in Dubai, is built on security and privacy.\\nThe publicity-averse Durov, who has a penchant for dressing all in black nevertheless spends much of his energy criticising the security standards of rivals, most notably world leader WhatsApp.\\nIn recent years security experts have in turn questioned Telegram\u2019s claims of superiority, pointing out that, unlike rivals, it does not offer end-to-end encryption by default over all its messaging options.\\nMoxie Marlinspike, creator of the popular Signal secure messaging app, took to Twitter last week to remind Ukrainians that Telegram is not as encrypted as people think, after what he alleged was a \u201cdecade of misleading marketing and press\u201d.\\nTelegram is the most popular messenger in urban Ukraine. After a decade of misleading marketing and press, most ppl there believe it\u2019s an \u201cencrypted app\u201dThe reality is the opposite-TG is by default a cloud database w/ a plaintext copy of every msg everyone has ever sent/recvd. https://t.co/6eRGIyXyje\\nDurov\u2019s experience at VK left him with an aversion to bringing in outside investors to fund Telegram. With a fortune estimated at over $17bn, he has been able to support it for most of its early life without outside help. But the search for alternative ways to raise the funds necessary to drive growth led him into an ultimately disastrous foray into the world of cryptoassets.\\nIn 2018, Durov embarked on a plan to raise billions through the launch of a cryptocurrency called Grams, a venture that sparked an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US.\\nPre-sales ahead of the planned initial coin offering (ICO), which would have funded a proposed Telegram Open Network (TON) system of apps services and a store of digital and physical goods, drew a rapturous response from an initial select group of investors, raising $1.7bn.\\nBut two years later, Telegram shut TON down and agreed an $18.5m settlement with the SEC, which had argued that Grams bypassed US financing laws. It ordered that the money be returned to investors.\\nThe setback in fundraising has not slowed growth, however: in early 2021, Telegram reported the biggest user boost in its history \u2013 25 million in 72 hours.\\nDurov, who is now also a French citizen, credited the rush of new Telegrammers to an announcement by WhatsApp clarifying its privacy policy relating to data sharing with parent Facebook. Durov added, rather grandiosely: \u201cWe may be witnessing the largest digital migration in human history.\u201d\\nThe WhatsApp policy did not include sharing the content of messages, but it spooked many users, who defected to other platforms anyway: Telegram and Signal were the biggest beneficiaries.\\n\u201cThe increasing downloads of Telegram is [partly] driven by consumers\u2019 growing anxiety over the power of the biggest tech companies, and by privacy concerns,\u201d says Forrester analyst Xiaofeng Wang.\\nA few months after that user boost, Russian business newspaper Vedomosti reported that unnamed sources close to the company claimed a $50bn initial public offering was on the cards by the end of next year.\\nA successful IPO would cement the rise of Telegram, which has begun to make headway on the extremely difficult proposition of making money from the users of messaging services.\\nDurov, who once vowed Telegram would never carry ads, is seeking to monetise the platform through a combination of \u201cprivacy-safe\u201d advertising and sponsorship of channels.\\n\u201cThe timing of the emergence of talk of an IPO is quite telling, coming almost immediately after the early 2021 boom when its user potential started to explode,\u201d says MacEwan at Enders. \u201cI think the momentum they now have, the sheer weight of users, and the fact they are experimenting with \u2018privacy safe\u2019 advertising make them an attractive flotation candidate.\u201d\\nA Telegram spokesman confirmed that the company is pursuing plans for an initial public offering, and that some pre-IPO bonds have been sold with a five-year expiry, but cautioned that the timeline is not certain.\\n\u201cAs for the IPO plans, they will depend on the economic situation at the time,\u201d he said.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8058a18934197dbafebbfde03fbed96f5554004/0_142_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7726bbf2949a0ad4ba77abf0aa34f1604a4939d/0_89_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "A video grab of the defiant message Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy sent on Telegram."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a7cfb446be459c2e70dc34f80c3a7719baa5528/0_177_4600_2761/master/4600.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Telegram logo seen on a mobile phone screen in front of Facebook and Twitter logos"]], "author": ["Mark Sweney"], "date": "2022-03-05"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/09/corfu-whales-stranded-seismic-testing-fossil-fuels": {"title": "Stranding of three whales in Corfu raises alarm over seismic testing for fossil fuels", "subtitle": null, "text": "While cause remains unconfirmed, green groups fear the three whales could be the \u2018tip of iceberg\u2019 with many more animals hurt\\nEnvironmental groups have linked the beaching of three whales in Corfu to seismic testing for oil and gas in the waters off the Greek island.\\nTwo Cuvier\u2019s beaked whales were found stranded at Arillas and Agios Gordios beaches on the west of the island on 20 February. A third beaked whale ran ashore on Agios Gordios beach the day after.\\n\u201cIt took dozens of volunteers over five hours using rudimentary ropes to hoist the whales back in the sea,\u201d said local vet Nastazia Koronaki, who helped coordinate the rescue efforts.\\nBeached whales are not unknown in Greece, but for three healthy whales to be stranded on the same coastline within such a short space of time is unusual, said Koronaki.\\nWhile it has not been established what caused the whales to become stranded, environmental groups suspect the beachings were connected to SW Cook, a ship commissioned by oil company Hellenic Petroleum, which has been conducting testing in the Ionian Sea off the Corfu coastline. This region includes the Hellenic trench and the Ionian Sea archipelago, which have been designated important marine mammal areas.\\nSeismic testing is a method of oil and gas exploration that involves continuously blasting the seafloor with airguns to map the fossil fuels below. These blasts can reach more than 250 decibels. The effect of these sound levels on marine mammals is \u201clike a bomb repeatedly going off in their home every 10 seconds \u2013 a home they can\u2019t flee\u201d, according to US non-profit the National Resources Defense Council.\\nResearch has linked seismic testing to a range of negative impacts in marine animals, including hearing impairment, difficulties with feeding and interference with communication. In beaked whales, which are deep divers, studies have found links between seismic testing and decompression sickness.\\nThe whale beachings were \u201cprobably only the tip of the iceberg,\u201d said Nicolas Entrup, director of international relations at the non-profit OceanCare. \u201cMany more animals, and not only whales, may have been harmed. Animals exposed to this intense sound may get killed and sink to the bottom of the sea.\u201d\\nLast month, the two environmental organisations, along with other non-profits, wrote to the Greek prime minister calling for a halt to seismic testing until the cause of the whale beachings can be established. Greenpeace also sent its ship, Rainbow Warrior III, to monitor SW Cook.\\nAccording to reports, the seismic surveys were paused after the beachings and the SW Cook has now left Greece, said Dimitris Ibrahim, climate officer at WWF Greece.\\nHellenic Petroleum did not respond to requests for comment.\\nThe beachings have also raised awareness of the larger issue of oil and gas exploration in the Ionian Sea. Photos and videos of stranded whales spread quickly on social media and questions have been asked in parliament by Greece\u2019s opposition Syriza party.\\nA protest on Corfu brought together environmental activists and tourism industry workers. \u201cPeople are really scared because we live from tourism, and this could destroy the local economy,\u201d said Giannis Gasteratos, one of those protesting on the island.\\nThe Ionian Sea is notoriously deep and tectonically active, which could make any potential oil and gas extraction extremely risky.\\nEven if oil and gas reserves were detected, Greece would not have the infrastructure to exploit them until about 2030, said Ibrahim. \u201cIt is crazy that we are even considering extracting fossil fuels that far in the future.

But that\u2019s not what happened. Carbon emissions have now rebounded to their highest level in human history, as, in response to the Covid downturn, politicians relied on coal to reboot their economies.\\nThe same \u201ccrackpot realism\u201d manifests in relation to Ukraine.\\nAs the British academic Helen Thompson notes, it\u2019s been obvious for decades that \u201caddressing climate change would be constrained by geopolitics, and that choices about which new energy sources to develop would have geopolitical consequences.\u201d\\nThe west\u2019s refusal to quit fossil fuels thus facilitated Russia\u2019s imperial ambitions. Paradoxically, Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has now emboldened those most committed to further pollution.\\nThe Nationals\u2019 Matt Canavan, for instance, say that the war means Australians should \u201cstop trying to save the planet by building a green economy, and instead defend Australia by rebuilding our industrial base.\u201d\\nIf we once hoped that real-world manifestations of the climate emergency would, in and of themselves, force world leaders to change, we should quit kidding ourselves.
