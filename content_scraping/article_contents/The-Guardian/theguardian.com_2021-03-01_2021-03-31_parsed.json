He also avoids meat, likes yoga and supports Extinction Rebellion\\nHedge fund manager Sir Chris Hohn once made a point of telling a high court judge that he was an \u201cunbelievable moneymaker\u201d. This week Hohn proved his point \u2013 definitively \u2013 when it was revealed that he paid himself just shy of \u00a31m-a-day last year.\\nHohn collected $479m (\u00a3343m) in annual dividend payments from his The Children\u2019s Investment (TCI) fund in the biggest ever personal payday in the UK after doubling profits at his Mayfair hedge fund, run from an office a couple of doors down from Louis Vuitton\u2019s flagship store.\\nThe payout \u2013 which works out at \u00a3940,000 for every calendar day of the year, and is nearly 11,000 times the median UK full-time salary \u2013 has shone a fresh spotlight on Hohn, a billionaire who goes to extraordinary lengths to protect his privacy after receiving regular death threats.\\nAs well as making money and picking boardroom fights, Hohn, who was once chancellor Rishi Sunak\u2019s boss at TCI, is one of the nation\u2019s biggest philanthropists.\\nHe has pumped more than \u00a34bn into his personal children\u2019s charity. And in recent years he has taken on a second cause: the climate crisis, promising to use his fund\u2019s $30bn of investments to \u201cforce change on companies who refuse to take their environmental emissions seriously\u201d.\\nWell known in the City and on Wall Street as one of the most aggressive activist investors, it came as little surprise to Hohn\u2019s friends that he was not prepared to wait for governments to take action on climate change.\\nInstead he has pumped money into Extinction Rebellion (XR), the \u201crespectful disruption\u201d campaign that has staged high-profile sit-in protests around the world. When Hohn was revealed as XR\u2019s single biggest donor, he said: \u201cHumanity is aggressively destroying the world with climate change and there is an urgent need for us all to wake up to this fact.\u201d\\nHohn, who has only given a handful of tightly controlled media interviews throughout his career, pleaded with the high court judge overseeing his 2014 divorce from Jamie Cooper-Hohn to ban the media from the courtroom.\\nHowever the request was denied, giving the public a glimpse into the billionaire\u2019s surprisingly modest lifestyle, his motivations for making so much money, and why he didn\u2019t view his wife of 17 years as worthy of half the family fortune.\\nAlthough he was in a fight over a huge amount of money, Hohn said his life\u2019s mission was to give money away. \u201cMy life is actually about charity,\u201d he told the court. \u201cI learned very early on you cannot take money with you. It does not bring you happiness.\u201d\\nHe said he lived a \u201cvery simple lifestyle\u201d, avoids meat and practises yoga. On hearing the evidence, the judge noted that the couple lived a \u201cSwatch lifestyle\u201d not a \u201cjet-set lifestyle\u201d.\\nHohn grew up in Addlestone, Surrey, the son of a Jamaican car mechanic and a legal secretary. He first decided to give money to charity, he has said, while working in the Philippines, where as a 20-year-old he saw children living on a rubbish dump.\\n\u201cI considered being a doctor and working in a caring profession,\u201d Hohn, 54, told the court. \u201c[But] a dream or aspiration without resources is just that.\u201d He compared his ambition to become a philanthropist to other young people who set their hearts on being able to \u201cplay for Chelsea or be a top QC\u201d.\\nHohn studied accounting and economics at Southampton University, where a tutor suggested he go on to study for a masters in business administration at Harvard. He took their advice, and graduated in the top 5% of his class.\\nIt was at a Harvard dinner party that Hohn met Jamie Cooper, who was studying for a masters at the John F Kennedy School of government. They married soon after and took each other\u2019s names officially, but only Jamie used both surnames. They have four children, including a set of triplets.\\nHohn worked for the private equity firm Apax Partners, before moving to the Wall Street hedge fund Perry Capital. Perry\u2019s partners then posted him back to London where he ran the UK division.\\nHe struck out on his own in 2003 setting up his own $500m fund TCI, which quickly attracted investment from some of the world\u2019s top foundations and endowments including the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\\nThe fund appealed to charities and foundations because it was structured so that one-third of management fees would go directly to the Children\u2019s Investment Fund Foundation, a charity set up by the couple and run by Cooper-Hohn.\\nIn an interview with the New York Times to promote the newly launched charity in 2008, Cooper-Hohn dismissed suggestions it had been set up as ploy to soften Hohn\u2019s image as an activist investor unafraid to fight the boards of companies he had invested in.\\nIn a new year card to family, Hohn once wrote he had had an \u201cexceptionally exciting year overthrowing German CEOs\u201d. One opponent \u2013 former Deutsche B\u00f6rse boss Werner Seifert \u2013 was so angry after losing a boardroom battle with Hohn that he wrote a book about it entitled Invasion of the Locusts, where he described Hohn\u2019s style as \u201cpoison\u201d.\\nHohn\u2019s TCI was also instrumental in forcing Dutch bank ABN Amro into the arms of Royal Bank of Scotland in 2007 \u2013 a deal which just months later, when the banking crisis hit, was a key reason RBS had to be bailed out by the UK taxpayer.\\nCooper-Hohn said the foundation \u201cnot about putting a warm and fuzzy face\u201d on TCI. She said knowing that a share of the management fees went to the fund was \u201cvery much about keeping Chris motivated\u201d to produce the highest returns possible.\\nBoth TCI and the foundation flourished. The hedge fund now manages $30bn of investments and is regularly listed among the world\u2019s best-performing funds. Last year\u2019s mega payday was not that exceptional for Hohn. The previous year he was paid \u00a3200m, and accounts filed at Companies House for TCI Fund Management (UK) Limited, which is 100% owned by Hohn, show that it holds total shareholder funds of almost $2bn.\\nThe charity holds almost $6bn of assets and gave away $386m in 2019, according to the latest available accounts. However, the foundation no longer collects one-third of TCI\u2019s management fees, following the couple\u2019s divorce. Instead, Hohn can give to the charity at his discretion.\\nThe divorce reached the high court after Hohn refused to give Cooper-Hohn half of their assets, arguing that the extraordinary wealth he had generated constituted a special contribution to the marriage. He claimed she was only entitled to 25%.\\nHer lawyer said the marriage was \u201cwhat most marriages are: a partnership. How can it be possibly be fair that a couple who have agreed how to run their lives together for the wife to only receive a quarter of the assets?\u201d\\nAfter weeks of arguments \u2013 which included Hohn calling Goldman Sachs bankers \u201cidiots\u201d and describing former Spain and Chelsea striker Fernando Torres as \u201cworthless\u201d \u2013 the judge awarded Cooper-Hohn 36% \u2013 or $530m \u2013 of her former husband\u2019s fortune.\\nCooper-Hohn later won another court battle forcing Hohn\u2019s CIFF charity to pay \u00a3270m to a charity set up by his ex-wife.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/593ccdef561df8aea15481f6abd24b1f72d402d9/0_30_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Sir Chris Hohn with singer Katy Perry"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4817df2d3fded45c60ec362d3d5981717d5f55a5/0_232_5315_3191/master/5315.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "An Extinction Rebellion protest by the elderly"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/624064aad18d3f334e582e432bfb550bd61abab2/0_44_1443_866/master/1443.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Jamie Cooper-Hohn"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f034c54b9302975ec51e1e24bdac700e9762699/0_166_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Werner Seifert, the former chief executive of the German stock exchange"]], "author": ["Rupert Neate"], "date": "2021-03-05"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/mar/28/protest-laws-move-uk-towards-paramilitary-policing-says-former-chief": {"title": "Protest laws move UK towards paramilitary policing, says former chief", "subtitle": null, "text": "Exclusive: Michael Barton, who led Durham force, says government should show common sense after pandemic\\nA former police chief has warned that new protest laws move Britain dangerously towards \u201cparamilitary policing\u201d and that UK ministers are \u201cflexing their muscles via their police forces\u201d like repressive regimes around the world.\\nThe warning from Michael Barton, the former chief constable of Durham comes as policing braces itself for a report expected within the next 48 hours after Metropolitan police officers were accused of heavy-handed tactics at a vigil on Clapham Common for Sarah Everard.\\nScenes of officers grappling with women led to outrage with calls for the resignation of the commissioner, Cressida Dick.\\nThe home secretary ordered a report expected on Monday or Tuesday from Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary. The key question it will answer will be whether the Met\u2019s actions were proportionate or not.\\nAs the new protest laws pass through parliament, Barton and another former senior policing leader, Sir Peter Fahy, told the Guardian they held deep concerns about the dangers the new laws posed for civil liberties already reeling from a year of emergency Covid laws.\\nThe police, crime, sentencing and courts bill, currently passing through parliament, will afford new powers to officers to tackle protests, including measures aimed at static protests and a new offence of \u201cintentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance\u201d, which is in part defined as causing \u201cserious annoyance\u201d or \u201cserious inconvenience\u201d.\\nBarton, was head of crime operations for policing nationally, and led the Durham constabulary until 2019, which inspectors rated as one of the best performing forces in Britain.\\nHe told the Guardian: \u201cI\u2019m not in favour of even more restrictive measures. Surely after an historically unprecedented year-long curfew, in peacetime, the government could show some common sense and gratitude for such incredible forbearance to allow civil liberties to once again flourish. Or are they happy to be linked to the repressive regimes currently flexing their muscles via their police forces?\\n\u201cFortunately, in the UK we are not a paramilitary-style police force. But these powers dangerously edge in that direction. Police chiefs will be seen as the arbiters of what is and is not allowed when it comes to protest. Democracies thrive on protest. This government has condemned what has happened in the Ukraine but those same protesters would fall foul of our new laws.\u201d\\nBarton said the move represented a change in the British style of policing by consent, with officers being \u201ccitizens in uniform\u201d who are part of their communities and not above them \u201cbecause police officers are telling people what to do, not negotiating with them\u201d. He added: \u201cI don\u2019t see anything wrong with the current laws. Protests sometimes means people are inconvenienced.\u201d\\nPolice will be able to impose a start and finish time and set noise limits at static protests and apply these rules to a demonstration by just one person.\\nFahy, the former chief constable of Greater Manchester police and former vice-chair of the police chiefs\u2019 body, said the proposed protest laws were a mistake and posed a danger for policing.\\nHe said lessons from the past suggested danger, citing the quashing this week of 1970s convictions of trade union activists including the actor Ricky Tomlinson as a warning from history.\\n\u201cIt is short-term and politically driven,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a reaction to what happened with Extinction Rebellion and Black Lives Matter [protests], in the same way Ricky Tomlinson was a reaction to the industrial strife of the 1970s. Policing was drawn into a particular stance and pose.\\n\u201cIt reminds me of the miners\u2019 strike when policing was mobilised for a political reason. It took policing a long time to recover. Policing should be very careful not to be drawn into the situation of being arbiters of which protests can go ahead, and become stuck in the middle. The policing of protest can cause long-term damage.\u201d\\nFahy added: \u201cPolicing is not always about the majority, sometimes it is about protecting rights of the minority. I\u2019m not sure a mature democracy should have the police deciding which protests should go ahead.\u201d\\nTheir comments came as at least 10 people were arrested on Friday at a \u201ckill the bill\u201d demonstration and a Daily Mirror journalist shared video footage that appeared to show police pushing him and hitting him with a baton as he shouted that he was a member of the press.\\nLast week, the Guardian revealed the home secretary had backed police stepping in to enforce Covid laws, which bar gatherings. Priti Patel\u2019s supporters said she was right to criticise the Met after the event.\\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cAs the home secretary has made clear, the right to protest is a cornerstone of our democracy and the government is absolutely committed to maintaining freedom of expression.\\n\u201cIt is wrong to claim these measures will stop people from carrying out their civic right to protest. People will still be able to protest, but they cannot be permitted to trample on the rights of local businesses and communities.\\n\u201cThese measures will prevent misery to the public and the loss of millions of pounds to the taxpayers and businesses, have been requested by chief constables, including the Met, and are backed by the independent policing inspectorate.\u201d", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b15e24d633b9601162cc8c7ced8c9bf0a02a26a0/0_198_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Police at an Extinction Rebellion protest in Whitehall."]], "author": ["Vikram Dodd", "Jamie Grierson"], "date": "2021-03-28"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/31/hundreds-take-part-in-peaceful-kill-the-bill-protest-in-bristol": {"title": "Hundreds take part in peaceful \u2018kill the bill\u2019 protest in Bristol", "subtitle": null, "text": "Peaceful action contrasts with previous protests as police say they have pressed \u2018reset button\u2019\\nHundreds of people have taken part in a peaceful \u201ckill the bill\u201d protest in Bristol, with the police claiming they had pressed a \u201creset button\u201d after violent clashes during three previous demonstrations.\\nAbout 300 people met on College Green in Bristol, marched through the city centre and took part in a sit-down protest in front of Bridewell police station, which lasted into the early hours of Wednesday.\\nThe police station has been the focus of confrontations between police and protesters this month and the Avon and Somerset force has been accused of heavy-handed tactics.\\nOn Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning, more than 100 riot police were on standby in the city but remained largely out of sight, and the protest was allowed to go ahead.\\nThe protesters, mainly young people, took part in a low-key demonstration on College Green in front of the cathedral on Tuesday evening. Speeches were made criticising the government\u2019s police, crime, sentencing and courts bill and the local force\u2019s tactics in breaking up previous demonstrations.\\nThey then marched through the city centre playing music and chanting anti-bill and anti-police slogans before sitting down in front of the police station.\\nThe protesters inadvertently held up a convoy of film crew lorries in Bristol for a Stephen Merchant series called The Offenders, which follows seven strangers from different walks of life forced together to complete a community payback sentence in Bristol.

It\u2019s really peaceful and I think that\u2019s because there\u2019s not a small army of riot police anywhere near us.

It\u2019s a lot more constructive like this.\\n\u201cMy family are Travellers and this bill is going to affect them \u2013 if it goes through, they could lose their homes.

I want to make a better world for my children.\u201d\\nJames, 27, a musician, said: \u201cThe right to protest is just a fundamental pillar of democracy. We\u2019re branded as lefties for being here, but we have a right to protest. I\u2019m not here for any violence \u2013 I believe in nonviolent protest.\u201d\\nSupt Mark Edgington, of Avon and Somerset police, said on Wednesday: \u201cWe were committed to facilitating a peaceful protest in line with the Covid-19 legislation.\u201d\\nBefore the demonstration, Avon and Somerset police said changes to the coronavirus regulations meant it was possible for peaceful protests to go ahead.\\nEdgington said: \u201cNow that restrictions around protest have changed, we wanted to press a reset button, and I believe we achieved this last night. We have a long and proud history of facilitating peaceful protests spanning many years and today was a prime example of this.\\n\u201cWe continue to urge people to engage with us as early as possible and have a conversation around how we can assist in ensuring lawful protests.\u201d\\nMeanwhile , three leading trade unions have signed a statement of solidarity against the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill coordinated by Black Lives Matter UK and Sisters Uncut.\n The Universities and College Union, the Communication Workers Union and the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union are the first trade unions to sign up to the coalition of civil society groups opposing the bill. They joined a list of more than 100 organisations that have signed the latest statement against the bill, published on Wednesday morning.\n The statement says: \u201cThe police, crime, sentencing and courts bill is a dangerous and unnecessary piece of legislation that endangers the rights and safety of every single one of us.\n \u201cIt is therefore no surprise that those who are working to #KillTheBill have come together from every section of society.\u201d \u201d\\nThis weekend, further protests against the bill are expected to take place in London, Bristol and across the UK.\\nWednesday\u2019s statement is at least the third to be published opposing the bill that has attracted more than 100 signatories. A letter condemning the bill signed by 150 civil society organisations, including senior trade union officials, was sent to Priti Patel, the home secretary, on 15 March.

The pitchside adverts don\u2019t only celebrate Cooper\u2019s raunchy, horsey novels but also brands associated with healthy and sustainable living: Quorn, Oatly, Innocent, Elixinol cannabidiol products, Grundon environmentally friendly waste management. One has the skull and crossbones insignia of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society: Defending Ocean Wildlife Worldwide, it says. My stomach is getting to know a shiitake mushroom burger I ate just before kick-off, and finding it less confrontational, digestion-wise, than the traditional meat-and-whatever-else version that is served at football grounds.\\nFor this is Forest Green Rovers, declared by Fifa the \u201cgreenest team in the world\u201d, certified by the United Nations as the world\u2019s first carbon-neutral football club, which in the decade since its acquisition by the green energy industrialist Dale Vince has become famous well beyond its size, for its sustainability and, especially, for the all-vegan menus offered to both players and fans. It\u2019s not stopping there: apart from the coffee kits, there\u2019s also a plan for a new all-timber stadium designed by Zaha Hadid Architects, which in February was approved by the English Football League, having won planning permission from Stroud District Council last December.\\nNor are Vince\u2019s wider range of eco-initiatives slowing down. He shows me some diamonds on the Zoom screen, made with carbon (incredible as this may seem) taken from the atmosphere, a process that he says reduces the colossal waste that comes with mining the precious stones. He already has Devil\u2019s Kitchen, a vegan food business spun off from the football club, which makes burgers, plant balls and suchlike, now available through Ocado. The main source of his wealth is Ecotricity, a renewable energy supplier that developed from the windmills Vince erected in the 1990s. He created Nemesis, a Lotus Exige chassis modified with electric motors and batteries, which in 2012 broke the UK speed record for electric cars. Last month, he teamed up with the Daily Express, of all newspapers, to promote its Green Britain Needs You campaign.\\nVince\u2019s speciality is to bring green practices and ideas to blokey aspects of life not usually associated with such things: football, burgers, cars. Or, three decades ago, energy provision. \u201cYou have the most fun and most impact preaching to the unconverted,\u201d he says of his work with the Express. \u201cOn the right wing of life the people at the Express have had people saying to them: \u2018What are you doing working with that bloke?\u2019 and on the left wing of life I\u2019ve had people saying to me: \u2018What are you doing working with that newspaper?\u2019 And we both say the same thing \u2013 we can\u2019t live in our bubbles, we\u2019ve got to talk to each other.\u201d\\nVince, 59, is the sort of have-a-go entrepreneur who you might have thought was extinct in a time of corporate leviathans. He is restless, rapid-speaking, both engaging and elusive, his manner at once laidback and wired. I\u2019m told by people who\u2019ve dealt with him that he is both shy and direct, that \u201che doesn\u2019t hang back from expressing opinions\u201d, that he can be assertive, that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t suit the more English-y sort of people\u201d. As he describes himself in his recent book, Manifesto: \u201cI look at and do things my own way. It\u2019s got me into plenty of trouble but it\u2019s also a bit of a superpower.\u201d\\nHe might now be described as \u201cBritain\u2019s richest hippy\u201d, living in a castellated former fort on a hill above Stroud, with a large solar array in its untamed garden, but he once had almost nothing. The son of a Great Yarmouth lorry driver, he left school at 15 and spent years as a traveller, living in a lashed-up old ambulance, or a pickup truck, or a bus, driving a 30-year-old fire engine to Spain, riding motorbikes, moving from one site to another \u2013 \u201cold airfields, gravel pits, car parks\u201d, as Vince writes in Manifesto. In 1985 he was embroiled in the notorious \u201cBattle of the Beanfield\u201d, an outbreak of what he calls \u201cwanton state-sponsored violence\u201d, an assault by 1,300 police on 600 travellers heading towards Stonehenge.\\nIn 1991 he had \u201can epiphany\u201d. He\u2019d already made a little money putting up improvised wind-powered phone stations (\u201cwindphones\u201d) at the Glastonbury festival, and he\u2019d added a small windmill to his trailer, connected to old train batteries he\u2019d rescued from a scrapyard, capable of 50 watts, enough for two dim lights and water pump. The first big power-generating windmills in Britain were built that year, in Cornwall, and Vince decided to have a go himself. He educated himself on \u201caerodynamics, mechanics, electronics, statistics\u2026 windmill technology, planning and environment assessments, grid compatibility, financial modelling, construction\u201d.\\nHe made his own 30-metre mast for testing wind speed, won the co-operation of the owner of the hill, and spent his last \u201cfew hundred quid\u201d on some respectable clothes and a flight to Germany to meet the manufacturers of the then-unconventional variable-speed windmill that he wanted. He gained planning permission. Representing himself in court, he defeated a legal challenge from the National Trust. He negotiated a connection to the local grid, raised \u00a3350,000 in finance and, five years after his epiphany, got the windmill up and running.\\nThis was the beginning of Ecotricity, a company that in 2019 had a turnover of \u00a3201m. Later, Vince turned to electric transport: the Nemesis project never turned into a mass-produced car, but it did lead to the Electric Highway, a national network of charging points. Vince\u2019s company had to fight off an attempt by Elon Musk and Tesla to shove them aside, but it now has 300 stations across the country.\\nForest Green Rovers now looks like a perfect extension to the Ecotricity brand \u2013 it even has \u201cgreen\u201d in its name \u2013 but Vince insists that its transformation into a \u201cglobal force\u201d was \u201cserendipity\u201d. \u201cI just bumped into it along the way. It was a rescue mission, only that.\u201d The club was \u201cleaking money everywhere\u2026 it was about to fold. I thought that was wrong. It was a big part of this community, 120 years old, lovely people. They invited me to a game. It was fabulous, like a small theatre, intense and personal.\u201d\\nHe stepped in and bought it. \u201cOn day two I bumped into the fact that we were serving red meat to our players and I thought: \u2018Oh my God, we\u2019re part of the meat trade, I can\u2019t be that,\u2019 so we had to make that change.\u201d They realised, he says, \u201cthat we might not be speaking to the most receptive audience, but that only added to the appeal of doing it. The one thing everyone wants to know is how can you have a vegan menu without having a riot from your fans.\u201d The answer, he says, was to show that \u201cfood without animals in is great food\u201d. The club\u2019s players \u201cwere the easiest audience of all. We simply said to them that red meat will impair your performance.\u201d It\u2019s now widely recognised among elite athletes, says Vince, that vegan diets improve performance and reduce injury. The Manchester City striker Sergio Ag\u00fcero, for example, goes on a vegan diet during the football season.\\nSo they sell the fans pies, sausage rolls and burgers, chips and gravy, all plant-based, as well as options that are not imitating meat. Away supporters, the club chef Jade Crawford tells me, mockingly turn up in butchers\u2019 aprons. They chant \u201cWhere\u2019s your burger van?\u201d But, she says, the products she offers \u201csell out, so they must like them\u201d. Some home fans \u201csaid at first they were a bit annoyed about it. They said they might stop coming, but they tried the food and said it was really good.\u201d\\nThe diet has grabbed most of the headlines, but there are other aspects to Forest Green\u2019s greenness: power from solar panels and from Ecotricity\u2019s green energy, a pitch free of chemical fertilisers or pesticides, charging points for electric cars, the capturing of rainwater from the roof to irrigate the pitch, an electric van for the kit man, and soon, it is hoped, an electric team bus. There\u2019s a well-publicised \u201cmow-bot\u201d, a GPS-directed solar-powered lawnmower.\\nForest Green Rovers\u2019 performances on the pitch have improved since Vince\u2019s takeover. Once teetering on the edge of relegation from the Conference, the fifth tier of English football, they were later promoted to League Two, which in the logic-free system of numbering these things is the fourth tier. They currently have good prospects of promotion to League One and hopes of eventually getting to the level above that, the Championship.\\nThe combination of veganism, sustainability and some sporting success has brought them global attention. They have 100 fan clubs in over 20 countries, such as the Forest Green Rovers Chicagoland Supporters group, foundedin 2016 by people who \u201cshared a passion for the environment and soccer\u201d. The Arsenal full-back H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn, attracted by the club\u2019s ethos, has become a shareholder. \u201cEngaging fans through their favourite sport and getting them to be fans of the environment\u201d is what Vince calls it. The United Nations invited the club to be founding members of its Sports for Climate Action programme, which, he says, \u201cis pretty much based on what Forest Green have done\u201d. Bigger names have followed where Forest Green Rovers have led. The mighty Real Madrid recently announced a partnership with the British plant-based producer Meatless Farm to encourage sustainable eating (still a lesser level of commitment to the environment than that of the Stroud side).\\nThe future stadium, which will use contemporary timber engineering techniques to achieve its all-wooden structure, is intended as a vehicle to get the club to the next level, while also promoting its principles. It will have a capacity of 5,000, with the ability to go up to 10,000 or 12,000 without too much difficulty, which would be big enough for a Championship side. \u201cWe might shoot for 15,\u201d says the ever-ambitious Vince. Because timber is renewable, and absorbs carbon during its growth, it greatly reduces the carbon and energy costs that go into construction, which might be three times those expended on such things as light, heat and power used over the lifetime of a stadium.\\nThe stadium\u2019s completion is still some years off, not least because it is to be part of a grander plan: a \u201cGreen Technology Cluster\u201d, a \u201ctruly sustainable\u201d business park that aims to create up to 4,000 jobs. Some 20% of the 50 hectare site is to be wetlands, alongside a restored stretch of a historic canal. The location is currently green fields, next to Junction 13 of the M5. This doesn\u2019t sound environmental \u2013 neither building on fields nor relying on road transport \u2013 but \u201cfarmed fields are wildlife deserts\u201d, Vince says, and his proposals will provide more biodiversity than the land they replace. There are not many options for getting fans to his stadium by public transport, but he promises electric buses and cross-country walking and cycling routes.\\nThe seductive images of the project show an elegant curving form rising out of a lush green landscape, its undulations echoing the soft hills behind. In some ways it is what you would expect from Zaha Hadid Architects \u2013 striking forms are their thing, and their work on the London 2012 Aquatics Centre and Al Wakrah Stadium for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, as well as their now-abandoned designs for the Tokyo Olympic Stadium, have made sports buildings one of their specialities. On the other hand, the Forest Green Rovers project is small by the current standards of this global practice, and their designs \u2013 which are almost always in concrete and steel \u2013 have not hitherto been especially noted for their sustainability. The mighty roof of the Aquatics Centre, for example, used prodigious quantities of steel.\\nAlex de Rijke, an architect who has pioneered modern timber construction, including a proposed wooden handball arena for the London Olympics, is sceptical that ZHA are the best people for the job, given their previous lack of interest in timber structures. It\u2019s \u201cexcellent that Forest Green are building a timber stadium\u201d, he says, but wonders whether this design grows out of the structural characteristics of wood or steel. He suggests that the practice isn\u2019t usually driven by optimised use of sustainable materials, but by what he calls \u201cthe dogged mission to invent novel forms\u201d \u2013 the desire, to put it another way, to look striking.\\nJim Heverin, the director at ZHA in charge of the project, acknowledges that this is partly new territory for them, which was part of the attraction of the job: they want \u201cto grow out of the shadow of what people think we are, and carbon is the challenge of our generation\u201d. He says that the design does pay attention to issues such as waste \u2013 the curving silhouettes are made out of assemblies of straight elements, for example \u2013 and as it develops they will also consider such matters as the distance the materials have to travel from their place of origin.\\nHe\u2019s also clear that looking striking \u2013 the power of the image \u2013 is important to the practice, and that the project \u201cwill cost more than normal because it\u2019s not conventional \u2013 you can\u2019t just buy it out of factories\u201d. This reflects an aspect of the Vince philosophy, which is that \u201cwhether it\u2019s burgers, cars or football we can still have fun doing it differently\u201d. The idea of Nemesis, he once said, was to \u201csmash the boring, Noddy stereotype of the green car\u201d. His current plan for mining the sky for diamonds is \u201cbling without the sting\u201d.\\nWhich brings up a core question behind the whole Vince enterprise: what\u2019s the substance, what\u2019s the spectacle, what is what he calls \u201cstorytelling\u201d? It\u2019s hard to think, for example, that a solar-powered lawnmower will make a huge impact on the club\u2019s carbon footprint; its role is more to be an eye-catching messenger of its values. But it\u2019s hard to argue with the seriousness of his overall achievement. The point of his combined ventures is that they are all of the above: they combine the humdrum business of large-scale energy provision with the coffee kits and the shiitake burgers that get environmental messages to hard-to-reach audiences.\\nHis hometown of Stroud, birthplace of Extinction Rebellion, is the sort of place that would give short shrift to greenwash. Although his building proposals have attracted objections, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much by way of significant challenges to his overall green credentials. The worst thing I hear about him is that his presence is a bit too dominating, looking down on the town from his castle, his burger-windmill-diamond factory and frequent Ecotricity banners being hard to miss. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit medieval,\u201d I\u2019m told.\\nMolly Scott Cato, a Stroud resident who until Brexit was a Green party MEP for South West England, has had some political confrontations with the Labour-supporting Vince, who wanted the Greens to step aside at the last general election. But she said that \u201cit\u2019s brilliant for the town having a renewable energy firm\u201d and that the \u201cfootball club is really important in reaching out to people that are hardest to get to\u201d. He may not, with his flurries of initiatives, always get everything right, but collectively they\u2019re a force for good. If Forest Green Rovers raise the question: how much impact can a League Two football club have, the answer is quite a lot.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30e2927f046ab6c2a99a158dfac1d88bb66237a1/809_507_4586_2752/master/4586.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Forest Green Rovers cards"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16423e6a3ed19b14d8b7910f77d3e90e75318a5f/0_0_2364_1330/master/2364.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Zaha Hadid Architects\u2019 design for a new all-timber stadium."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93572e90bad67c3115e4182a299ba15836dac4e9/0_0_6717_4480/master/6717.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Dale Vince at the Forest Green Rovers ground in Nailsworth, Gloucestershire."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/880d3204421c99e99f689166dbaf5674a6406e93/0_0_2048_1365/master/2048.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Local author Jilly Cooper is a supporter of the club."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a9df924fe018ea5368a4e54de25d02cf3c5143c/0_0_4159_2869/master/4159.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Arsenal\u2019s H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn, attracted by the club\u2019s ethos, has become a shareholder."], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e9a5c2f0bc2875ffc15ddb006f11a0b32b82c3a/0_0_3210_1986/master/3210.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Forest Green Rovers v Colchester United - Sky Bet League Two"]], "author": ["Rowan Moore"], "date": "2021-03-28"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/mar/15/arrests-made-at-protest-against-policing-bill-and-violence-against-women": {"title": "Arrests made at London protest over policing powers and vigil", "subtitle": null, "text": "Protests around bill have become entwined with those in response to the death of Sarah Everard\\nPolice made arrests on Monday night after hundreds of people who had gathered to oppose the passage of a new policing bill and to highlight violence against women marched through central London.\\nThe police, crime, sentencing and courts bill, which had its second reading on Monday afternoon, has been criticised by civil society groups as \u201can attack on some of the most fundamental rights of citizens\u201d.

Protesters say that, after last week\u2019s violence, their side of the story has not been told\\nFor the third time in less than a week thousands of protesters gathered in the centre of Bristol last Friday to oppose the police and crime bill, which many fear will criminalise the social movements and vibrant, alternative cultures that have made the West Country city such a hub of resistance to the government.\\nAs the grey rain clouds over Bristol\u2019s crumbling, graffiti-scrawled Georgian streets and tower blocks gave away to cool spring sunshine, a diverse crowd of mainly young people assembled on muddy College Green, starting point for so many of the city\u2019s demonstrations over the years, including the Black Lives Matter march that toppled the statue of slave trader Edward Colston last June.\\n\u201cI\u2019ve got all my all rights from protests,\u201d said Ellen Healy over chants and the buzz of a police helicopter. \u201cAs a young lesbian, I owe everything I have to protesting.

Ten people were arrested and footage circulating online appeared to show a journalist and protesters being hit by truncheons and shields.\\nThe latest confrontations took place metres away from where violent clashes first broke out last Sunday, after the first \u201ckill the bill\u201d march, with more protests planned for coming days and weeks. Shocking footage of a burning police van led to almost universal condemnation from politicians including Priti Patel, Keir Starmer and the Labour mayor of the city, Marvin Rees.\\nYet a week later protesters believe their side of the story of that momentous night has still not been fully told. Avon and Somerset police announced that 40 of its officers had sustained injuries in the first protest on 21 March. Most seriously, it said that two had broken bones, and one of them also had a punctured lung \u2013 yet by the end of the week, the force had admitted that this was not true.\\nWhat is still not known is how many in the crowd were injured. A first aider on duty during the demo told the Observer that he personally treated six protesters, including people with bleeding head wounds, serious bruising and eye injuries. The first aider, who asked not be named, said he was also struck repeatedly with a baton. \u201cI told the policeman I was a first aider but he continued beating me,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to go to hospital and I now need weeks of physiotherapy.\u201d\\nWorse was to come in the view of the protesters. On Tuesday the city\u2019s large community of van dwellers and travellers set up a protest camp. The policing bill will introduce a new criminal offence of living in a vehicle without a landowner\u2019s consent and will give the police more powers to remove roadside encampments. Riot police cleared the camp in the evening and arrested 15 people for allegedly breaching Covid regulations.\\nAlthough no arrests were made for violent offences, many witnesses told the Observer they had seen people being struck by shields and pushed over while they were walking away from the camp.\\nThe city\u2019s former lord mayor, Cleo Lake, who is the Green party candidate for Avon and Somerset police commissioner, has called for an independent inquiry. \u201cThere\u2019s been a complete shift from the policing we had last year [during the BLM protest in the city] to the policing we have now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to look at it in the round. We\u2019ve heard about the police that were injured \u2013 and nobody wants anybody to be injured \u2013 but we haven\u2019t heard about how many protesters have been injured.\u201d\\nAn NHS worker on duty that night [Tuesday] told the Observer that no officers were treated in the hospital designated for the police, whereas the hospital designated for protesters was inundated with injured people. The worker, who also asked not to be named, said: \u201cOver the course of the night the hospitals that were taking protesters filled and the hospital taking police did not see a single officer.\u201d\\nAvon and Somerset Police said officers used force on Tuesday after protesters refused to disperse in spite of being told they were flouting Covid rules. The force added that officers were abused and attacked on the Sunday protest. Supt Mark Runacres said the crowd threw items including bottles and bricks at officers on Friday. \u201cOfficers repeatedly encouraged people to disperse but once the atmosphere changed and people became physical, it was necessary to take action,\u201d he said.\\nFor many in the city, the bill feels like a direct assault on their hard-won rights and alternative ways of life \u2013 at a time when lockdown makes it much harder for people to make their voices heard. An estimated 200 to 400 people live in vehicles in Bristol, making it one of the largest communities of \u201cvan dwellers\u201d in the country.\\nWhile some of these are artists and musicians who enjoy the freedom of life on the road, many are low-paid workers priced out of homes in the city. They include people who want to live in a low-impact, more sustainable way as well as homeless people escaping life on the streets.\\nYet there are growing fears that Bristol\u2019s van dwellers may be hounded from roads and laybys under the proposed powers in the bill.\\nRhiannon Craft, co-founder of Vehicles for Change, which represents van dwellers in the city, said they had no choice but to take to the streets over the bill.\\n\u201cMany of us feel we\u2019ve got to protest because otherwise our way of life is going to be completely outlawed. It\u2019s our last hope \u2013 our last resort. What else can we do?\u201d\\nThe number of young people living in vehicles is thought to be increasing as rents remain high. Michael Truesdale, who lives in a Transit van, said he was worried he may lose his home if the bill is passed. \u201cI live in a van and I\u2019m worried that soon I won\u2019t be able to \u2013 I\u2019ll be getting fined or imprisoned just for doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would never have got into this lifestyle if rents weren\u2019t so unaffordable for people like me.\u201d\\nThe bill contains measures that will have a direct impact on movements that have been nurtured in the city, such as Extinction Rebellion and Black Lives Matter. The bill will allow the police to impose far-reaching restrictions on protests, such as maximum noise levels and start and finish times. The home secretary will be able to define the point at which a protest becomes seriously disruptive, when the police can intervene.\\nWhile XR did not organise the recent protests, many of its supporters joined the marches. Colin Davis, a professor at Bristol University who has been part of Bristol XR since its beginnings, said there was a great deal of concern in the group. \u201cThe bill has been drafted to outlaw the kind of disruptive protest that is our modus operandi,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we need disruptive protest because we are sleepwalking into catastrophe.\u201d\\nThe bill also contains a new offence of damaging a statue, which could have landed the BLM protesters who pulled down the Colston statue with 10-year sentences. Lake said a generation of young people in the city had experienced the power of collective action during the BLM protests last summer and saw the bill as an attempt to prevent it ever happening again. \u201cLike it or not, they feel they made worldwide change last year,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir right to protest like that is under threat, so of course they are going to challenge it.\u201d\\nLake, who grew up in the city, added that Bristol valued the right to protest, which stretched back into its history. \u201cI\u2019m a woman of dual heritage. I\u2019m black. I\u2019m white.

This blog is now closed\\nBefore the prime minister steps up for his press conference, it is worth having a look at what Liberal MP Bridget Archer spoke about in her speech on the jobseeker changes last night.\\nThe government is moving the base rate by $50 a fortnight. For people who are now receiving the unemployment payment, that\u2019s a $100 cut from what they are receiving \u2013 the Covid supplement is worth about $150 a fortnight at the moment. That ends on 31 March and the new rate will mean people will have $44 a day to live on \u2013 instead of the pre-pandemic level of $40 a day. With that $4 comes a whole slew of increased mutual obligations, as well as a business narc line, if someone turns down a job.\\nArcher questioned her government\u2019s strategy on those mutual obligations:\\nWhilst the Coalition government is working to deliver some change, I still believe there is much more work to be done. You\u2019ve heard me say it in this House before, but it bears repeating again: we can\u2019t and we won\u2019t move the dial on long-term unemployment or intergenerational unemployment if we don\u2019t have wider reform \u2013 in particular, reform that addresses the barriers preventing a jobseeker recipient looking for or accepting meaningful work, such as access to childcare; reliable transport; mental and physical health challenges; trauma; and disadvantage.\\nThe consequent changes to mutual obligation are, in my view, very unhelpful.\\nThere is an opportunity to ensure that we look at how mutual obligation can be a more useful tool for those seeking work, rather than the increasingly meaningless burden it puts on both the potential employer and the potential employee. I fail to see how encouraging jobseekers to apply for jobs that they are in no way able to fill is helping anyone \u2026\\nWhile I certainly accept that there are a portion of jobseekers who don\u2019t want to engage, they make up an incredibly small minority of jobseekers. So where\u2019s the gap? When we talk about making someone job ready, what does this really mean? It needs to be about ensuring that someone is ready, beyond just having skills. What are the other barriers that may stop them from accepting work?\\nWe can\u2019t be expected to fix every challenge faced by an individual when they\u2019re looking for work. But when many of our population who need employment and want employment are bumping into one or more roadblocks, I do believe that as a government we have a responsibility to address some of the broader issues.\\nAnthony Albanese spoke about Nicolle Flint\u2019s speech in a doorstop interview this morning:\\nWell, no abuse should happen of any parliamentarian or any staff member. And I condemn any abuse Nicolle Flint was subject to, it\u2019s terrible treatment. I must say that the people who have been named \u2013 and some of them actually seem to be proud of their work \u2013 in Extinction Rebellion, they were occupying my office every week, harassing staff during not just the campaign but six months before the election. Every week at the same time they occupied the office a number of times, including on one occasion, they got left in the office because they clearly want the police to be called and they were in a secure area of the office so it was just left unlocked and then a staff member had to go back later on.\\nWe need to in this country be able to have disagreements about political views and put them forward in a civil way and that should be the case.\\nHe\u2019s then asked about her point that Labor leaders didn\u2019t call it out at the time:\\nI think it\u2019s is a political comment from Nicolle Flint. The fact is that in terms of inappropriate behaviour, I call it out whenever I\u2019m asked to do so, whenever I\u2019m aware of it. I do it consistently each and every time, regardless of who it\u2019s directed at. Nicolle Flint was subjected to very bad behaviour and that shouldn\u2019t have happened.\\nScott Morrison will hold a press conference at 9.20am to detail the PNG health response.\\nFirst Nations women are 35 times \u2013 35 times \u2013 more likely to experience violence than non-Indigenous women.\\nMalarndirri McCarthy spoke about it on the ABC this morning and said it was not a new problem:\\nWell, it always has been [an issue]. It\u2019s not something that just occurred this week. The concerns of First Nations women we\u2019ve been raising for decades, really. You only have to go even as far back as the Bringing Them Home report with the stolen generations when you could see what occurred during that period. So it\u2019s not new to First Nations women, sadly \u2026\\nWhat has been done over the many, many years is that you\u2019ve had First Nations women\u2019s organisations across Australia and you\u2019ve had women\u2019s shelters across Australia working with First Nations women and funding for those organisations has decreased quite rapidly. And even the women\u2019s legal services and, you know, Aboriginal legal services have had their funding cut so considerably. And I think we have to point out consistently to not only the federal government, but to governments across the country that if you\u2019re going to do that, you are going to see the less help for those women who need it, in particular in those areas of domestic and family violence.\\nThe interview moved on to the allegations female Labor staffers have levelled against the party.\\nFran Kelly: [Nicolle Flint] told you in that speech last night in the parliament to get your own house in order. And there have been dozens of anonymous complaints made by current and former Labor staffers of unwanted touching, bullying, forced kissing, an older Labor man getting a young woman drunk before having non-consensual sex. These are the anonymous complaints on this website, on this Facebook page. Tanya Plibersek says Labor men need to be held to account. What are you doing as Labor leader to put a stop to this kind of behaviour, to make the Labor party a safe workplace for women? Anthony Albanese:\\nWell, what I\u2019ve done is update, through the ALP national executive, a comprehensive plan to stamp out sexual harassment and bullying. We have four policies that have been adopted. A comprehensive anti-sexual harassment policy, an anti-bullying policy, a complaints process that provides for independent processes and the code of conduct. And it applies not just for members of parliament, it applies to any activity where the ALP is involved. For example, any campaign, any function across the board. We need to do better and will continue to work. That was a policy that was developed under the chairmanship of Sharon Claydon, the chair of the caucus, and was adopted unanimously by the ALP national executive.\\nKelly: Since it was released a couple of weeks ago, there are some reports that some Labor women don\u2019t believe it gives them still enough confidence and comfort to come forward. I think women listening now would want to know what you will do if an allegation of bullying or sexual harassment was made that isn\u2019t anonymous, if the perpetrator is named. What action will you take against that man? Albanese:\\nWell, we\u2019ll act, Fran.\\nKelly: What does act mean? What would you do? Would you suspend them?Albanese:\\nFor example, one of the issues that\u2019s been raised publicly was a complaint against a staff member. And that was made by someone who wasn\u2019t a federal staff member. That person is no longer employed. It was dealt with in conjunction with the woman who made the complaint. And action was taken to the satisfaction of the woman involved.\\nBut it did happen. So did politics triumph safety when it came to the Boothby election contest?\\nAnthony Albanese:\\nWell, it shouldn\u2019t have happened. Full stop. It shouldn\u2019t have happened to anyone in any campaign. Full stop. I condemn. I can\u2019t do more than that. I wasn\u2019t visiting Boothby in those last couple of weeks. Anytime that I got asked about behaviour, I would have said exactly the same thing.\\nI said the same thing when my office had broken windows every week.\\nEventually the person was arrested who engaged in that behaviour. And during this period of time, I\u2019ve got to say, the people who answer phones have been subject to a really difficult period over the last few weeks.\\nWe have had to get mental health support for a range of staff members.\\nI\u2019m sure that applies absolutely across the board. So I stand with Nicolle Flint.\\nHer story is one that is appalling that that sort of behaviour was directed at her.\\nAnthony Albanese was asked about Nicolle Flint\u2019s speech in parliament last night (you\u2019ll find it below) while speaking to the ABC\u2019s Fran Kelly this morning:\\nNicolle Flint deserved to be safe as a member of parliament. And we must listen to her story and all the stories about women\u2019s involvement and, indeed, people\u2019s involvement in politics. We must learn to have disagreements in a civil way. The people who have been named in articles as being involved in this are organisations like Extinction Rebellion and some people at GetUp. At the same time, they were, of course, protesting against Labor MPs in some seats, including mine that was being occupied every week at the same time. And certainly, the women staff who worked for me, and my electorate office is all female staff, felt intimidated by occupations of the office. It shouldn\u2019t happen. It shouldn\u2019t happen to anyone.\\nAlso yesterday, Malarndirri McCarthy gave this speech:\\nThree years ago, women from the Tangentyere Women's Family Safety Group in Alice Springs travelled to Canberra to urge the Govt to listen to their voices on family & domestic violence issues.

Following a landmark legal case in the US made famous by the Mark Ruffalo film Dark Waters, a huge epidemiological study was carried out that linked PFAS to high cholesterol, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, testicular cancer, kidney cancer and pregnancy-induced hypertension.\\nSeparate studies have made connections between PFAS and miscarriage, reduced birth weight, endocrine disruption, reduced sperm quality, delayed puberty, early menopause and reduced immune response to tetanus vaccination. Scientists have also found that the substances can be passed from mother to baby via the placenta and breast milk.\\nOn top of multiple class actions in the US, cases are being brought around the world. In Australia, two towns adjacent to airbases using PFAS in firefighting foam have been warned not to drink their tap water, and in Italy industry is thought to have exposed 350,000 people to the toxic contaminant. It is estimated that almost everyone in the world now has PFAS in their blood.\\nIn England, the Environment Agency says PFAS is \u201cubiquitous in the environment\u201d, particularly in its waters, making it unlikely that drinking water sources have escaped contamination. But unlike countries such as the US, where a nationwide testing scheme is under way, the UK government has so far only made plans to make plans to understand the levels of drinking water pollution.\\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) says it takes \u201cthe risks posed by PFAS chemicals very seriously, which is why we\u2019re working at pace with regulators to better assess their presence in our natural environment and their sources.\u201d It says it is \u201cdeveloping its approach to managing risk from PFAS\u201d but it is not testing drinking water.\\nWater companies do not routinely test for PFAS either. Instead, they are expected to \u201cconsider\u201d just two restricted PFAS \u2013 PFOS and PFOA \u2013 in their risk assessments. According to Defra, there \u201chave been no notifications of an event associated with elevated levels of PFOS or PFOA since 2005\u201d. In Scotland, only PFOA is risk-assessed.\\nDr Ian Ross, the global PFAS practice lead at the consultancy Tetra Tech, says the huge number of potential PFAS sources \u2013 from airfields and industry to landfills and car washes \u2013 make risk assessment very difficult.\\n\u201cWater companies may need to perform a detailed assessment of many catchments considering a multitude of PFAS sources before determining that water from each catchment is unlikely to supply PFAS-impacted water,\u201d Ross said. \u201cThis is more concerning now a new, lower, 10 nanogram/litre limit from the drinking water inspectorate has been introduced, which triggers consultation with health professionals.\u201d\\nThe industry group WaterUK said: \u201cCompanies in risk areas have monitoring in place to support the removal of PFAS, and other potentially harmful substances, to ensure drinking water is clean and safe.\u201d\\nEven so, the drinking water inspectorate has only set the 10ng/l limit for PFOS and PFOA, and there are no limits on the wider group of chemicals. In contrast, Denmark has a limit of 100ng/l for the total of 12 PFAS, with lower levels proposed for PFOS of 3ng/l; Sweden has set a 90ng/l for the sum of 11 PFAS; and Bavaria has regulated 13 individual PFAS to a range of limits between 0.1 micrograms (\u00b5g)/l and 10\u00b5g/l.\\nThe EU recently revised its drinking water directive, reducing the acceptable level to 100ng/l for 20 types of PFAS and 500 ng/l for all PFAS substances. The directive entered into force in January and member states have two years to adopt it.\\nIt is not clear whether the UK will follow suit. Defra has said it will \u201cconsider the effect of the changes made to the directive\u201d but made no commitment to adopt it.\\nDr Paul Johnston, from Greenpeace\u2019s research laboratory at the University of Exeter, said: \u201cWe\u2019re literally flying blind on this as a nation,\u201d adding that the government had \u201chad plenty of heads up on this from what has been going on in the US\u201d.\\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s quite baffling why it hasn\u2019t actually been done in a systematic way, if only to validate the risk assessments \u2026 you need to be able to back it up with real-world analysis.\u201d\\nDr Julie Schneider, of the chemicals charity Chem Trust, said: \u201cPeople have the right to know if the water from their tap is contaminated with these harmful chemicals. We urgently need a full assessment of PFAS contamination in drinking water in the UK. Continuous exposure to PFAS may lead to long-term adverse health effects, and drinking water is recognised as one of the main sources of our exposure to PFAS.\u201d\\nAn outright ban on all non-essential uses of PFAS is under discussion among EU countries, but there are no signs that the UK intends to take the same tack. \u201cEvery year of delay in regulating these chemicals means an increasing level of exposure due to their extreme persistence and capacity to accumulate in the water and the wider environment,\u201d said Schneider.\\nResponding to the use restrictions put in place on PFOS and PFOA, the industry has created replacement chemicals known as GenX, but researchers suggest these could be just as harmful to humans and the environment, and could be even harder to detect.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e59fb999a632fa9e9ed3b9a04b52215afb233872/0_38_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Tap water"]], "author": ["Rachel Salvidge"], "date": "2021-03-25"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/24/syngenta-paraquat-deadly-john-heylings": {"title": "'A sip can kill': did a chemical company misrepresent data to avoid making a safer product?", "subtitle": null, "text": "A former Syngenta scientist alleges lives could have been saved with tweaks to the formulation of weedkiller paraquat\\nAround the world, the deadly dangers of a weedkiller called paraquat are well known. When working with the highly toxic herbicide, farmers and other users take care not to splash or spill even small amounts of the product, heeding regulatory warnings that just a tiny amount \u2013 if swallowed \u2013 will kill them.\\n\u201cIf you ingest just three drops of paraquat you\u2019re going to die,\u201d said the US farmer Cameron Peirce who uses the chemical sparingly in his fields of canola and mung beans in Kansas.\\nSwitzerland, the home base of the paraquat maker Syngenta, has banned the chemical since 1989, and it has been banned for use in the EU since 2007, because of paraquat\u2019s deadliness.\\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) allows only restricted use of the pesticide in the United States by people certified and trained to apply it, such as landscapers and farmers. And the agency warns users on a government website that \u201cone sip can kill\u201d. Paraquat warning labels carry the symbol of death \u2013 a skull and crossbones.\\nParaquat exposure is also believed by some scientists to cause Parkinson\u2019s disease, and Syngenta is facing litigation on that issue \u2013 though it denies responsibility.\\nStill, many countries allow wide use of paraquat, and the toll from paraquat poisonings is estimated at well into the thousands. The low cost and high toxicity makes paraquat a popular poison for people trying to kill themselves. Syngenta says it is just one of 377 companies worldwide that have registered paraquat for sale.\\nBut now, internal corporate documents, obtained by a US law firm and provided to the Guardian, detail how the need for a safer formulation of Syngenta\u2019s popular Gramoxone paraquat-based product has been the subject of in-depth company discussions for decades. Years of analysis and debate over the issue are laid out in the records, as are arguments about the accuracy of data presented to regulators, and strategies to avoid regulatory bans.\\nThe documents, which date back to 1968, show that Syngenta and its predecessor corporate entities rejected or resisted many different options for changes to the formulations of Gramoxone, due, at least in part, to a desire to protect profits. Financial concerns were cited repeatedly in the discussions about formulation changes as company officials pushed to keep Gramoxone on the market despite mounting concerns about fatalities.\\nThe documents also show that a longtime Syngenta scientist, who left the company in April 2008 after 28 years, argued with company officials multiple times over his belief that lives could have been saved with tweaks to product formulations that he said Syngenta considered too costly to make.\\nThat scientist, Jon Heylings, formerly the head of research and investigative toxicology at Syngenta, accuses his former employer and Syngenta\u2019s predecessor companies of relying on data generated in the 1970s that, according to Heylings, misrepresented the amount of an additive that could potentially make Gramoxone less deadly.\\nHeylings told the company more of the additive was needed than was stated. But his concerns were rejected and a product he developed that he believed was safer was shelved. After first raising the issue within the company in 1990, Heylings \u2013 who now works as a contractor for Public Health England on paraquat matters \u2013 recently renewed his push for Syngenta to acknowledge his concerns.\\n\u201cI am sure we all agree that falsified data should not be used on matters of human safety with Syngenta\u2019s products,\u201d Heylings wrote in a June 2019 email to Syngenta\u2019s global regulatory manager.\\nThe documents show Syngenta\u2019s product safety team determined internally that Heylings\u2019 allegations were not substantiated and sent him a lengthy rebuttal to his assertions.\\n\u201cWhile we respect your opinion, we believe we have thoroughly investigated and addressed your concerns,\u201d the global regulatory manager responded to Heylings.\\nSyngenta told the Guardian that Heylings\u2019 allegations were meritless, and said the company was \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to ensuring its products are used safely. \u201cHeylings is now turning to the media because his views have not been accepted by Syngenta or the regulatory bodies he approached and are not supported by modern medical science as well,\u201d the firm said.\\nHeylings is now working with the environmental organization Greenpeace to publicize his accusations and alert regulators. He sent his allegations to the EPA and to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO).\\nAt the heart of the matter is a chemical compound that induces vomiting when ingested. After introducing Gramoxone in 1962, a Syngenta predecessor called Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) began exploring the idea of adding an emetic, as the compound is called, to its paraquat product to trigger rapid vomiting in people who ingested it. If the vomiting happened fast enough, the theory went, it possibly could rid people\u2019s bodies of the poison before it could kill them.\\nThe idea was not initially embraced, as seen in comments from 1970 correspondence that \u201ca very large quantity of emetic\u201d would be needed in the formulation, which would make it \u201cundesirable from commercial and other points of view \u2026\u201d and even if added it was unlikely to \u201csucceed in preventing fatalities\u201d.\\nFaced with evidence of accidental poisonings and also intentional ingestion by people trying to kill themselves, the company continued to explore the idea, however, investigating what quantities of emetic would be required to induce vomiting fast enough to prevent death.\\nIn a 1972 company document marked \u201chighly confidential\u201d, objectives were laid out for a paraquat \u201creduction of hazards\u201d project. The document states the team agreed to \u201cinvestigate all possible means of reducing accident hazards by formulation\u201d, but also stated: \u201cThe team recognized that there were alternative approaches to the problem of saving lives and maintaining \u2018Gramoxone\u2019 on the market and that the introduction of safer formulations might not be the means adopted.\u201d\\nBy 1973, the issue was becoming urgent, according to the minutes of a meeting discussing what progress had been made on development of a safer formulation. The head of the UK Poisons Centre told company officials that it was becoming increasingly difficult for him to \u201cchampion\u201d Gramoxone as he had done for years due to the evidence of related poisonings and deaths, and called for \u201csomething to be done in a hurry\u201d.\\nStill, the company resisted adding an emetic, with one official stating that the drawback to adding an emetic to Gramoxone was \u201cmainly one of cost and compatibility,\u201d according to a 1974 company document.\\nThe records show that in addition to the idea of adding an emetic, the company explored many additions to its formulations to deter people, particularly children, from ingesting paraquat, including the addition of a coloring agent to differentiate the pesticide from the appearance of tea or a soft drink, a stench to make the product smell bad, solid formulations and stronger warning language on labels.\\nThe company\u2019s pursuit of a safer formulation became even more urgent in the mid-1970s as regulators increasingly took note of the deadly nature of the chemical and a US distribution partner feared the United States would force the product from the market there.\\nAfter studying the emetic on monkeys, dogs and other animals, as well as a small human trial, the company eventually settled on a dose of 5mg per 10ml of Gramoxone, and research supporting that dose was submitted to regulators.\\nThe emetic was added to paraquat formulations in various countries starting in 1977, including in Western Samoa (now Samoa), where company officials reported a \u201cregrettably high incidence of suicides with paraquat\u201d.\\nBut after more than a decade of the addition of the emetic and other changes aimed at deterring ingestion, the company was still facing problems with high numbers of paraquat poisonings, according to an October 1990 internal memo. Measures that might lower deaths, such as diluting liquid formulations at least five times, would \u201cdestroy Group profit from paraquat\u201d, the memo states.\\nIt was in 1990 that Heylings began championing a higher level of emetic. He told company officials the data underlying the dose decision from the 1970s was deeply flawed and that the research actually reflected that it would take three times the amount of emetic to render the weedkilling products less deadly.\\nYet, according to company correspondence in 1997, newer research showed that too high of a level of emetic could cause vomiting that was so violent that it could damage the gastrointestinal tract and push vomit into the lungs.\\nSyngenta said that the EPA and FAO have disagreed with Heylings\u2019 conclusions and that adding more emetic could actually create more harm.\\n\u201cWe reject any suggestion that in developing this product Syngenta and its predecessors had any motive other than to find the most appropriate level of emetic in paraquat to best address the risk from accidental and deliberate ingestion,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cSyngenta has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in developing and commercializing safer paraquat formulations over many decades.\u201d\\nAnd despite the risk to users, Syngenta\u2019s paraquat product is an \u201cessential weed-control and resistance-management tool for farmers\u201d, the company said, adding it uses a blue dye and a stenching agent to make it safer.\\nThe FAO said it looked into Heylings\u2019 allegations and is finalizing a report on paraquat now, with its conclusions to be published soon. The EPA also confirmed its awareness of Heylings\u2019 allegations, but said the agency does not require any amount of emetic in paraquat products and believes the measures that truly save lives are the warning labels and restrictions on use.\\nConcerns about accidental poisonings are only the tip of an iceberg of issues that have emerged about the dangers of paraquat and Syngenta\u2019s efforts to deal with those dangers.\\nThe lawyer who obtained the internal documents, Missouri-based litigator Steve Tillery, has been quietly amassing evidence that he says shows Syngenta not only skimped on the emetic in its formulations, but knew \u2013 and covered up \u2013 evidence that the product also causes Parkinson\u2019s disease in long-term users such as farmers.\\nSyngenta denies any such evidence of a connection between their product and Parkinson\u2019s, which is an incurable progressive nervous system disorder that limits a person\u2019s ability to control movement, causing tremors, loss of balance and eventually often leaving victims bedridden or forced to use a wheelchair. It also denies any attempt at a cover-up.\\nSeveral scientific studies have linked paraquat to Parkinson\u2019s, including a large study of US farmers jointly overseen by multiple government agencies. But the EPA recently completed what it called a \u201cthorough review\u201d of the scientific information on paraquat and Parkinson\u2019s disease and concluded that the weight of evidence was \u201cinsufficient\u201d to link paraquat to Parkinson\u2019s disease.\\nThe company\u2019s handling of the emetic situation is illustrative of its handling of concerns about Parkinson\u2019s disease, according to Tillery, who said he hopes to be able to introduce evidence of the emetic issue in the Parkinson\u2019s litigation.\\nThe first case to go to trial over the allegations against Syngenta over paraquat and Parkinson\u2019s is scheduled for 12 April in Illinois. The trial is very likely to be delayed due to precautions related to the Covid-19 virus, however, according to a court spokesperson.\\nThat Illinois case \u2013 Hoffman V Syngenta \u2013 is one of several pending against Syngenta alleging the company\u2019s paraquat products cause Parkinson\u2019s disease. Syngenta was acquired by China National Chemical Corporation (ChemChina) in 2015, giving an added international twist to the litigation.\\nLawyers around the US are now seeking people who may have been exposed to paraquat and now suffer from Parkinson\u2019s disease.\\nHeylings has been deposed by the US law firm, and said he would like to help in the US court case against Syngenta.\\n\u201cThis is important. This is human health,\u201d he said in an interview arranged by Greenpeace. \u201cMaybe the legal system in the US will get to the bottom of this.\u201d\\nIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

As legal challenges escalate, will Britain\u2019s great traffic experiment be shut down before we have time to see the benefits?\\nOn an overcast Saturday afternoon in December, a convoy of 30 cars, led by a red Chevrolet pickup truck, set off from the car park of an east-London Asda with hazard lights flashing. The motorists, who formed a \u201cfestive motorcade\u201d, wore Santa hats as they made their way slowly through the borough of Hackney before coming to a halt outside the town hall a couple of hours later.\\nThey had gathered to register their outrage at being the victims, as they saw it, of a grand experiment that has been taking place on England\u2019s roads since the start of the pandemic. As the national lockdown eased last summer, swathes of Hackney, stretching from Hoxton\u2019s dense council estates at the borough\u2019s western border with Islington to the edge of the River Lea marshland near Stratford in the east, had been closed to through traffic.\\nLocals found their usual routes were shut off with little warning. Danielle Ventura Presas, one of the protesters, told me that she now struggled to get her disabled cousin to day care while also dropping off her two children at school on time. As we rolled through Clapton, another campaigner got out of her car and slowed the convoy to a walking pace, leading chants of \u201creopen our side roads!\u201d on a megaphone.\\nThe road closures formed part of a wider scheme to tackle London\u2019s growing congestion problems. Between 2009 and 2019, miles driven on its residential streets increased by 70%, in part due to the rise of Uber, online delivery services and GPS technology. Air pollution, meanwhile, plays a role in the premature deaths of nearly 10,000 Londoners each year. When the pandemic arrived, this trend was briefly interrupted: the roads fell quiet, and the novelty of car-free streets encouraged more people to go out on their bikes. In May 2020, the government tried to capitalise on the bike boom by announcing the biggest ever investment in \u201cactive travel\u201d \u2013 walking, cycling or scooting. The short-term aim of the fund was to make it easier for people to get around without using public transport. The broader vision \u2013 reducing reliance on the private car \u2013 was more radical.\\nIn London, the Streetspace plan unveiled by mayor Sadiq Khan and Transport for London (TfL), demanded \u201can urgent and swift response\u201d to the crisis. The strategy funnelled money from the government\u2019s new active-travel fund to London\u2019s boroughs for low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) and other projects to encourage walking and cycling, such as temporary cycle lanes and timed road closures outside schools. By the end of last year, there were about 100 in London, where they have been most widely adopted, but they are now being rolled out in Manchester, Birmingham and other cities.\\nLTNs block motor traffic from sidestreets with physical barriers such as planters or bollards, or with number plate recognition cameras at their boundaries which local authorities use to issue fines to drivers entering the zone. Residents inside LTNs can still drive to their home, but they may have to take a longer way round. The theory is that by reducing the amount of road space for cars, people will find other ways to make short journeys. (In London, almost half of car journeys are less than 2 miles.) That means more walking and cycling, which ultimately means less pollution, less congestion, quieter, safer streets and healthier citizens.\\nCritics of LTNs say closing sidestreets increases congestion elsewhere, but early monitoring of new LTNs in Hackney and Lambeth found that traffic on main roads hardly increased at all. Data from established LTNs in Walthamstow showed the opposite, although transport academic Rachel Aldred suggests that it is hard to draw conclusions about the specific impacts of these schemes as traffic in the area was rising more generally at the time.\\nEnthusiasm for LTNs brought about a rare consensus between the Conservative government and the Labour mayor of London, as well as Greens and pro-cycling groups. But an opposition also sprang up, bringing together an equally unlikely alliance of anti-gentrification activists, professional drivers, Labour and Conservative backbenchers, local councils, motoring lobbyists and a raft of new grassroots campaigners who shared their outrage on neighbourhood Facebook groups. On social media, each side conjured up its own vision of life in low-traffic neighbourhoods: one a utopia of families cycling happily together on quiet streets, with children wobbling out in front; the other a nightmare of permanently congested roads, with emergency vehicles snared in the gridlock.\\nThe protesters in the Hackney motorcade stressed that they had only brought their cars in order to respect social distancing and allow disabled people to participate. But the exuberant procession of cars, with their horns honking and engines revving, seemed to suggest something bolder: motorists reasserting their right to take up space on urban streets.\\nSeveral cars in the motorcade had cabbage leaves lodged under windscreen wipers or taped to their doors, a reference to one of the most bitter exchanges in the conflict. Over the summer, Hackney\u2019s cabinet member for transport, the Liverpudlian Jon Burke, had become a hate figure for opponents of LTNs after he responded to tweets which called for him to \u201cgo home\u201d by tweeting: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for immigrants, \u2018born n bred\u2019 Londoners would still be eating cabbage with every meal.\u201d\\nFor anti-LTN campaigners, who sometimes caricature cycling advocates as a privileged elite, this was incendiary provocation. \u201cWhat he\u2019s having a go at is the white working class,\u201d said Niall Crowley, one of the organisers of the protest. \u201cThat\u2019s really incensed people.\u201d In September, Burke received a handwritten death threat, and at the start of this year, he announced he would resign as a Hackney councillor in order to stand in his home city\u2019s mayoral race. A newsletter issued by the Hackney protesters proclaimed his departure their victory.\\nAfter the UK\u2019s first lockdown ended in July, the traffic soon returned and talk of the government\u2019s promised \u201ccycling revolution\u201d faded, while some objectors continued to vandalise its remnants. In Hackney, the new street signs were spray painted, and someone cut the cables on an expensive new traffic enforcement camera. In Ealing, bollards were removed one night and the holes they left behind filled in with concrete. Meanwhile, opponents of the mayor\u2019s walking and cycling plans have pursued numerous legal challenges to the new policies.\\nBurke told me LTNs were just one part of a complete reimagining of the borough\u2019s public spaces for a low-carbon future. \u201cWe\u2019re introducing huge amounts of cycle storage, the largest electric vehicle charging programme in the country, and we\u2019re massively improving the quality of our public realm with the largest tree planting programme in Europe. I get emails from people saying \u2018you\u2019re the most hated man in Hackney\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I want to have a dialogue with those people, but I\u2019m not going to tell them there\u2019s a solution to the problems we face that allows them to continue driving to the same extent they were previously.\u201d\\nThe next few months will be decisive, as councils push for temporary schemes to become permanent, and objectors fight for the right to drive wherever they need to go. London\u2019s great traffic experiment hangs in the balance.\\nFor many Conservative voters and MPs, the party\u2019s apparent shift from championing the car to promoting bikes is cause for alarm. In May 2020, Boris Johnson, himself a committed cyclist, announced a new \u201cgolden age\u201d for cycling, as part of the Conservatives\u2019 broader \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d strategy. This stated aim to reduce transport emissions \u2013 which was somewhat undermined earlier this month when Johnson announced his intention to cut taxes on domestic flights \u2013 has created an internal schism in a party that has traditionally represented the motorist\u2019s interests. \u201cMotorists did not vote for the Green party in the general election. But that is what we\u2019ve got,\u201d Howard Cox, the founder of the pro-driving campaign FairFuelUK, told me by email.\\nAs polling shows, people tend to like green policies in theory but less so when they are the ones being inconvenienced by them. Last year, a YouGov study found that the average British person was \u201can environmentally concerned recycler, who takes their own bag to the supermarket but also likes their meat, and balks at the thought of paying more tax to fund policies for tackling climate change\u201d.\\nAfter Conservative-controlled Kensington and Chelsea council removed a major cycle lane just seven weeks into its trial period, the Daily Mail reported that the prime minister\u2019s transport adviser, Andrew Gilligan, called the council to let it know Johnson had gone \u201cballistic\u201d at its decision. Gilligan, who worked with Johnson at the Spectator and later served as cycling commissioner during Johnson\u2019s second term as mayor of London, has been instrumental in pushing the Tories to invest record sums in walking and cycling, according to several interviewees working in the transport sector.\\nDuring his stint at City Hall, Gilligan gained a reputation for his \u201chard-nosed\u201d operating style. \u201cWhen we agreed, it was great, it was going to move forward very fast, there would be no obstacles in his path,\u201d said Simon Munk, an infrastructure campaigner at the London Cycling Campaign. \u201cBut when you disagree with him and you become one of those obstacles, it\u2019s quite a full-on experience.\u201d Gilligan has shown the same single-mindedness at No 10. In May, when the Department for Transport invited all councils to bid for a fund to create temporary walking and cycling schemes, one of the conditions of the first wave of funding was that schemes had to be in place within 12 weeks.\\n\u201cThe problem we\u2019ve ended up with is because boroughs have been encouraged by the government to introduce them at such speed,\u201d said Caroline Pidgeon, a Liberal Democrat member of the London assembly and a longstanding member of its transport committee. \u201cPeople feel it\u2019s being done to them rather than feeling like they\u2019ve been brought along.\u201d\\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cWe want to ensure people have more opportunities to choose cycling and walking for their day-to-day journeys, as part of our wider plans to boost active travel \u2013 benefitting both the nation\u2019s health and the environment. That\u2019s why we have committed a significant \u00a3175m to create safe spaces for cycling and walking as surveys and independent polls show strong public support for high-quality schemes.\u201d\\nAmong the many dissenters to the introduction of LTNs across the country are 14 Tory MPs, who signed a letter in November to the transport secretary Grant Shapps, calling on the government to \u201cstop the uncalled-for war on the motorist\u201d and withdraw \u201cthe blockades and dedicated cycle lanes eating into our town and city roads\u201d. The spectre of the \u201cwar on the motorist\u201d, in which the longsuffering driver is constantly thwarted in his efforts to get around, while being made to pay more and more for the privilege of doing so, has been with us since at least the 60s, despite having little basis in fact.\\nIn 2011, the coalition government declared an end to the conflict, promising to quell \u201cWhitehall\u2019s addiction to micromanagement\u201d. Unsurprisingly, that wasn\u2019t the end of the story. Earlier this year, a Telegraph editorial called on Conservatives to once again take a stand against Sadiq\u2019s Khan\u2019s war on cars.\\nThe MPs\u2019 letter was organised by the campaign group FairFuelUK, which works with mostly Conservative politicians in an all-party parliamentary group, arranging meetings with motoring campaigners and planning political actions. \u201cBackbench Tories have told me they\u2019re uncomfortable with the government\u2019s focus on the privileged cycling few,\u201d said Cox. \u201cThe prime minister and his Lycra-clad advisers are out of touch with economic reality and majority opinion.\u201d\\nNiall Crowley, the Hackney roads protester who will stand as a candidate in council byelections in Hoxton East and Shoreditch, agrees. Frustrations about low-traffic neighbourhoods, he told me, are really about the fact that people resent top-down decision-making and feel excluded from local democratic processes. \u201cEverything I read, it\u2019s \u2018we\u2019re doing this and you have to get used to it\u2019. If you\u2019re going to treat residents as a problem to be managed or nudged, then what kind of democracy is that?\u201d\\nIn September, a group of black cab drivers and their supporters gathered outside City Hall in London to accuse mayor Sadiq Khan of \u201cdestroying London\u201d. A campaigner gave a speech on the concourse outside the mayor\u2019s office, grimly predicting that the black cab\u2019s days were numbered if road closures were not reversed. \u201cThis is the endgame,\u201d he told the crowd.\\nDuring the summer, TfL had barred taxis and other private vehicles from Bishopsgate, an ancient road that takes its name from the defensive wall built by the Romans around the city. The road runs past Liverpool Street station and into the financial district; cars, cabs, buses and cyclists compete for space. Cab drivers were also angry about TfL\u2019s decision to exclude them from some central London bus lanes, which they can ordinarily use to drive around the city more quickly. They also protested about about losing access to other main roads under restrictions that allow only buses, cyclists and emergency vehicles to pass through.\\nAlthough taxi drivers have been the vanguard of the resistance to Khan\u2019s active travel plans, Steve McNamara, the chair of the Licensed Taxi Drivers\u2019 Association, said cabbies were not always opposed to new cycle lanes. \u201cIt\u2019s much less stressful for them if they\u2019re driving their cab and the cyclist is in a nice segregated lane next to them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what we don\u2019t support are these ones that are banged in with very little planning, that look like they\u2019ve been designed on the back of a fag packet.\u201d\\nIn interviews, McNamara repeatedly returns to a theme that cyclists are a privileged minority making life more difficult for working-class drivers in the suburbs. \u201cIf you can afford to live centrally, and you\u2019ve got a well-paid job in the city or central London, it\u2019s great for you to be able to ride to work,\u201d McNamara said. \u201cBut equally if you live in the suburbs, as most Londoners do, and you have to get the bus to work, or you\u2019re driving a lorry, it\u2019s not so good.\u201d\\nSome of London\u2019s suburban boroughs, which are less well served by public transport and have higher rates of car ownership, have embraced new cycling and walking schemes, and received \u00a330m from City Hall to become flagship \u201cmini-Hollands\u201d. But others remain resistant: in Barnet, councillor Roberto Weeden-Sanz said the Conservative group would take a stand against the \u201cwar on drivers\u201d by refusing to implement LTNs. Barnet has a proud history of opposing traffic reforms: in 2003, the council\u2019s environment committee chair Brian Coleman ordered the removal of 1,000 speed humps in the borough. A triumphant Telegraph column compared Coleman to Winston Churchill and Field Marshal Montgomery.\\nThere is no evidence that LTNs disproportionately benefit the better-off. A new study has shown that, contrary to one of the most common objections, road closures have not shifted traffic from wealthier areas into more deprived ones. Polling in London has repeatedly shown that more people support LTNs than oppose them. Burke, the former Hackney councillor whose comment about cabbage enraged his opponents, believes that car reduction advocates shouldn\u2019t be afraid of arguments over class. \u201cWhat I\u2019m not willing to do, as someone who comes from a working-class background, is cede an inch of ground to people who have tried to make this a class issue,\u201d he told me. \u201cSeventy percent of the households in Hackney don\u2019t own cars, so why should cars own 100% of the roads? LTNs are an exercise in redistribution.\u201d\\nBut statistics have not dispelled a popular narrative that car reduction measures are unwanted policies imposed by the \u201cmetropolitan elite\u201d on the poor. McNamara is eager to frame car reduction measures as a class war. \u201cAnd let\u2019s be honest \u2013 the working classes are losing badly,\u201d he said.\\nMcNamara is playing on familiar stereotypes. In the 2010s, the folk figure of the hipster had three essential characteristics: a beard, a love of artisan coffee and a fixed-gear bike. The urban cyclist does not cause gentrification, but he becomes a powerful symbol of it. He is able to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing urban environment in a way that established working-class communities are not. He is also visible in a way that the structural causes of the housing crisis are not. As such he \u2013 and his bike \u2013 have become a focus for anger about inequality and displacement.\\nIn his study of cycling culture in the San Francisco Bay Area, the geographer John Stehlin did not find a causal link between bike lanes and gentrification. But he argued that initiatives to make streets more livable, while often motivated by progressive ideals, also became useful marketing tools for developers of high-end housing.\\nHowever, Mohammad Rakib, a community activist in the borough of Tower Hamlets, which borders Hackney to the south and has the highest poverty rates in London, believes LTNs play a more active role in attracting middle-class newcomers to deprived areas and squeezing out the long-term working-class residents. \u201cThese policies are more about social cleansing than they are about reducing pollution,\u201d Rakib told me.\\nRakib sometimes makes memes depicting cyclists as \u201curban colonialists\u201d, combining cycling helmets with the imagery of empire. His point that the users of bike lanes do not reflect the diversity of areas like Tower Hamlets, however, is undeniably true. In 2019, according to TfL research, 85% of cyclists on TfL\u2019s cycle routes were white.\\n\u201cThese areas and communities have waited generations for this level of investment,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that money has been made available, it is not being spent as the community have been asking for it to be spent. LTNs suit a certain class of people who are by no stretch the majority within these areas.\u201d\\nCycling hasn\u2019t always been seen as the preserve of the metropolitan elite. In the mid-20th century, the bicycle was a primary mode of transport for the working class, while the motorcar remained unaffordable to most. In his celebratory 1949 work Leisure (Homage to Jacques-Louis David), the French artist Fernand L\u00e9ger depicted a gang of workers taking a trip out of the city on their bikes \u2013 a vision of the labour-saving potential of the humble bicycle. That same year, 37% of all journeys in Britain were cycled, according to Carlton Reid\u2019s book Bike Boom. From that peak, the figure has fallen to about 2% today.\\nThe mid-20th century is a \u201cwhat if?\u201d moment, where one possible future was blotted out by the ascendancy of the car. In the 1930s, the government planned to vastly expand a national network of cycle routes as well as create a new system of motorways. Both were delayed by the war, and in the end government prioritised the motorways. From the 50s onwards, car ownership became an aspiration of the middle classes and a symbol of a new age of affluence. By the 60s, Britain had become a \u201ccar-owning democracy\u201d, in the words of Simon Digby, the MP for Dorset west at the time.\\nAs cars became more common, so did congestion and pollution. In response, in the 60s transport minister Ernest Marples introduced a raft of new driving restrictions, including yellow lines and parking wardens. Marples said in 1964 that an enraged motorist had once thrown one of his new parking meters through his drawing room window. \u201cI am accused of declaring war on the motorist,\u201d he said in a 1963 speech to the Passenger Transport Association. \u201cThat is a complete travesty of the truth.\u201d\\nDuring the 70s, concerns about the environmental impacts of the car grew, particularly around emissions from leaded petrol. By the time Margaret Thatcher announced that her government would oversee \u201cthe largest road building programme since the Romans\u201d in 1989, a growing ecological movement responded with a series of militant actions, among them a protest camp on the site of the planned M3 expansion at Twyford Down in Hampshire. Almost a year later, the camp was evicted and the motorway was built.\\nOut of this anti-roads scene came a group called Reclaim the Streets, which crashed into public consciousness in May 1995 with a daring piece of street theatre. At a busy traffic intersection in Camden in north London, two cars driven by activists collided. Their drivers got out and began to argue. The argument escalated until both drivers took out sledgehammers and smashed up the cars, creating a DIY barricade and allowing other members of the group to set up a sound system and a children\u2019s play area, turning the busy high street into a carnival. The group, which was immersed in 90s rave culture and the movement against the 1994 Criminal Justice Act, went on to hold dozens of similar events all over the UK.\\n\u201cA year after we were being branded as terrorists, Islington council organised a very similar party to the one we\u2019d hosted,\u201d said one former activist Roger Geffen. \u201cThis idea that you should close city streets to motor vehicles and open them up to people \u2013 it was already starting to go mainstream.\u201d When I asked Chris Knight, a former Reclaim the Streets activist, about the group\u2019s philosophy, he said: \u201cIt was quite simple: kill the car! A car just captures so much: private ownership, privatised space, isolation, egocentrism, deafness to the world around you. \u2018Kill the car\u2019 was just beautiful.\u201d\\nThis group of anarchists and radicals wanted to take back space from cars and promote walking, cycling and public transport for everyday use \u2013 the same ideas that would resurface 25 years later among the policies of a Conservative government. Geffen, now director of policy at advocacy group Cycling UK, exemplifies the way car reduction policies have gone from a fringe belief to the mainstream: his march through the institutions took him from illicit raves and squatting to Buckingham Palace, where he received an MBE for services to cycling in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s been an interesting trajectory,\u201d he said.\\nOn a September evening between lockdowns, I watched a cricket match happening in the middle of Rye Lane, a narrow high street in Peckham, south-east London, which used to be choked with traffic until it was closed to cars by Southwark council in July. A makeshift wicket was set up outside a local institution, Khan\u2019s Bargains, and people spilling out of bars jostled for a chance to bowl. It was exactly the sort of creative use of public space that Reclaim the Streets wanted to inspire, and a rare moment of genuine collective joy.\\nWill we look back on the past year as another \u201cwhat if\u201d moment, a bold but ultimately unsuccessful attempt to reduce the car\u2019s domination of our roads and cities? By the winter of 2020, more than 30 councils across the country had withdrawn or scaled back new traffic-reduction schemes in the face of opposition. Some of these projects were only ever intended to be temporary, but TfL and the boroughs had stated their ambition for new bike lanes and LTNs to become permanent if the data showed they were working effectively.\\nIn December, a few days after Kensington and Chelsea council announced it would scrap a new cycle route along Kensington High Street, a group of Extinction Rebellion activists and cycling campaigners gathered in an attempt to stop the removal of the lane. Wearing hi-vis jackets and carrying placards, a small group of protesters climbed on to construction vans and prevented the workers from pulling out the bollards separating cyclists from the traffic on the busy east-west road. Donnachadh McCarthy, the founder of the Stop Killing Cyclists campaign, told me the group had held protests here before to commemorate cyclists killed in the surrounding area \u2013 15 people have been seriously injured while walking or biking along the high street itself in the past three years \u2013 but this was the first time his group had used such militant tactics.\\nThe following night, after a second protest was dispersed by the police, the council succeeded in removing the bollards. A few weeks later, the route was still busy with cyclists, who now mingled with buses, taxis and high-performance cars. The scars where the bollards used to be were still visible on the asphalt.\\nThe recent reforms suffered another blow in January, when Mrs Justice Beverley Lang ruled that TfL had acted unlawfully in using emergency measures to introduce changes to road layouts. The judge ruled that the process behind the decision to exclude taxis from Bishopsgate and the overarching Streetspace plan were \u201cseriously flawed\u201d and did not recognise the \u201cspecial status\u201d of taxi drivers.\\nThe ruling also found TfL had not sufficiently researched or mitigated the potential adverse impacts of Streetspace projects on taxi passengers with disabilities. Transport for All, a charity advocating for accessible transport, found many disabled people felt \u201ctheir concerns [about LTNs] have been ignored, creating feelings of anger and frustration\u201d. However, the organisation has pointed out that traffic reduction schemes do not necessarily need to be scrapped, but rather modified with features such as tactile paving and exemptions for disabled drivers.\\nTfL points out the ruling did not make any direct findings on the lawfulness of low-traffic neighbourhoods, but with the legality of the Streetspace plan itself in doubt, some councils are worried the judgment could have a wider impact. While most schemes remain in place pending TfL\u2019s appeal, Sutton and Croydon councils have withdrawn LTNs. Sutton council said in a statement: \u201cSome schemes were working well, but we have no choice given the legal judgment.\u201d In June 2021, a separate set of judicial reviews will challenge the future of active travel schemes in the boroughs of Lambeth, Hounslow and Hackney.\\nWith TfL on the back foot in Kensington, cycling advocates have called on the mayor to use his statutory powers to take back control of the high street from the council. At the cyclists\u2019 protest in Kensington in December, the transport historian Christian Wolmar said that the borough\u2019s bike lanes had long been the site of a broader power struggle over the future of the city. As police officers hovered and tried to disperse the protesters, Wolmar recalled the council scrapping cycle lanes in Kensington and Chelsea more than 30 years ago, amid a wider conservative backlash against the leftist policies of the Greater London council, which included an early attempt at a London-wide cycle network. I asked how he felt about having the same arguments 30 years on. \u201cEverything we know about urban planning shows that cities that give themselves to car dominance become less pleasant places to live. Who would want to live in Los Angeles if you could live in Copenhagen, for Christ\u2019s sake?\u201d\\nAcross Europe, increasingly radical car-free policies have been met with vocal opposition. In Paris, a major pedestrianisation scheme faced a protracted court battle (which the scheme ultimately won), while Berlin\u2019s pop-up bike lanes launched during the pandemic faced a legal challenge from the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party.\\nBut when I asked Wolmar if he thought the backlash in London could kill the city\u2019s car reduction plans, he was confident it would not. \u201cThey\u2019ll win a few battles,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they\u2019ll lose the war.\u201d\\nThis article was amended on 25 March 2021. Mention of a 1939 government cycling plan was corrected; some national cycle routes were in place before the war. According to Kensington and Chelsea council, 15 pedestrians and cyclists were seriously injured, not killed, in a three-year period on Kensington High Street.\\nFollow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e0a71455a53189e3d1558313bd97982d175376e/0_267_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=480&dpr=1&s=none", "A new low-traffic neighbourhood area in Tooting, London, August, 2020"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27df7d2e47b523dc939f708f9f501cbf9065002c/0_114_3799_2280/master/3799.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Sadiq Khan, mayor of London, on a new Streetspace cycle lane in London, July 2020"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bb408a37ec8e430eafb89b8b13e24cee597d371/0_229_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Traffic on the A4 Talgarth Road in London, December 2019"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c02aee885a2acd5feac249562c8d5331db1d74a1/0_28_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "An Extinction Rebellion bike ride calling for more cycling and cycle lanes, London, May 2020"]], "author": ["Niamh McIntyre"], "date": "2021-03-25"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/mar/31/sam-lee-the-nightingale-singer": {"title": "Into the woods: Sam Lee, the singer who duets with nightingales", "subtitle": null, "text": "Sam Lee built a studio in a wood, found a nightingale to sing with, hooked up a backing band, and livestreamed their concerts. But it is a race against time \u2013 for the song of the nightingale may soon be lost for ever\\nBuilding your artistic life around duetting with a rare bird that only sings at night for six weeks each year might seem a quixotic quest. But for Sam Lee, folk singer, song collector and environmental activist who has now written his first book, singing with nightingales is, like folksong, \u201ca language of connectedness and enchantment\u201d.\\nThis spring sees the publication of Lee\u2019s book, The Nightingale, alongside a daunting schedule of concerts where the singer dives into the spinneys of England with guest musicians and a small audience to collaborate with the most celebrated of British birds. \u201cI\u2019m there as the agent for the nightingale, to bring people to his thickets to pay our respects,\u201d says Lee from his home in London. \u201cIt\u2019s a journey into how to immerse into nature and be outside in the night-time, which doesn\u2019t happen enough in our lives. And it\u2019s a way of actively putting out gratitude for what we have and what returns \u2013 what creatures make it home.\u201d\\nThe nightingale, as Lee\u2019s book about the bird eloquently explains, is feted not only in British culture but wherever it is found. There are 570 folk songs with the bird in their title, more than any other species apart from the blackbird. The everyday blackbird might make more obviously beautiful music, thinks Lee, but the singing male nightingale (the females don\u2019t sing) is unrivalled because it sings at night and its song is so sophisticated. A blackbird makes 100 different sounds; a nightingale delivers 1,500, and arranges them in more than 250 musical phrases.\\nNightingales are almost overexposed in poetry, but trying to describe its song, writes Lee, is like recounting a dream to a barista the next morning: it doesn\u2019t quite work. Lee tells how Keats\u2019s evocation of a nightingale singing outside his window on Hampstead Heath is widely disparaged, not least by DH Lawrence and John Clare. The latter, thinks Lee, gets closest to conveying the nightingale\u2019s magic \u2013 but the musician himself delivers a fine appreciation of its song.\\n\u201cWhat reveals the nightingale to be such a master musician is his decoration of silence, because silence is such an important part of music,\u201d says Lee. \u201cAnd the best artists are the ones that really know how to work in that space.\u201d Nightingales improvise but also use leitmotifs. They sing with each other too, and with people, as cellist Beatrice Harrison famously demonstrated when she began duetting with nightingales in a series of live BBC broadcasts in the 1920s.\\nLee often hears nightingales passing a shared song along a hedgerow. Very occasionally, he and his concerts have discovered multiple birds singing a complicated song in unison. \u201cIt\u2019s as though they all knew how to sing the same song. People can\u2019t believe it just happened. It\u2019s magic and proof of incredible other senses, and forms of communication, that we are completely tuned out of.\u201d\\nLike every musician, Lee\u2019s collaborations with the migratory nightingale, which flies from sub-Saharan Africa in rapidly-diminishing numbers each April to sing and raise young, endured a year of Covid-related cancellations. His tour to promote last year\u2019s critically acclaimed album Old Wow was scrapped; his book postponed until now. \u201cI lost loads of work, loads of gigs and all my income,\u201d says Lee, with a grimace and a smile, \u201cand I\u2019ve had a wonderful time.\u201d He spent more time in nature with his toddler daughter and swam in rivers he\u2019d always meant to. He also discovered a new way of working online.\\nLast spring, he rapidly turned some nightingale concerts into online broadcasts. Lee built a digital studio in a wood and found a nightingale to sing with, while human collaborators played along from their homes via a live feed. The two feeds were married and broadcast online. \u201cIt allowed me to bring in guests who would have never participated in it,\u201d says Lee. Last year\u2019s Earth Day concert featured Pet Shop Boys, Bernard Butler, Lily Cole and Robert Macfarlane. \u201cSome incredible people embraced it because they could. And so it opened many doors in that sense.\u201d\\nThe door to this way of working was first opened for Lee in childhood, when his parents spotted his love of nature and sent him on summer trips with Forest School Camps, where he learned the joys of bushcraft and singing around a campfire. He spent time with \u201cwilderness teachers\u201d including Ray Mears; later, when he discovered folk music, his mentor was Peter Kennedy, \u201cthe Cecil Sharp of the tape recorder\u201d who went song collecting with David Attenborough in the 1950s.\\nLee remembers being told by folk authorities that all the old oral singers were dead. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like being told, \u2018No, that species is extinct. There\u2019s no more of that particular gecko\u2019. But you\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019ve heard talk from some elders that they\u2019ve seen them out there\u2026\u2019\u201d So Lee travelled to Ireland and Scotland over many summers, finding hundreds of unrecorded singers in Gypsy and Traveller communities. \u201cI loved spending time at the knee of these elders. I could have gone to university and got a music degree and have learned from the textbook or just go to the well and drink from the most incredible source. I was very lucky. I caught an end of an era.\u201d\\nThere are strong parallels between Lee\u2019s quest to record oral folk singers and his nightingale concerts. \u201cWhen I visit a nightingale or go on an expedition to record an elder of a community singing some ancient song that has been passed down through the oral tradition, this is the same thing. It just happens to be a different language of song.\u201d\\nIt\u2019s also a melancholy parallel. These are the end days for both traditions. \u201cI\u2019m hearing a folksong that\u2019s been passed down for maybe 1,000 years and never written down and the last person to ever sing it is in their 80s. And the next time I go back to that caravan site, they\u2019ll probably have passed on. And I often enter nightingale woods and sing with them and know that the chances of a nightingale being here next year is pretty unlikely.\u201d Some concerts have been cancelled in certain places because the bird has become extinct there. \u201cThat\u2019s an end of the line for that community who\u2019ve probably been living there since the ice sheets retreated. That\u2019s a great tragedy. There\u2019s a lot of grief in that.\u201d\\nLee deals with this loss not by \u201cworshipping the ashes\u201d but by \u201ctending the flame\u201d in the words of Gustav Mahler. He\u2019s made his collected folksongs freely available on songcollectors.org; this song trove is waiting to be reinterpreted and revived, and Lee\u2019s next mission is to begin doing so.\\nTending the flame for Lee has also involved creating Extinction Rebellion demonstrations. \u201cTheir journey as a brand new biggest ever community-led organisation in the world is phenomenal,\u201d says Lee but he concedes that, post-Covid, \u201cit\u2019s uncertain what their journey ahead will be\u201d. He\u2019s now working with Music Declares Emergency to seek a carbon-neutral industry. \u201cWe\u2019re living in a time of great transformation. Whether it\u2019s fast enough, I don\u2019t know. But we\u2019re seeing real change at board level in multimillion dollar organisations, and that\u2019s wonderful.\u201d\\nLee\u2019s most immediate act of flame-tending involves committing himself to two months of exhaustion that is sleeping in a tent and singing with the nightingales. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed at two o\u2019clock every night and at 4am the dawn chorus starts and I\u2019m in a tent with no sound insulation. I am beyond tired. By the end of May, I am porous with exhaustion. But I become very emotionally connected. And I go into some funny states of mind.\u201d\\nThis year, England\u2019s emergence from lockdown falls awkwardly in the middle of the April and May nightingale singing season. Camping is allowed before 17 May but campers singing \u2013 a concert \u2013 is not. So Lee is scrambling to ensure some duets are online only while arranging as many nightingale concerts with an in-person audience into the season\u2019s end. \u201cI lost last year and this year I will be even more grateful for every drop of nightingale song that I can squeeze out of the bird.\u201d\\nHis live partnerships are becoming ever more intriguing: Isobel Waller-Bridge (sister of Phoebe), Rihab Azar (London-based Syrian oud player) and Bernard Butler, who produced Old Wow. \u201cThe birds react to personalities and not professionality or Instagram follower numbers,\u201d he says. \u201cThe great thing in curation is sussing out who are the live spirits as musicians who will get it.\\nAnd how does he celebrate the nightingale season\u2019s end? \u201cI do love sleeping in a bed. Closing the curtains and having darkness till 9am is such a luxury.\u201d Lee laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s so great what we\u2019ve done with houses and windows and double glazing.\u201d\\nThe Nightingale by Sam Lee is published by Penguin on 25 March; the audiobook, read by Lee, includes musical elements.

What are the bill\u2019s provisions and why is it generating so much controversy?\\nThe government says the bill, introduced in the Commons last Tuesday, will give the police powers to protect themselves and the public, introduce tougher sentencing and improve the efficiency of the court and tribunal system.\\nThe police will be able to impose conditions such as start and finish times on static protests, powers officers already have in relation to marches. Additionally, senior officers will be able to impose maximum noise limits on protests, with powers to intervene when the noise is disrupting the \u201cactivities of an organisation\u201d or has a \u201crelevant impact on persons in the vicinity\u201d.\\nThe bill also has a specific section on one-person protests, which can also be subject to restrictions by police, based on the noise level, route, disruption etc. It gives the home secretary, Priti Patel, powers to create laws, without parliamentary approval, to define \u201cserious disruption\u201d to communities and organisations, which police can then rely on to impose conditions on protests.\\nIf passed, the legislation will have the effect of curtailing protests near to parliament through provisions that state access for vehicles must not be obstructed.\\nA \u201ckill the bill protest\u201d involving up to 3,000 people in central Bristol on 21 March, turned violent when up to 500 people stoned a police station and burned and damaged police vehicles. At least 20 officers were injured, including two who were treated in hospital. The protests were widely condemned. The mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, said the violence was counterproductive to the campaign of those, like him, who opposed the bill.\\nMinisters say existing public order legislation was passed in 1986 and is no longer fit for managing modern protests, such as those by Extinction Rebellion (XR). Patel has been highly critical of XR and Black Lives Matter (BLM). She described XR as \u201cso-called eco-crusaders turned criminals\u201d and called the BLM protests \u201cdreadful\u201d.\\nOrganisations such as Liberty and the police monitoring group Netpol were quick to criticise the bill as a clampdown on the right to protest, handing too many discretionary powers to the home secretary and police.\\nOpposition has increased after widespread anger at the handling of the Sarah Everard vigils \u2013 both the attempts to prevent the events going ahead and the police response when they did.\\nSince then, Labour has said it will oppose the bill, with the shadow justice minister, David Lammy, saying it was \u201cno time to be rushing through poorly thought-out measures to impose disproportionate controls on free expression\u201d. More than 150 groups, including human rights charities, unions and faith communities, warned it would have a hugely detrimental effect on civil liberties.\\nThe government has been accused of taking advantage of conditions created by the pandemic, which necessitated temporary restrictions on demonstrations, to permanently erode the right of protest.\\nCritics have also pointed out that the 10-year maximum jail term introduced under the bill for people who criminally damage a statue is more than many men get for sexually assaulting or raping a woman. The starting tariff for those found guilty of rape is five years, which the bill does not address.\\nProtesters have carried banners saying \u201c10 years for protest, 5 years for rape\u201d.\\nIt claims the measures in the bill do not undermine freedom of expression but \u201cbalance the rights of protesters with the rights of others to go about their business unhindered\u201d.
