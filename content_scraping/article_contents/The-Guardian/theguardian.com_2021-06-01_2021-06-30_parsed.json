It is the essence of our democracy. To do that, we need to make ourselves heard. The government proposals to allow police to restrict \u2018noisy\u2019 protests are oppressive and wrong.\\n\u201cThe government put forward new powers in areas where the police already have access to powers and offences which are perfectly adequate. The government has served up confusion where clarity and precision is essential.\u201d\\nThe JCHR report published on Tuesday says increased police powers in the bill to restrict static protests, akin to those they hold with respect to marches, should be limited to amending the start and finish time of assemblies. Furthermore, its members describe the proposal to allow the home secretary, Priti Patel, to define \u201cserious disruption\u201d to communities and organisations, which police could then rely on to curb protests, as \u201cunacceptable\u201d.\\nThey say: \u201cIf there is a particular clarification of \u2018serious disruption\u2019 that the Home Office considers is currently needed, perhaps as a result of the Extinction Rebellion (XR) protests of 2019, it should be made clear now so that it can be considered while the bill is being scrutinised. If no need for particular clarification has yet been identified, then we struggle to see how the powers contained in the PCSC bill can be considered necessary.\u201d\\nPatel has previously criticised protests by XR as well as Black Lives Matter, and pledged to prevent the former bringing \u201canarchy on our streets\u201d.\\nThe JCHR says \u201ccurrent rhetoric focuses on the inconvenience sometimes caused by protest rather than its value to society\u201d, warning that any interference with non-violent protests risks rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, under article 10 and 11 respectively of the European convention on human rights. It says the bill should enshrine an explicit right to protest and set out the obligations of the state accordingly.\\nThe parliamentarians express \u201cserious concerns\u201d that a new public nuisance offence contained in the bill could be broader than the common law offence it seeks to replace and fails to give significant weight to the right to protest. They point out that existing laws already deal with public nuisance offences, such as obstructing the highway, and warn the new statutory definition risks deterring demonstrations and \u201ccriminalising a vast number of peaceful protesters\u201d.\\nDemonstrations against the bill have been held across England and Wales, including weeks of protests in Bristol where there were clashes between police and protesters who accused officers of being too aggressive.\\nA Home Office spokesperson said the proposals were backed by the police, \u201care in line with human rights legislation and in no way impinge on the right to protest.\\n\u201cPublic order legislation is out of date, and the use of disruptive and dangerous tactics \u2013 including obstructing emergency vehicles or blocking the free press - costs millions to the taxpayer and causes misery to businesses and local communities.\u201d", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2b134619f05da7ed76e30b24072ed5f6b3a406c/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "The police, crime, sentencing and courts bill has provoked widespread protests."]], "author": ["Haroon Siddique"], "date": "2021-06-22"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/11/quite-a-show-g7-razzmatazz-in-the-air-as-carbis-bay-hosts-world-leaders": {"title": "\u2018Quite a show\u2019: G7 razzmatazz in the air as Carbis Bay hosts world leaders", "subtitle": null, "text": "Opinions are divided about the impact the summit is having on the lives and businesses of St Ives in Cornwall\\nIt was a day of strange juxtapositions and curious culture clashes.

Holidaymakers ate fish and chips and drank pints as thousands of eco protesters marched past the harbour-side restaurants, banging drums, blowing whistles, chanting and singing.\\nA group of teenagers took selfies in front of a burly Royal Navy bomb disposal expert while a character dressed as Batman with the sign: \u201cGive peace a chance\u201d pinned to his back cycled past.\\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that it\u2019s quite a show,\u201d said St Ives mayor, Kirsty Arthur. \u201cG7 is having an impact on just about everybody.\u201d\\nArthur admitted that the arrival of the world leaders had caused inconvenience. It took her an hour and 40 minutes to get back to her home in Carbis Bay, the main venue for the summit, from her work in St Ives, a journey of around a mile. \u201cThat is frustrating.\u201d\\nBut on the other hand, her children, Ruan, five, and Jamie, four, were loving the sight of the military hardware and the buzz around the place. \u201cThey\u2019ll remember it forever,\u201d she said.\\nThree days of G7 protest in St Ives began noisily on Friday at dawn with Rob Higgs and Sophie Miller, co-founders of Ocean Rebellion, sounding a foghorn aimed in the direction of the leaders\u2019 digs in Carbis Bay.\\nThey let out five blasts, signifying danger \u2013 and kept doing it at regular intervals as the day wore on. Higgs explained: \u201cWhat it means is \u2018Fuck we\u2019re going to crash.\u2019 That\u2019s the message we want to get over.\u201d\\nMegan Steeds, who runs a boat hire business on the harbour front, soon tired of the noise. She said her trade was 60% down, with many visitors put off by the signs on the A30 telling people to avoid the area. \u201cThe sooner we get back to normal the better,\u201d she said.\\nOther business people tried to get into the mood. Pengenna Pasties rebranded its offerings: \u201cBiden\u2019s big-un\u201d, \u201cMerkel\u2019s minted lamb\u201d and \u201cMacron\u2019s mixed veg\u201d.\\nSarah Allen, who runs the cafe Sky\u2019s Diner, said it had been quiet in town. \u201cBut it is cool to think that Joe Biden is just over there, across the bay.\u201d\\nRaven Williams, the owner of the Common Wanderer outdoor clothes shop, said the whole event was odd. \u201cI feel that the leaders operate in a different reality to everyday people,\u201d he said.\\n\u201cWhether they represent the needs of the common good is also up for debate \u2013 for all the environmental agendas, flying in wasn\u2019t the best start for Boris to show his love for the planet.\u201d\\nMany others questioned why when a key aim of the summit is to find ways of tackling the climate emergency, it could not have been held remotely.\\nOne holidaymaker was also feeling miffed after driving down to St Ives in an electric car only to be told the charging point he had expected to use was not available because of G7. \u201cI\u2019ve lost faith in the summit and its environmental messages,\u201d he said.\\nThe ring of steel around the venues meant that the only evidence people had that Biden really was in Cornwall were faraway glimpses of his cavalcade as it moved from the Tregenna Castle hotel to Carbis Bay.\\nSo, without a world leader to cheer, the people of St Ives lined the streets to welcome thousands of Extinction Rebellion protesters who met on the hill above the town and embarked on a procession there. The atmosphere was that of a carnival.\\n\u201cGood for them,\u201d said local resident, Karen Walton, \u201cI\u2019d like to join them really. Somebody has to say these things.\u201d\\nThe mood was gentle but there are still concerns that violence could break out over the weekend if other, less peaceful activists arrive.

Cuixart, however, wants the central government to look beyond the next general election \u2013 due in 2023 \u2013 and to heed voices from Catalonia and beyond.\\n\u201cI was sent to prison for defending the exercise of fundamental rights, and I think if the Spanish government has let us out, it was through necessity and not generosity,\u201d he told the Guardian while on his way home to see his wife and children.\\n\u201cI think international pressure, and pressure from Europe and Amnesty International, meant they had to let us out.\u201d\\nCuixart, 46, is already appealing against his conviction at the European court of human rights. Along with fellow civil society leader Jordi S\u00e0nchez, Cuixart was found guilty of sedition by Spain\u2019s supreme court. The pair were arrested two weeks after the illegal, unilateral referendum of 1 October 2017, and accused of orchestrating pro-independence protests that trapped national police inside a Barcelona building and destroyed their vehicles.\\nS\u00e1nchez has described the pardons as an act of clemency needed to help the country turn a page and enter an \u201cera of dialogue and understanding\u201d. But the move remains deeply divisive among voters, among S\u00e1nchez\u2019s political rivals \u2013 and even among those who have received the pardons.\\nThe separatist leaders have vowed to carry on pushing for regional independence and say a blanket amnesty would have been preferable to the individual pardons. They also insist that an officially agreed referendum remains the best way to settled the vexed Catalan question.\\nCuixart says that dialogue remains essential: \u201cOur politicians here and in Madrid need to talk \u2013 that\u2019s why people voted for them.\u201d He also acknowledges that S\u00e1nchez\u2019s gestures to date suggest a far more conciliatory approach to Catalonia than that of his conservative predecessor, Mariano Rajoy. But he brushes off suggestions that the Socialist-led government has a wholly new approach to the problem.\\n\u201cForgive me, but after spending three years in prison under Pedro S\u00e1nchez and one year there under Rajoy, Pedro S\u00e1nchez had enough time to fix this,\u201d said Cuixart.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken him three years \u2013 and that\u2019s no small thing! OK, we\u2019re out of prison and the tone from Pedro S\u00e1nchez is clearly not the one we heard from Mariano Rajoy \u2026 But we have to move from words to action.\u201d\\nLike his fellow independence leaders, Cuixart points to a Scottish-style referendum as his greatest hope. \u201cWhen Pedro S\u00e1nchez is David Cameron, maybe we\u2019ll make some progress,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat Pedro S\u00e1nchez has to do is act bravely and not engage in short-term dodges. He has to think about future generations and not just about parliamentary stability over the next two years. I don\u2019t want to presuppose that he won\u2019t do that. We\u2019re always open to dialogue.\u201d\\nAlthough a majority of Catalans continue to oppose independence \u2013 the split is currently 48.7% against to 44.9% in favour, according to a recent poll \u2013 approximately 70% of people in Catalonia would like to see a referendum on the issue. S\u00e1nchez, however, has repeatedly ruled out a vote on secession, insisting that all negotiations must respect the law and the constitution.\\n\u201cThose jailed were never punished for their ideas, but for their actions against democratic legality,\u201d the prime minister said on Tuesday. \u201cA strong democracy like Spain\u2019s doesn\u2019t ask anyone to abandon their ideas, but it does require them to exercise them within the limits of the law and with respect towards all Spaniards.\u201d\\nCuixart declined to say whether he endorsed the view recently expressed by another of those pardoned, the former Catalan regional vice-president Oriol Junqueras. At the beginning of June, Junqueras wrote an article recognising the mistakes the independence movement had made and suggesting that unilateral efforts to secure independence were now \u201cneither viable nor desirable\u201d.\\n\u201cAs part of \u00d2mnium, I can\u2019t say that I made a mistake by trying to pressure Catalan and Spanish politicians to let us vote,\u201d said Cuixart. \u201cI\u2019ve pressured everyone by saying, \u2018Please, we want to vote.\u2019 That what Extinction Rebellion have done, that\u2019s what gender equality campaigners have done. I\u2019m an activist and the only way I have of getting people to listen to me is by pressuring politicians \u2013 peacefully and democratically.\u201d\\nAsked whether he saw Catalan independence as a short-, medium- or long-term endeavour, Cuixart said the past four years had only reinforced his vision. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of exercising fundamental rights, which is what happened in Quebec, what\u2019s happening in Scotland, and what happened in the UK with Brexit,\u201d he said.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s about listening to the voice of the people. Although it may seem that the Spanish government is refusing to budge, I think civil society will keep up the pressure so that this referendum happens sooner rather than later so that Catalonia can freely decide what its political future will be.\u201d", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c52fa59633ffb271b2c44051b35b5f1b62cf630/0_414_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Jordi Cuixart"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9ce29876e6782e9f3ed330204e6ecefca521321/0_111_3500_2175/master/3500.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Oriol Junqueras, Joaquim Forn, Josep Rull, Raul Romeva, Jordi Sanchez and Jordi Cuixart"]], "author": ["Sam Jones"], "date": "2021-06-23"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/30/deep-sea-mining-could-start-in-two-years-after-pacific-nation-of-nauru-gives-un-ultimatum": {"title": "Deep-sea mining could start in two years after Pacific nation of Nauru gives UN ultimatum", "subtitle": null, "text": "The International Seabed Authority has two years to finalise regulations governing the controversial industry\\nDeep-sea mining has been given the go-ahead to commence in two years, after the tiny Pacific island nation of Nauru notified the UN body governing the nascent industry of plans to start mining.\\nTriggering the so-called \u201ctwo-year rule\u201d, which some have called the nuclear option, the International Seabed Authority (ISA) now has two years to finalise regulations governing the controversial industry.\\nIf it is unable to do so, the ISA is required to allow mining contractors to begin work under whatever regulations are in place at the time.\\nNauru\u2019s president, Lionel Aingimea, notified the ISA of the intention of Nauru Ocean Resources Inc (NORI), a subsidiary of a Canadian company called DeepGreen, to apply for approval to begin mining in two years in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the North Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and Mexico.\\nAingimea\u2019s letter, dated 25 June, asked the ISA \u201cto complete the adoption of rules, regulations, and procedures required to facilitate the approval of plans of work for exploitation in the area within two years\u201d from 30 June.\\nNauru believed draft deep-sea mining regulations were nearly complete after seven years of talks, Aingimea\u2019s letter said.\\nEnvironmental groups, the EU Parliament, several Pacific nations including Fiji and Papua New Guinea, and Sir David Attenborough, have called for a moratorium on deep-sea mining, arguing that too little is known about its impact.\\nLast week, more than 350 scientists from 44 countries signed a petition calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining \u201cuntil sufficient and robust scientific information has been obtained\u201d.\\nJessica Desmond, Oceans campaigner for Greenpeace Aotearoa, said: \u201cWe are currently in the middle of a climate and biodiversity crisis, we know that deep sea ecosystems are some of the most important ecosystems on the planet and we are seeing this relentless and reckless push to mine these areas, despite the fact that scientists are very clearly warning us that the outcomes could be disastrous.\u201d\\n\u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing, it\u2019s very foolhardy\u2026 and very dangerous,\u201d said Duncan Currie, an international lawyer who has worked in oceans law for 30 years. He represents the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition which is calling for a moratorium on deep sea mining.\\nCurrie said the two-year rule was designed to be used if a country was ready to mine and then found their path to do so blocked by a few countries in the ISA, or if progress toward adopting regulations to govern deep-sea mining had stalled, but that neither situation was the case.\\n\u201cA very important consultation is happening next week,\u201d said Currie, in reference to a 3 July deadline for responses to draft standards and guidelines. \u201cThey can hardly complain that things aren\u2019t happening when they\u2019re happening next week.\\n\u201cIf we\u2019re in a situation where a company has tested all their equipment and they\u2019re frustrated by the regulatory environment, we might expect to see this, but we haven\u2019t seen that.\u201d\\nDeepGreen is looking to extract polymetallic nodules from the seabed. The nodules, which resemble potatoes and are thought to take millions of years to form, are rich in manganese, nickel, cobalt and rare earth metals, key components of batteries for electric vehicles.

Some of the new routes were served by other airlines, including Stobart Air, which recently went bust.\\nMost of them are viable by train, or train and ferry, but rail operators charge far higher prices and some of the journeys take longer on the UK\u2019s current rail service. The government is to make reductions in air passenger duty on domestic flights, which will make flying even cheaper compared with train journeys.\\nThe UK government\u2019s stance is in sharp contrast with France, which is banning flights where a train journey is available that takes less than 2.5 hours.\\nJohn Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said the move showed that the government was not taking seriously its targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 68% by 2030, and 78% by 2035, which have been key commitments in the runup to the Cop26 UN climate talks in Glasgow this November.\\nHe said: \u201cDomestic flights have long been a symbol of how our economic system incentivises our own destruction. Companies like easyJet claim to take sustainability seriously, but their announcement of 12 new domestic routes shows they will not prioritise our planet\u2019s health over their profits until they are forced to do so by law. The UK government claims to be a climate leader but is considering lowering taxes on domestic flights despite them being cheaper than train fares on many routes. What will it take to make ministers understand that you can\u2019t hit carbon reduction targets without carbon reduction policies?\u201d\\nCampaigners have warned that a series of recent actions by the government appear to undermine the UK\u2019s green commitments ahead of Cop26, including a proposed new coalmine in Cumbria, the scrapping of the green homes grant insulation programme, slashing the incentives for electric cars, and the cutting of overseas aid, which experts said undermined the UK\u2019s credibility at the G7 summit, where climate was a major issue.\\nAn easyJet spokesperson said: \u201cThe new routes which will operate this summer have been introduced in response to the demand we\u2019re seeing for domestic air travel in the UK and as with all our flights, we offset all of the carbon emissions from the fuel used for them.\u201d\\nShe said the company was also using more efficient aircraft and \u201csupporting the development of radical new technologies to achieve zero-emission flying in the future, which we are committed to transitioning to as soon as they are available\u201d.\\nSuch technologies are likely to be decades away, however, and green campaigners point out that carbon output in the next 10 years will be crucial. Scientists calculate that the world must halve carbon emissions by 2030 to have a chance of staying below 1.5C of global heating.\\nEasyJet has been one of the biggest beneficiaries from the government\u2019s cash schemes to keep companies afloat during the pandemic, drawing on loans of about \u00a32bn from the public purse. Ministers refused to place \u201cgreen strings\u201d on the cash to ensure recipients met environmental targets, as some other governments have done.\\nSauven said: \u201cThe pandemic has put the UK government firmly in charge of the aviation industry, as it now needs huge amounts of public money to survive.

Very rarely are things achieved at these summits. The best thing about them is the opportunity to laugh at the photographs, which somehow are even more excruciating than the usual political photo ops.\\nSo, without further ado \u2026\\nI\u2019ve never related to anyone as much as I do to this little girl. During Boris Johnson\u2019s trip to St Issey primary school, this poor wee lamb was clearly sacrificed to the photo op. She does not look happy about it. On the other hand, there\u2019s a vibe of a sweet movie detailing the journey of a single father and his young charge, fending for themselves after the tragic death of, respectively, their wife and mother. Though Johnson in the role of responsible adult would clearly be a monumental departure.\\nJill Biden\u2019s jacket is widely assumed to be a rejoinder to Melania Trump\u2019s one emblazoned with \u201cI Really Don\u2019t Care, Do U?\u201d. It\u2019s debatable how subtle capital diamant\u00e9 letters are, but the sentiment of love is very much appreciated. Biden is a good egg; I like her a lot. That said, this blazer isn\u2019t the sort of thing one would buy out of choice, but rather looks like an emergency purchase on a foreign holiday when caught out by the weather \u2013 the least awful item on the town square market.\\nI don\u2019t know when it was that Justin Trudeau started morphing into Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, but it\u2019s undeniable. Kind of makes you think that the Johnsons could have just enlisted his help rather than pay for \u2013 sorry, get someone else to pay for \u2013 their \u00a3200,000 Lulu Lytle flat renovation.\\nNot a still from Reservoir Dogs, but, in fact, the arrival of The Adults: Angela Merkel and her university professor husband, Joachim Sauer. Merkel is having a tough time and is on her way out in Germany, probably looking forward to a break from keeping control of the kindergarten that counts as the people who run the world.\\nBecause Merkel is sensible and mostly competent, she is often unfairly portrayed as dull. Yet she\u2019s always coming out with controlled, withering sass. Remember when Vladimir Putin tried to intimidate her with his dogs? Her response: \u201cI understand why he has to do this \u2013 to prove he\u2019s a man. He\u2019s afraid of his own weakness.\u201d\\nI don\u2019t mean to be rude, but what is this backdrop? Because that looks rather like a painting of logs. Biden seems to be offering Johnson some sage advice here. Possibly: don\u2019t stuff straws under your top lip and pretend to be a walrus over dinner, as I know you\u2019re almost certainly planning to do, because you are a clown.\\nSome of you may recall that photograph in which Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter seemed Borrower-sized next to the Bidens, because of the unfortunate effects of a wide-angle lens. But this photograph rather suggests that it is Jill who is the size of a Monopoly piece.\\nThis is the most awkward photograph of all time, but there is something endearing about it. Usually, G7 group photographs that involve tables are taken in stately dining halls, with gold chandeliers and snow-white tablecloths, but here we have European commission president Ursula von der Leyen, French president Emmanuel Macron, European Council president Charles Michel, Merkel and Italy\u2019s prime minister, Mario Draghi, crammed around a picnic table. It almost certainly has a wobbly leg and a sticky surface. It is about half the size it needs to be. The authentic British experience.\\nI know people find protesters annoying, but various groups have absolutely knocked it out of the park in Cornwall. Yes, there are the usual Amazon-bought politician masks and blow-up Boris Johnsons, plus garb inspired by The Handmaid\u2019s Tale \u2013 same old \u2013 but we\u2019ve also been treated to Extinction Rebellion dressing as GIANT BLACKBIRDS doing some kind of play. Oh, and if you\u2019re wondering if that\u2019s a warship in the background, it is. Because this is the country we\u2019re living in.\\nHere is a group of Pikachus on the beach in an attempt to get the Japanese government to stop burning coal by 2030. I would genuinely find this quite persuasive.\\nGod bless you, sir. Taking Jill Biden\u2019s message to heart.\\nI don\u2019t quite understand the logic of putting a cut-down tree stump front and centre at a summit partly dedicated to saving the environment, but bear in mind that Johnson took a flight from London to Cornwall, so the message seems skewed all round.\\nFinally, thank God for the arrival of Brigitte Macron, the wife of Emmanuel, who is always the most entertaining presence at G7 summits. Yesterday, there was no sign of her; I quickly discovered she was in Paris hanging out with the French football star Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. As you can see, she does not look pleased to have been dragged away, sporting an expression that can only be described as \u201cthis shit again\u201d.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\\nIt is less a hazelnut chocolate spread (other brands are available but, honestly, have you ever tried them?) than a global phenomenon. One that has turned its Italian parent company, Ferrero, into a circa \u20ac12bn-a-year business, created a secondary market in jar locks and resonates in the news cycle in endlessly unexpected ways: from the pre-match snacking of Brentford FC midfield \u201cmachine\u201d Vitaly Janelt to (and, no, the date on this is not 1 April) plans to sterilise Britain\u2019s grey squirrel population.\\nWith the exception of the Guardian\u2019s own Felicity Cloake \u2013 a heretic who recommends making your own \u2013 Nutella is seemingly irresistible to humans and animals alike. Not bad for a creation whose origins lie, twice over, in war, privation and improvisation. Napoleonic trade bans restricted cocoa\u2019s availability in 19th-century Piedmont, inspiring the first gianduja or gianduiotto blends with local hazelnuts. In similar circumstances after the second world war, the Ferrero family created its own cocoa and hazelnut mix which, in 1964, became the easily spreadable SuperCrema version of Nutella which \u2013 recipe tweaks aside \u2013 we know today.\\nThe smooth brand has encountered bumps in the road. But, since 2015, criticism of Nutella\u2019s use of palm oil has largely subsided after the then French environment minister, S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, was forced into an embarrassing public apology. Royal had called for a Nutella boycott but, among others, Greenpeace leapt to Ferrero\u2019s defence, stating that it is leading the way in terms of sustainability, transparency and regulation of palm oil production. Ferrero (which says it uses just 0.3% of global palm oil each year) was the best-rated manufacturer on the 2020 WWF Palm Oil Scorecard.\\nThere are other reasons, perhaps, to not wantonly scarf Nutella. It is 56.3% sugar and 80 calories per 15 grams (not unlike jams, for reference). So, if it is best enjoyed as an infrequent indulgence you had better optimise your use of it. That is where How to Eat \u2013 the series exploring how to wring maximum pleasure from Britain\u2019s favourite foods \u2013 can help. Welcome to the Nutella hierarchy.\\nCold, from the jar\\n\u201cDO NOT STORE IN THE FRIDGE\u201d orders the label, bossily. But for an exceptional Nutella experience, ignore that. It\u2019s true: in the fridge, Nutella hardens into a solid, user-unfriendly lump. But, perversely, unlike most foods (which, flavour-wise, come alive as they warm; it\u2019s a volatile compounds thing), Nutella is most exquisite served cold. Silky smooth, melting instantly in the mouth, its ganache-like quality \u2013 rich, dense, intense, layered \u2013 is one which, in Michelin-starred restaurants is only achieved at great cost in time, money and emotional anguish. Here it is in a jar, \u00a31.70 for 200g. True, you might have to wrap a tea towel around your hand to help you hack at the hardened Nutella with a spoon. Also true: once you discover refrigerated Nutella you might find it difficult to ever go into the kitchen again without eating it. But licked from a teaspoon, slowly \u2013 go full \u201ctantric chocolate\u2019, here \u2013 it is sensational. Where warm Nutella is slightly too sickly sweet, cooling it punches up its nuttiness so that (dangerously), it is far more moreish. It makes the idea of putting Nutella on anything seem almost redundant.\n   Ice-creamFrom Calpol syringes to caramel-based sauces, a surprising amount of energy is expended online trying to render Nutella in a pourable form. Heating it in a bowl of hot water or microwaving it (try 15- to 20-second increments), will produce a runnier consistency if not a pouring sauce exactly. Do not be tempted to hammer it in the microwave for minutes on end. Instead of a sauce, you will end up with a smouldering, carbonised chunk that could pass as recently landed asteroid debris. However, in HTE\u2019s opinion, heating Nutella is a retrograde step. Warmed, Nutella has a thinner texture and a narrower flavour profile. Better to simply spoon room-temperature Nutella on to vanilla ice-cream, and accept it won\u2019t quite ooze into its crevices but will taste of more. A smaller two-scoops-and-a-blob serve is wise: too much Nutella and ice-cream gets cloying quick. The cold temperatures and all that fat in the mouth means the Nutella does not quite sing with the full fervour it does when served au naturel, but it definitely works in a quick dessert kind of way.\\nToast\n Eating Nutella on anything but the most bland, white Chorleywood bread is an act of deep self-loathing. Worthy brown, seeded and/or wholemeal throw gritty bran into what should be the smooth-gear interaction of butter and Nutella. Yet, somewhat contradictorily (and unlike the banana and Nutella sandwich, below), eating Nutella plain on untoasted white sliced creates a juvenile, sweet, gummy mouthful that quickly gets nauseating. Toasted white bread is much better. Toasting dials down the bread\u2019s sweetness, gives it a tempering, savoury edge. But, in truth, compared with what is possible in the banana sandwich, it\u2019s all a bit one-note.\\nBanana and Nutella sandwichA symphony of flavours that interact with rare mutual sympathy. The bread must be soft, white, milky and thin. Do not toast it. The banana adds lubrication and freshness that makes toasting unnecessary, damaging even. The flavours interlock such that the butter\u2019s saltiness is emphasised which, in turn, seems to bring a new brightness and contrast to the Nutella. Meanwhile, the banana, as well as creating layers of differential creaminess with the butter, acts as a palate-cleansing reset at the end of each mouthful, refreshing the sandwich in a way that means it works, without becoming too much, to the last bite. Note: do not be tempted to trowel on butter and chocolate spread. A thin screed of each is ideal.\\nCroissantNot the worst way to eat Nutella. But, texturally, HTE prefers to eat its croissant with a few squares of block chocolate. All but the freshest, most lubricious croissant will become a slog if larded with gluey Nutella.Waffles and/or French toastBafflingly rich, sweet, stodgy foods. The addition of Nutella, even more so than whipped cream, compounds this problem. \u201cGalumphing, maximalist cooking that makes you long for delicacy, refinement and finesse,\u201d says HTE, the column that eats Nutella straight from the jar.Pancakes\n  Treat the laciest French crepe to a thin layer of Nutella and that works. But a big pile of thick, US-style pancakes, smothered in Nutella? That\u2019s a clag-fest of rapidly diminishing returns.As a dip for fresh fruitThat has an unmistakable, unappealing 1970s feel. Dipping fruit into softened Nutella brings two great things together and ruins both. Although it is not as leftfield as serving chocolate spread on a charcuterie board to pair with the cheese. Or adding it to a grilled cheese sandwich.On a sweet pizzaNo. The end. Never. And don\u2019t come at HTE with obscure Italian dessert pizza traditions, as if that justifies anything. This is not a matter of authenticity, it is a matter of common sense.\\nServed straight from the spoon? Then likely every time you walk into the kitchen. You have been warned. Otherwise, Nutella works any time \u2013 breakfast (toast); dinner (banana sandwich); tea (ice-cream) \u2013 you feel that Covid-19/late-stage capitalism/life is squeezing your skull to the extent that you need a momentary lift, a boost, a jolt of pleasure to remind you you are alive.\\nA huge mug of tea: a titanic tidal wave of tannins to sluice the decks clean of all that sugar and fat. Nutella and a decent brew are true comrades.\\nSo, Nutella, how do you eat yours?", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a96cbc7d21f24a3963f10d8596b0afea0e56b14/0_230_4754_2853/master/4754.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Nutella"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1126b1b6de9f2031f57daeb68af3e98d95606e5/0_261_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Nutella"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83db1c53f499a240bede7db224a90bbdedcaecbc/0_192_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Nutella toast"], ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc1bf30344898b878e4fee92b469e7f17087dd0e/0_300_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none", "Nutella"]], "author": ["Tony Naylor"], "date": "2021-06-18"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2021/jun/11/g7-signs-of-protest-in-cornwall-in-pictures": {"title": "G7 signs of protest in Cornwall \u2013 in pictures", "subtitle": null, "text": "Policing protests taking place around the G7 summit will be challenging, officers have said.

While Terrence Malick loved filming American cornfields at the hallowed \u201cmagic hour\u201d, this awkward hybrid prefers loitering at what you might call \u201cmorbid hour\u201d, with Korean cinematographer Eun-ah Lee bathing everything in sallow, deathly light. The blight beneath everyone\u2019s feet is creeping into their hearts.\\nSet in rural Pennsylvania, Unearth is a tale of two houses: the Lomacks and the Dolans. Beer-chugging divorcee dad George Lomack (Marc Blucas) is struggling to provide for his two daughters with a failing auto-mechanic business; dollar signs light up in his eyes when a gas-extraction outfit called Patriot Exploration comes calling with an offer for his land. This is much to the horror of Kathryn Dolan (Adrienne Barbeau, on fearsome form), matriarch of the neighbouring clan, who is fighting to keep her land productive, and whose photographer daughter Christina (Allison McAtee) likes blowing off some steam amid the corncobs with pent-up George.\\nThe film takes considerable care delving into these dynastic undercurrents, complete with a doomy biblical undertow. \u201cIf you make a tree good, its fruit will be good. You make a tree bad, its fruit\u2019s gonna be bad,\u201d augurs Kathryn. So makes it all the more jarring when Unearth explodes with little warning into full-on suppurating-wound, tendril-spouting eco horror for the final 20 minutes.

Take daily Covid tests, wear masks at appropriate times and respect everything from one-way systems around venues to limits on how many people can gather around a table for a meal or drink.\\nWelcome to G7 UK 2021, the first world summit in the times of Covid.\\nIt will be extraordinary in many ways. The setting, for a start. The Cornish seaside village of Carbis Bay and the towns of St Ives and Falmouth are the main focus, but expect beaches and tourist attractions to be used as backdrops.\\nSecurity is paramount. Warships are anchored off the coast and UK and US military aircraft are circling above. Police and secret service personnel are rubbing shoulders with holidaymakers.\\nThousands of protesters will make their voices heard with demonstrations planned on beaches, at sea and in the streets. Residents are bracing themselves for noise, disturbance and traffic chaos.\\nThe twists of the pandemic made the UK and other G7 members wary about pressing ahead with the face-to-face summit, but it is seen as part of a wider opening-up of diplomacy to in-person meetings.\\nSaudi Arabia was deeply disappointed when its G20 summit last year took place online, and G7 has always been regarded as a \u201cfireside chat\u201d, which would lose its impact and worth if done remotely.\\nThere have been concessions. There was a plan for a Buckingham Palace banquet but the Queen opposed this, not thinking a lavish dinner was appropriate and fearing it could have been a potential super-spreader event. Joe Biden is settling for tea with her.\\nStill, a growing concern among Cornish people is that the summit could lead to an outbreak of Covid in an area with one of the lowest rates in the UK.\\nThe deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats in Tory-controlled Cornwall, Colin Martin, said it was misleading to suggest all foreign visitors would be in a secure bubble. \u201cCornwall is one of the safest places but all this could be put at risk by crowds of politicians and journalists landing at Newquay airport and travelling around,\u201d he said.\\nCornwall\u2019s director of public health, Rachel Wigglesworth, accepted that holding such an event during a pandemic came with \u201cclear public health challenges\u201d. She said all attenders needed to provide a negative Covid result before they arrived and then do daily lateral flow tests.\\nCornwall council was firm: \u201cThere will be no blind eyes turned when it comes to following the basic rules.\u201d\\nAll this may make things like dining arrangements tricky. How will the seven G7 leaders be able to eat together when in England no more than six people are allowed to meet indoors at a pub or restaurant?\\nThe Cabinet Office said: \u201cAll attendees and delegations will be required to follow UK public health regulations throughout the meeting. We will require them to respect strict Covid-secure measures.\u201d\\nAsked if this meant leaders could only dine as a group of up to six, the Cabinet Office said only: \u201cLeaders will also follow public health guidance.\u201d\\nMeanwhile, the security operation is in full flow. About 6,500 police officers from across the UK are on duty, one-fifth of them housed on a cruise ship anchored off Falmouth.\\nThere are 1,000 police vehicles on the streets of Cornwall, 150 dogs standing by and 18 police drones. Officers are armed with guns, baton rounds, stun guns, smoke and stun grenades and incapacitant spray.\\nThe Royal Navy ships HMS Tyne and HMS Tamar are among the vessels that lie off the Cornish coast.\\nBut most of the security is not obvious. For every visible naval ship or armed police officer, you can be sure there are many more special forces operatives. For every local police chief put up as a talking head, there are many dozens of security services specialists in London, GCHQ and Washington.\\nPerhaps optimistically, four \u201cofficial\u201d protest sites have been set up, two in Cornwall (Truro and Falmouth) and two in Devon (Plymouth and Exeter). But in the main, protesters will shun them and try to get as close to the leaders and media as possible.\\nThe demonstrations will be many and varied. On Friday, young people from the Cornwall Youth Climate Alliance are organising a strike for schoolchildren on Gyllyngvase beach in Falmouth.\\nExtinction Rebellion (XR) is planning protest through art, music and dance on beaches, at sea and in St Ives and Falmouth. About 500 people have arrived at its campsite in St Ives.\\nA group called Resist G7, which includes the likes of the Anarchist Federation, Penzance Socialists and the Stop the War Coalition, is holding three days of protest including a \u201ckill the bill\u201d march on Sunday. Like XR, it is asking people to take a Covid test before travelling, and passing on the public health advice that everyone connected to G7 should take daily tests.\\nSome residents ask if it is worth it. The government has announced what it calls a \u201cG7 legacy\u201d, including town deals worth more than \u00a365m for St Ives, Penzance and Camborne (though political opponents argue this is not really new as it was known the money was in the pipeline).\\nThe Rev Chris Wallis, the coordinator of the St Ives food bank, said he feared that the attention the G7 summit would bring would disadvantage less well-off locals. \u201cIt will make house prices worse in this area. It will certainly make poverty worse for those that are trying to live here.\u201d\\nMichael Davies, a shop worker who lives in Carbis Bay, said he worried about the disruption. \u201cBut I think overall there\u2019s a mixture of excitement and apprehension.

However, companies that emit carbon dioxide can avoid paying the tax by buying carbon offsets from Colombian emission reduction projects, including those that conserve threatened natural carbon banks such as peatlands, forests and mangrove swamps.\\nAccording to the report, a new analysis of large-scale forest protection schemes in the Colombian Amazon by Carbon Market Watch claims that they may be dramatically overstating their impact on preventing deforestation. The report warns that millions of carbon credits have likely been generated with no benefit to the climate.\\nIt finds the issue of \u201chot air\u201d carbon credits from forest protection schemes in Colombia could be the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d, with 75 similar projects permitted to sell credits under the country\u2019s domestic tax system.\\nAbout 5m credits have been bought from the projects considered in the report, nearly all by Primax Colombia SAS, a fossil fuel company covered by the carbon tax. This would represent a loss of about $25m to the government, according to the report, which has been published as part of an investigation with the Latin American Center for Investigative Journalism (CLIP).\\nCarbon Market Watch, an accredited observer of UN climate negotiations, has called on Verra, a US nonprofit which administers the world\u2019s leading carbon credit standard used by one of the projects analysed in the report, to suspend the scheme from their registry.\\nThe analysis comes amid growing concern over the environmental integrity of emission reductions from forest protection schemes approved by Verra, frequently used by major polluters to substantiate \u201cnet zero\u201d and \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d claims.\\nLast month, an investigation by the Guardian and Unearthed, Greenpeace\u2019s investigative journalism unit, into 10 schemes approved by Verra found they face a significant credibility problem, with experts warning the system is not fit for purpose.\\nVerra is in the process of reviewing its rules for its Redd+ projects but has so far ruled out retrospectively cancelling credits that have already been approved.\\nGilles Dufrasne, policy officer at Carbon Market Watch, said: \u201cThis scandal is yet another striking example of carbon market standards failing to uphold environmental integrity of offset projects. It harms the climate, reduces government revenues and threatens the continuation of climate finance payments from international donors. We hear time and again that the voluntary carbon market helps countries go beyond their existing climate commitment, but here it has actually undermined national efforts.\u201d\\nForest protection schemes, known as Redd+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation), generate credits by preventing environmental destruction against a baseline often based on historical loss.\\nConcerns that projects were producing \u201chot air\u201d credits by exaggerating their environmental impact by using dramatic deforestation baselines have long dogged Redd+ projects and in 2018, the Colombian environment ministry introduced rules requiring schemes to comply with a national baseline development by the government, known as a forest reference emission level (FREL).\\nThe report said some schemes are not using the national baseline and are claiming credits against a much higher deforestation scenario, probably producing credits of little benefit to the climate. While more finance for forest conservation is needed, Carbon Market Watch said it could not come at the expense of environmental integrity.\\nVerra said the analysis was methodologically flawed. A spokesperson said: \u201cIt compares the project\u2019s baseline to the country\u2019s Forest Reference Emission Level (FREL), but the assessment of Colombia\u2019s FREL by the UNFCCC has not yet been finalised, and in any event a FREL represents an average across an entire country or region and is not site-specific.\\n\u201cVerra emphasises that all VCS projects follow approved methodologies and are validated by independent third-party auditors. All emission reductions and removals are verified by such auditors as well.\u201d\\nIn response to the report, the Colombian environment ministry said it was developing a strategy to strengthen the integrity of the current system by improving the environmental credibility of the carbon market and governance of the carbon tax exemption mechanism, among other measures.\\nIn a statement, Primax Colombia said they bought the carbon credits in compliance with the government\u2019s tax rules, and that the responsibility for verifying the environmental credibility of the offsets belongs to the validation and verification bodies.\\nThis article was amended on 23 July 2021 to include a response from Primax Colombia received after publication.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ebc0887228d2f446a3f507057e59df632a503d2/0_204_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "People hold a mock coffin with the words \u2018Our Amazon\u2019 in a demonstration during the youth global climate strike in Cali, Colombia, in September 2019.

The UK\u2019s economy would lose 6.5% a year by 2050 on current policies and projections, compared with 2.4% if the goals of the Paris climate agreement are met.\\nOther nations will be hit much worse, including India, whose economy will shrink by a quarter owing to a 2.6C temperature increase, while Australia will suffer a loss of 12.5% of output, and South Korea will lose nearly a tenth of its economic potential.\\nThe leaders of the G7 countries \u2013 the UK, the US, Japan, Canada, France, Germany, Italy \u2013 and the EU will meet in Cornwall on Friday to discuss the global economy, Covid-19 vaccines, taxes on business, and the climate crisis.\\nThe modelling by the insurance firm Swiss Re took account of the forecast direct impacts of climate breakdown, including extreme weather such as droughts and floods, as well as the effects on agricultural productivity, health and heat stress.\\nJerome Haegeli, group chief economist at Swiss Re, said: \u201cClimate change is the long-term number one risk to the global economy, and staying where we are is not an option \u2013 we need more progress by the G7. That means not just obligations on cutting CO2 but helping developing countries too, that\u2019s super-important.\u201d\\nHe said vaccines for Covid-19 were also a key way to help developing countries, as their economies were hit hard by the pandemic and would need help to recover on a green path, rather than through boosting fossil fuels.\\nThe insurer found that policies and pledges by governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions were still inadequate to meet the goals of the Paris agreement. As well as hosting the G7 summit, the UK will host vital UN climate talks, called Cop26, this November in Glasgow.\\nPressure on the UK as Cop26 approaches\\nCampaigners and climate experts have been increasingly concerned about a series of government actions that appear to be out of step with the government\u2019s commitment to net zero emissions, ahead of hosting vital UN climate talks, called\u00a0Cop26, this November in Glasgow. As host and president of the talks, the UK will have to bring squabbling nations together to\u00a0agree to slash emissions drastically in the next ten years, and reach net zero emissions by mid-century.\\nRebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said the government must reject airport expansion to show leadership at Cop26: \u201cIf true, pausing the plans is a sign that the government is starting to clock the catastrophic impacts of this proposed expansion. But we\u2019re just months away from hosting critical global climate talks, and this climate-wrecking mega project is clearly incompatible with our plans to cut emissions, so why only delay the decision and not just call it in now? Quashing the expansion plans before the global climate summit begins would be a real show of climate leadership.\u201d\\nGreen groups\u00a0received assurances from civil servants in 2019\u00a0that decisions on new infrastructure that could increase greenhouse gas emissions would take account of the government\u2019s target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. However, the\u00a0supreme court ruled last December\u00a0that the government\u2019s commitments under the\u00a02015 Paris agreement\u00a0could effectively be ignored in the decision to press ahead with a third runway at Heathrow.\\nA group of more than 130 prominent scientists, academics and lawyers, including former Nasa scientist James Hansen, and UK former chief scientist Sir David King, last week\u00a0wrote to the government expressing concern over the supreme court ruling, and warning that the government\u2019s international climate commitments were being ignored. They wrote: \u201cThe highest court in the UK has set a precedent that major national projects can proceed even where they are inconsistent with maintaining the temperature limit on which our collective survival depends. Indeed, the precedent goes further still. It says that the government is not bound even to consider the goals of an agreement that is near universally agreed. Not only does that undermine the UK\u2019s status as a champion of the Paris agreement just ahead of Cop26. It also substantially reduces humanity\u2019s prospects of maintaining that limit and hence averting disaster.\u201d\\nOther recent controversial decisions, such as the government\u2019s initial backing for the\u00a0Cumbrian coal mine, and a\u00a0new round of licences granted to extract oil and gas from the North Sea, have also raised concerns. The government has\u00a0scrapped its main green recovery measure, the green homes grant, which was intended to create thousands of green jobs by helping households to install insulation, and\u00a0cut incentives to buy electric cars.\\nAhead of Cop26, the UK is calling on all countries to come forward with tougher pledges on carbon in order to meet the Paris targets of limiting global heating to well below 2C, and preferably no more than 1.5C, above pre-industrial levels. The lower limit is increasingly imperilled, as greenhouse gas emissions are forecast to jump sharply this year, by the second highest leap on record, owing to the rebound from the Covid-19 recession and increasing use of coal.\\nDanny Sriskandarajah, the chief executive of Oxfam GB, said: \u201cThe climate crisis is already devastating lives in poorer countries, but the world\u2019s most developed economies are not immune. The UK government has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead the world towards a safer, more liveable planet for all of us.\\n\u201cIt should strain every diplomatic sinew to secure the strongest possible outcome at the G7 and Cop26, and lead by example by turning promises into action and reversing self-defeating decisions like the proposed coalmine in Cumbria and cuts to overseas aid.\u201d\\nThe record of Boris Johnson\u2019s government has come under close scrutiny in the run-up to the G7 and Cop26 meetings. Leading figures in climate diplomacy have said the prime minister must \u201cget a grip\u201d of the UN talks in order to ensure their success, as rows over a proposed new coalmine, the decision to slash overseas aid from 0.7% to 0.5% of GDP, and issues such as new oil and gas licences for the North Sea, the scrapping of the green homes grant and of incentives for electric vehicles, and airport expansion, have all undermined the government\u2019s green credentials.\\nOverseas aid has been the key sticking point for many, described as a diplomatic disaster when the success of Cop26 hinges in part on the UK persuading other rich nations at the G7 summit to come up with far higher pledges of financial assistance to the developing world, to help poor countries cut their emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown.\\nDozens of Conservative rebels are planning to try to force the government to back down on the aid cuts in a key vote on Monday.

In 2017, in Bristol, she created an urban butterfly transect to measure, by weekly survey, changes in the numbers and variety of butterflies in a set area. In addition, she initiated a conference programme looking at urban issues such as verge mowing management and wildlife gardening.\\nMaggie was a member of Ashley Vale Allotment Association.

Treasonous I would call that \u2013 absolute traitor!\u201d\\nMcCormack was made to immediately withdraw this comment, given that treason has a fairly particular definition in Australian law, which pretty much translates to declaring war on Australia, or taking up arms with a nation that has declared war against Australia, or participating in any way in causing the death of the queen, her heir, the governor general or the prime minister. Writing a few letters doesn\u2019t appear to have made the list.\\nSo a quiet week, all things considered.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3563737cd9b0746b4e79723fc81b16c7d627437d/0_15_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "michael mccormack"]], "author": ["Amy Remeikis"], "date": "2021-06-18"}}
