You have appointed yourselves as the sole arbiters of what should be done about climate change, bound neither by the principles of democracy nor the rule of law.', '“And your fanaticism makes you entirely heedless of the rights of your fellow citizens. You have taken it upon yourselves to decide that your fellow citizens must suffer disruption and harm, and how much disruption and harm they must suffer, simply so that you may parade your views.”', 'Although all of the defendants ended the trial representing themselves, three of them – Hallam, Shaw and Whittaker De Abreu – instructed counsel to speak on their behalf in mitigation.', 'Each barrister sought unsuccessfully to persuade the judge that lengthy sentences could be avoided. Francesca Cociani, for Shaw, said the likelihood of his reoffending was lowered by the fact that the new Labour government had essentially met Just Stop Oil’s core demand by ending North Sea oil and gas exploration.', 'Gethin, who offered her own comments in mitigation, said: “I want to remind the court once more that my reasons for taking action were not beliefs or opinions. Earth’s life-support systems are breaking down due to human activities, whether we believe it or not.', '“These are not beliefs or opinions and feeling strongly that this is wrong is greatly understandable, I would argue. I deeply regret that this action was necessary … I maintain that it was necessary and I stand by my actions as the most effective option available to me.”', 'Supporters of the defendants expressed outrage at the sentences, which came after a two-week trial in which the judge denied them any of the defences in law for causing a public nuisance.', 'Hehir ruled that the jury should not take into account evidence about climate breakdown, which the defendants wanted to point to as the key motivation behind their actions, and which they said provided them with a reasonable excuse for them.', 'Michel Forst, the UN’s special rapporteur on environmental defenders, who attended part of the trial, issued a statement at its conclusion.', '“Today is a dark day for peaceful environmental protest” in the UK, he said. “This sentence should shock the conscience of any member of the public. It should also put all of us on high alert on the state of civic rights and freedoms in the United Kingdom.', '“Rulings like today’s set a very dangerous precedent, not just for environmental protest but any form of peaceful protest that may, at one point or another, not align with the interests of the government of the day.”', 'Greenpeace UK’s programme director, Amy Cameron, said: “What sort of country locks people away for years for planning a peaceful demonstration, let alone for talking about it on a Zoom call? We’re giving a free hand to the polluting elite robbing us of a habitable planet while jailing those who’re trying to stop them – it makes no sense.', '“These sentences are not a one-off anomaly but the culmination of years of repressive legislation, overblown government rhetoric and a concerted assault on the right of juries to deliberate according to their conscience. It’s part of the mess the Labour government has inherited from its predecessor and they must fix it by giving back to people the right to protest that’s been slowly being taken away from them.”', 'Separately on Thursday, three airports were granted high court injunctions against fossil fuel and environmental activists protesting at their sites.

A fifth defendant, Roger Hallam, was sentenced to five years by a judge who said he “sat at the very highest level of the conspiracy”.', 'Forst, whose role is to protect individuals facing penalisation, persecution, or harassment for exercising their environmental rights, attended two days of the trial earlier this month as he attempted to intervene with UK authorities on behalf of Shaw. He called the jail terms “punitive and repressive”.', '“We are really shocked by what’s happening in the UK in the case of Daniel Shaw,” Forst told the Guardian on Friday. “He has already spent more than 100 days on remand. Now, to hear that he’s been sentenced to four years in prison, that’s really shocking.', '“Even if we are talking about a disruptive form of protest, and there is no denying that, it is still entirely non-violent and it should have been treated as such. For me, for my team, it’s not acceptable in a democracy like the UK.', '“The second element is that it’s a very dangerous ruling, not only for environmental protesters, but also for the right to protest as such, because we understand now that those who would like to go to the street to demonstrate, to organise a rally, they would consider twice before going out.', '“That’s a deterrent for the right to protest in the UK.”', 'He said he was in discussions to visit the UK in the autumn, and that he hoped to meet the new attorney general, Richard Hermer, to discuss the case “but more broadly what’s happening with the right to protest and democracy in the UK”.', 'A host of human rights campaigners joined Forst in decrying the sentences. Sam Grant, director of advocacy at Liberty, said what appeared to be a trend for increasingly severe sentences for non-violent protest indicated “a grave erosion of … freedoms” in the UK. Hanna Hindstrom, who investigates rights abuses against environmental defenders for Global Witness, said the “incredibly harsh” sentences were “a profound injustice”.', 'And Tom Southerden, Amnesty International UK’s human rights adviser, called on the government to repeal the portions of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 that legislated the statutory offence of public nuisance used against the defendants.', '“Today’s draconian sentences and the manner in which the trial was conducted show that the hardline anti-protest approach adopted by the previous government is being emulated by the courts,” Southerden said.', 'But on Friday, government officials said ministers would not intervene. Pressed on whether Labour would look again at anti-protest laws it opposed before entering government, Starmer’s spokeswoman said: “The prime minister is very clear that when it comes to these cases, the judgments and sentencing is for independent judges to make them, they’ve had all the facts and evidence before them.', 'Sign up to Down to Earth', ""The planet's most important stories.

Fundamentally, [it is] not for politicians to interfere and opine on decisions that have been taken by judges.”', 'The government was nevertheless coming under growing pressure to look again at the controversial laws, which critics said have led to increasingly draconian action against climate activists.', 'Even Doughty Street Chambers, where the prime minister practised as a barrister, pointed out “there was no irony lost” in the fact that public nuisance, when a common law offence, was formerly often used to prosecute polluters, while “the same offence in statutory form is now being zealously deployed to prosecute environmental protesters”.', 'Dale Vince, the green entrepreneur, who stepped away from bankrolling Just Stop Oil to become one of the Labour party’s most significant donors, joined the broadcasters Chris Packham and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall in echoing calls for a meeting with Hermer about the protesters’ case.', '“I think climate denial should be illegal, but instead it’s illegal to talk about the climate crisis in court,” Vince said. “Now five peaceful protesters could face years in jail as a result of this perverse ruling. It’s a travesty of justice and that’s why I’m joining the calls for the new attorney general to intervene.”', 'Clive Lewis, MP for Norwich South, called for action “as a matter of some urgency”, adding: “I will be backing calls for a meeting with the attorney general, I think that needs to happen with some urgency, I will be addressing this in parliament.” He called for the laws “which have allowed this to happen” to be “consigned to the dustbin of history”.', 'Siân Berry, the Green MP, said the sentences were “a hangover from the last government’s obsession with punishing … non-violent, peaceful protests”. They highlighted a challenge for the new government, she added, and Labour must “review the guidelines given to judges that have led to such extreme, disproportionate sentences for peaceful protest”.', 'On Friday, their views appeared to resonate with the public at large.

They sought to turn Hehir’s court into a “site of civil resistance”, causing as much disruption as necessary to ensure that if the jury could not see their evidence on climate breakdown, then the jurors could at least be in no doubt it was being kept from them.', 'By the time the jury retired to consider a verdict, police had been called into court no fewer than seven times, four of the five defendants had been remanded to prison and 11 others were facing contempt of court proceedings for protests outside the courtroom.', 'Roger Hallam, Daniel Shaw, Louise Lancaster, Lucia Whittaker De Abreu and Cressida Gethin were standing trial on charges of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance, accused of being the “queen bees” behind a series of protests on the M25.', 'Under the banner of the climate campaign group Just Stop Oil, already notorious for its road-blocking protests, they were said to have recruited 64 people to climb gantries over London’s orbital motorway, forcing police to stop traffic on four consecutive days.', 'The prosecution said the disruption amounted to £750,000 of economic damage and a £1m policing cost, with about 709,000 drivers affected. The judge warned the defendants they faced a harsh penalty if convicted.', 'Two men who blocked the Queen Elizabeth II bridge the month before the gantry protests were jailed for two years each, sentences Hehir said he would take as a reference point.', 'But why was Forst there in the first place? What can only now be reported is that he had made an extraordinary intervention on the eve of the trial, issuing a public statement criticising the treatment of Shaw in particular. As he awaited trial, Shaw had already spent more than 100 days on remand, been forced to wear an ankle tag, made subject to a strict curfew and banned from meeting his co-defendants or attending environmental demonstrations.', 'Forst’s intervention came amid increasing alarm at tightening restrictions on protest rights. In the past two years, the UK government has passed two wide-ranging laws targeting direct actions by climate activists, creating a host of new offences with potentially stiff penalties. At the same time, with juries having repeatedly acquitted defendants prosecuted for climate and other protests on the basis that their cause was just, the attorney general had applied to the court of appeal to limit the kinds of defences available in such cases.', 'Forst had already written to the UK government to express concern over these developments, but issued his latest statement after getting no response. “I fail to see how exposing Mr Shaw to a multiyear prison sentence for being on a Zoom call that discussed the organisation of a peaceful environmental protest is either reasonable or proportionate, nor pursues a legitimate public purpose,” Forst wrote. “Rather, I am gravely concerned that a sanction of this magnitude is purely punitive and repressive.”', 'That Zoom call was a key piece of evidence for the prosecution case. Made just days before the M25 protests began, the call was, the prosecution said, part of efforts to recruit volunteers to take part in the direct actions. Unbeknown to those taking part, it had been infiltrated by a Sun journalist who recorded it and passed it to the Metropolitan police.', 'On the face of it, the prosecution evidence seemed damning – and was mostly uncontested by the defendants. But it was only after prosecutors completed their case that events in court began to get really interesting.', 'The defendants had wanted to mount a defence of reasonable excuse. They proposed inviting expert witnesses such as the geophysicist Bill McGuire, who has written extensively on the implications of climate breakdown, to explain why the urgency of the unfolding environmental crisis warranted their actions. Such defence strategies have worked in some previous cases, with defendants acquitted in the face of apparently conclusive evidence.', 'But Hehir ruled that the defendants in this case could not present any evidence about the climate to the court, save for the brief statements about their philosophical and political beliefs that ultimately would have no bearing on the verdict.', 'It was in this context that, as the second week of the trial began, protesters began appearing each morning outside the court, displaying placards saying: “Jurors deserve to hear the whole truth.”', 'Of the defendants, only Hallam disputed the role the prosecution claimed he played in the conspiracy. He told the court he had merely been asked to “give the case for civil disobedience”.', '“I wish to say on oath that I was not involved in this campaign,” he said. However, he went on to argue that even if the jury determined he had played a role in the conspiracy, they should find him and his co-defendants not guilty on the basis they had a reasonable excuse or justification for the actions they took.', 'In a three-hour address, punctuated by interruptions from an irritated Hehir, Hallam lectured the jury on his interpretation of the law, and why, he claimed, it showed the activists had an excuse for blocking the M25 to raise the alarm about climate breakdown.', 'Hehir told jurors Hallam’s legal analysis was peppered with mistakes. He repeatedly sent the jury out to admonish Hallam for referencing climate science he had ruled irrelevant to the case. But the judge proved more patient than the defendant seemed to expect. In the end, Hallam told jurors: “I apologise to you if I’m a little bit incoherent, I didn’t actually expect that I was going to get this far.”', 'He did not get much further. The following morning, the judge brought Hallam’s evidence to an end and, after the defendant refused to answer a cross-examination and then refused to leave the witness box, insisting he was not finished, Hehir called police into the court and had him arrested for contempt.', '“Democracy in action, guys! Democracy in action,” Hallam said to watching reporters, as he was dragged into the dock, then down to the cells.', 'It was the first of many such scenes. Later that same day, Shaw was arrested and taken to the cells in almost identical circumstances, and Hehir sent jurors – who had not witnessed the arrests – home early. “I have never had to order a defendant to be arrested in a courtroom before and I’m very sad to have had to do that not once, but twice today,” the judge said.', 'On the face of it, Hallam and Shaw’s theatrics looked self-defeating. But the defendants believed they contributed to a victory. The following morning, on agreement, four “facts not in dispute” relating to the climate crisis were read into the court record by Fiona Robertson, second barrister for the crown. They were: that the climate crisis was “an existential threat to humanity”; that global heating above 1.5C would have catastrophic consequences; that in the past 12 months average global temperatures were 1.6C above the pre-industrial baseline; and that in October 2022 the government had opened a new round of oil and gas licensing.', 'It was a development the defendants and their supporters said amounted to the prosecution conceding the climate crisis was “an existential threat to humanity” – and one that they were to refer to throughout the remaining days of the trial.', 'Forst was in court to see this. He also witnessed much else. Hallam, bailed the previous day, was dragged out of court again after he began speaking straight to jurors during Lancaster’s evidence. Shortly after, Shaw directly challenged the judge, asking: “Why are you not trying the people causing this crisis?” He too was dragged out. Lancaster was next, for refusing to leave the witness box, and that night, all three were remanded to prison. Gethin had to wait but was also arrested for contempt on both Monday and Tuesday.', 'By the end of the trial, Whittaker De Abreu, the only one who had not represented herself, was the only defendant left in court.', 'As a punishment for their “persistent disruption”, Hehir slashed the time given to each defendant from one hour to 20 minutes. He further prohibited any mention of the climate crisis, the legal defences he had disallowed or the principle of jury equity – the idea that jurors can acquit based on their conscience.', 'As Hallam, Shaw, Lancaster and Gethin gave their speeches from behind the reinforced glass screen of the dock, they each proceeded to flout Hehir’s prohibitions, arguing they had been denied a right to a fair trial.', 'Hallam told jurors: “It’s blindingly obvious to us here first that you have not been given all the evidence you need. You cannot be sure of our guilt if you are not sure that you have not been given the evidence … we have received no good reason why we are not allowed to tell you what is blindingly obvious, namely what I’m not allowed to speak about. If you are not allowed to hear the blindingly obvious then it’s not a fair trial is it?”', 'It took just a day’s deliberations for the jury to unanimously find them guilty.', 'Given the recent history of UK climate protest trials, in which defendants have been sentenced to jail for merely mentioning the words “climate change”, and notwithstanding the dramatic arrests in court, Forst said he was surprised the judge gave them an opportunity to mention climate breakdown at all.', '“But the little latitude they had to mention climate change was in the meantime emptied of its very meaning by the fact that, overall, the jury was told to ignore most of it,” he added.', 'Forst also said he was dismayed by the judge’s decision to refuse the defendants a chance to present more fully their evidence about climate breakdown. “That’s precisely one of the serious concerns I have about what is happening in some courts in the UK. Defendants should be allowed to explain why they have decided to use non-conventional but yet peaceful forms of action, like civil disobedience, when they engage in environmental protest,” he said.', 'It is not just in the UK that climate defenders are facing persecution, according to Forst, but the problems in this country are particularly acute. Protesters in countries such as France and Germany also faced political opposition – and in some cases, police brutality – but when it came to judicial persecution, the UK was unique, he said.', '“[Elsewhere] you see environmental activists who block roads or sporting events being sentenced to a fine, or even sometimes suspended prison sentences for instance,” Forst said. “However, while I don’t have a full picture of what’s happening in every country, the UK is a nightmare for climate activists from this point of view, in the sense that the sentences imposed in other countries are neither that harsh, nor that widespread.', '“Facing several years of imprisonment for taking part in a Zoom call – this is something I have not seen anywhere else and it is shockingly disproportionate.”', 'The nightmare is just beginning for Hallam, Shaw, Lancaster, Gethin and Whittaker De Abreu, who have all been remanded to prison before sentencing next Thursday.

The courts have been clear that leniency is conditional: “A\xa0sense of proportion on the part of the offenders in avoiding excessive damage or inconvenience is matched by a relatively benign approach to sentencing.” The judge argued that their conspiracy to cause extreme disruption, and the risk of harm including to the emergency services, excluded them from consideration for reduced culpability or lower sentencing. He also pointed to other aggravating factors including the fact all were on bail for other charges when they committed the offence. (All have previous convictions.)', 'Because he regarded their offence as more serious, the judge was consciously harsher than in a previous case of two protesters who closed the Dartford crossing for 40 hours]; their prison sentences were discounted by 25% (to three years and two years seven months) because of their motive (which the court of appeal described as “arguably generous”). Perhaps overly punitive, but it is hard to disagree that the right to protest is qualified. In this case, the protesters were by design setting out to cause their fellow citizens the maximum disruption possible. The\xa0police say Just Stop Oil has refused to work constructively with them in the context of offers to facilitate lawful protest. Treating them with excessive lenience would\xa0send a message that anyone who feels strongly about an issue – from Scottish independence to banning abortion – should feel free to shut down the motorway network to make their point. Moreover, Hallam has himself in the past implied getting jailed is an objective:\xa0“If you’re not in prison, you’re not in resistance.”', 'Sign up to Observed', ""Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers"", 'after newsletter promotion', 'Next is the question of whether the sentences were too harsh, setting aside motivations. As well as the impact and intended impact, the judge relied heavily on the need for deterrence; he described them all as having crossed the line from “concerned campaigner to fanatic”; they had “appointed [themselves] as the sole arbiters about what should be done about climate change, bound neither by democracy nor the rule of law”. He pointed to their behaviour at the trial, calculated to disrupt the proceedings as much as possible, as evidence of their reoffending risk.', 'Many have fairly questioned whether the prison sentences should have been so long in the context of the wider system; someone taking part in violent disorder that caused serious harm would be sentenced to two to four years under sentencing guidelines, for example. The judge said if their plans had had the intended impact, their sentences would have been closer to the maximum of 10 years, which would put them on a par with the most serious, large-scale fraud cases. Unlike for most other offences, there are no sentencing guidelines for causing public nuisance, a common law offence before it became statutory in 2022, so judges have little guidance; sentences have become tougher since 2022, but so has the scale of organised disruption by groups like\xa0Just Stop Oil.', 'So at the very least there needs to be a review of sentencing in this area to check its proportionality. I\xa0would go further: these protesters committed a serious offence that justifies punishment, but does this have to mean prison? Prison is an expensive, finite resource that should be reserved for criminals who pose a serious risk to the community that cannot be otherwise mitigated; our prisons are overfull to the point they cannot fulfil their rehabilitation role and so are putting society at greater risk. Why not deprive non-violent offenders of their liberty through restrictive curfews monitored through electronic tagging instead?', 'But we should be clear that asking\xa0this question is quite distinct from the overwrought handwringing\xa0which posits that stopping people from self-indulgently crippling important national infrastructure is somehow an authoritarian abuse of democracy.', 'Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist', 'Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

When governments ban them. The oppressive laws introduced by the previous government – the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 and the Public Order Act 2023 – are a tick list of effective political engagement. Everything from locking on and digging tunnels to actions on roads, at airports, oil refineries or newspapers, even marching down a street, has been criminalised. Why? Because these methods work. If they didn’t, the government wouldn’t have bothered.', 'The Conservatives justified their draconian measures with the claim that they prevented “disruption to the public”. But had they cared about disruption, they would have done all they could to prevent climate breakdown. Nothing is more disruptive than the flickering and eventual collapse of Earth systems. If you believe a few people sitting in the street is a major impediment to traffic, take a look at what a sea surge, a flash flood, a windstorm or a rail-buckling, road-melting, bridge-jamming heat event can do to transport infrastructure.', 'The government and prosecutors made great play of the inconvenience caused by the closure of the Dartford Crossing when protesters climbed on to it in 2022. The court imposed massive and cruel penalties. But the crossing is frequently closed by high winds, a problem expected to become much worse as a result of the issue the protesters were seeking to highlight. No government minister appears before the cameras at such moments, thundering about the diversion of ambulances, commuters and parents on the school run, and demanding that the chief executives of oil companies are locked up.', 'Instead, the previous government went out of its way to exacerbate disruption, licensing new oil and gas drilling and an entirely pointless coalmine; blocking onshore wind power; subsidising at great expense people’s fossil fuel bills, rather than spending a fraction of that money to help us insulate and improve our homes.', 'As we approach the Earth systems horizon, governments and corporations have gone to ever more extreme lengths to prevent us from doing anything about it. The Tory government sought to bypass the House of Commons to insert extra measures into the first oppressive bill. When that failed, it inserted them into the second bill. It then used “Henry VIII powers” to extend the measures without proper parliamentary scrutiny. Corporations and public bodies have slapped injunctions on hundreds of people to prevent them from protesting, in some cases forcing them to pay huge amounts of money for the privilege. This outrageous system of private fines for thoughtcrimes has not received nearly enough coverage. Far from preventing such abuses, the previous government reinforced them with new injunction powers of its own: you can now be punished twice for the same political crime.', 'But perhaps the most pernicious innovation was to shut down crucial legal defences. One attorney general removed the defence of proportionality; another removed the defence of lawful excuse. This means that environmental activists can no longer explain their motives to a jury. They have to be tried as though they were mindless vandals, inconveniencing people for kicks, rather than seeking to prevent, at great cost to themselves, the greatest crisis humankind has ever faced. Some protesters have sought to explain themselves regardless, and have as a result been imprisoned for contempt of court.', 'On Thursday five Just Stop Oil activists were sentenced to record prison terms for peaceful protest in the UK. Four of them received four years and one received five years for “conspiracy to cause a public nuisance”: they had been involved in planning to close the M25. These are sentences of the kind you might expect in Russia or Egypt. Before they were handed down, the UN’s special rapporteur Michel Forst pointed out that the terms of the prosecution, in one defendant’s case merely for appearing on a Zoom call, were “shockingly disproportionate”.', 'Four of the defendants were rearrested in court for continuing to explain their motives after the judge had instructed them to stop. He told the jury that the issue of climate breakdown was “entirely irrelevant to the question of whether or not each is guilty or not guilty”. Let’s pretend our existential predicament had no bearing on their actions.', 'Outside the court, 11 more people were arrested for holding signs stating that jurors have a right to exercise their conscience, an ancient principle in English law. Earlier this year, the Tory solicitor-general, a government minister, applied to have another activist, Trudi Warner, prosecuted for holding such a sign. But the application was dismissed on the grounds that she had committed no crime.', 'The new government now seeks to address one grim Tory legacy, our bursting prisons, by releasing prisoners – including violent offenders – early. At the same time it fails to address or even mention another and even worse inheritance: the jailing of entirely peaceful people seeking to prevent existential disaster. Perhaps the prisons can be emptied of violent criminals so they can be refilled with environmentalists.', 'And yet the Labour party committed, before the election, to Just Stop Oil’s core demand: an end to new gas and oil exploitation. There was once a solid political consensus around “maximising economic recovery” of the UK’s oil and gas. I believe Just Stop Oil played a crucial role in changing this.', 'Before the election, Ed Miliband, now the secretary of state for energy security and net zero, recited the usual mantras: Just Stop Oil’s tactics were “alienating people” and not helping its cause. But were it not for the alienating protest movements of the past 20 years, I doubt his job would exist.', 'Labour once recognised that protest is the wellspring of democracy, from which has flowed all our fundamental rights: the right of women to own their lives and make their own decisions, the right to vote, to choose any religion or none, to express our sexuality as we please, to speak freely, to fair wages and working conditions, even to weekends.', 'Effective protest is an ecosystem. It needs a moderate flank and a radical flank. It needs a wide range of skillsets and degrees of commitment.

Here the Guardian explains the basis of the restrictions and why they are so contentious.', 'The judge, Christopher Hehir, placed limits on evidence the defendants could bring on the impacts of climate breakdown, and why such evidence justified the types of acts of which they were accused. His ruling has similarities to that made by Judge Silas Reid in a series of climate protest cases heard at inner London crown court last year in which Reid said climate change could not be mentioned, although in the M25 case Hehir said the defendants could speak about their political or philosophical beliefs on the issue, to give some context to their actions.', 'Judges restrict both sides in court to evidence deemed relevant to the case. In many criminal cases, what is relevant is uncontroversial, but in protest cases it has become a source of fierce debate. Judges have some discretion in deciding what is relevant and look to the existing law. In recent years the defences available to protesters in criminal cases have been reduced, leading some judges to not only disallow those defences but also limit mention of the defendants’ motivations.', 'While no judge will allow anyone giving evidence carte blanche in terms of what they can say and how long they can say it for – which would be a recipe for anarchy – Reid took the most extreme approach. Other judges have adopted more of a compromise, by, for example, restricting the amount of time a defendant can spend talking about their motivation.', 'Climate protesters believe that by preventing them explaining their motivations in full – namely, the existential threat to the planet – judges are preventing jurors from being given the full picture and from making an informed decision on whether to convict or acquit. The campaign group Defend Our Juries says: “Judges in UK courtrooms are denying both defendants and jurors their rights by restricting what defendants can say in their trials and by limiting what jurors are allowed to hear.”', 'Climate protesters have previously been jailed for contempt of court for mentioning the climate crisis as motivation for their actions when expressly forbidden to do so by the judge. At least three of the defendants in the M25 case have been arrested on suspicion of contempt of court.', 'Contempt of court, which has existed since at least the 13th century in England, is intended to protect the right to a fair trial and prevent a case being unfairly influenced. While climate protesters explaining their motivations may feel they are tipping the scales in favour of a fair trial, how a fair trial is achieved and what defences and evidence are relevant and admissible is ultimately for the judge to decide. Disobeying their ruling risks contempt, even if it is inarguable scientific evidence on the climate crisis.', 'Eleven people were arrested for holding placards with messages including “Jurors deserve to hear the whole truth” – an apparent reference to the restrictions placed on defendants – and “Jurors have an absolute right to acquit a defendant according to their conscience”.

The protesters were bailed on condition they did not come within the vicinity of Southwark crown court until a contempt proceedings hearing on 27 September.', 'The law on contempt of court seeks to ensure that jurors decide cases solely on the evidence presented at trial, as controlled by the judge, and to that end nothing on the merits of either side’s case beyond what is heard in court must be published or communicated to them. Members of the jury must be free to carry out their duties without interference or outside influence.', 'The arrest of the 11 people outside the M25 trial follows that of Trudi Warner, who, in March last year, on the first day of a trial of members of Insulate Britain, stood outside inner London crown court holding a placard that read: “Jurors, you have an absolute right to acquit a defendant according to your conscience.” This is a principle enshrined on a plaque in the Old Bailey, but which counsel cannot invite a jury to apply nor inform them of.', 'The solicitor general attempted to bring contempt proceedings against Warner, but Mr Justice Saini refused, sitting at the high court, and dismissed the claim, accusing government lawyers of “mischaracterising” the evidence when they said Warner had acted in an intimidating and abusive manner.

You’ve got to see it through.’ It’s like Olympic training. You go through tough times and being in that cell, and out in the media, is the other half of my work. Thousands of people undertake non-violent direct action and are arrested. These forms of protest are a desperate form of communication to shine a light on the issues, so explaining what and why we’re doing it is important. But\xa0it’s frightening because sometimes you’re dealing with hostile people. I don’t seek out hostility. I find it challenging, as is being in a prison cell.”', 'Stott, who became an Olympic champion when he and Tim Baillie won the C2 canoe slalom 12 years ago, is an impressively calm yet resolute advocate for non-violent direct action to save the planet. He has been arrested 10 times but has not received any kind of custodial sentence, rather some small fines, for his activism.', 'We talk before, during and after he spends much of the day at the Restore Nature Now march, which drew about 80,000 people to central London in late June. Rather than being provocative, Stott is friendly and thoughtful while offering illuminating insights into the way the “dark energy” of elite sport bolsters his resilience. When I ask him about the state of our burning and flooded world, Stott resorts to a\xa0simple football analogy.', '“We’re 10-0 down with five minutes to go,” Stott says. “We’ve got no time left. Positive changes are happening but everything we do now can only minimise the harm. That is really worth fighting for. The harder question is: ‘Am I going to pretend this isn’t happening? Am I going to turn away?’”', 'Stott is on a roll. “To embark on any epic mission, you have to have some naivety because if you knew how hard and brutal it was going to be, you’d never start. But then, if you knew how amazing it would also end up being, you’d be off like a shot. This is the power of sport and what we are doing now. We set ourselves these beautiful visions and that gives you the energy to\xa0start.', '“I see many parallels between sport and the struggles that we’re facing now. The proportion of victory in activism and sport is similar. You don’t win very often but you take satisfaction in a job well done and satisfaction from the small wins. You don’t get the chance to race in, and win, a big race every\xa0day.”', 'Stott is one of those rare people who knows what it is like to win an Olympic gold medal. Yet his path to glory was pitted with doubt. He and Baillie were not selected for the 2008 Olympics and he remembers: “We were good enough technically and physically to win a medal at world level but psychologically we crumbled. Competing was too stressful. We had to face the painful reality we needed to go to those darker places we had avoided.”', 'Their confident rivals, David Florence and Richard Hounslow, were a more typical alpha-male pairing expected to be the best British canoeing hope at London 2012. “They came along just after our 2008 failure,” Stott says. “We realised we had to work on our mental toughness and competing against them exposed us to adversity. It’s uncomfortable because you spend a lot of time getting beaten. They had different values and methods but we shared the same coach – and every day was a challenge.”', 'Stott laughs. “I went bald because of those guys.”', 'They also faced the Hochschorner twins, Pavol and Peter, the Slovakian pair who were favoured to win their fourth consecutive Olympic title. “They were the best and everyone thought they’d win,” Stott says. “They were our heroes but we focused on doing our best while being at peace with the idea that we would accept it if we weren’t good enough. That was liberating.”', 'As the slowest qualifiers, Baillie and Stott were the first to race against the clock in the final. “We weren’t the best on paper but our mindset was strong,” Stott says. “When we crossed the line our coach was jumping up and down and he\xa0said: ‘You’re two and a half seconds faster than the semi‑final\xa0leaders.’”', 'By the time those quickest qualifiers, Florence and Hounslow, were set to race, Stott and Baillie were guaranteed silver. That soon turned into gold and Stott smiles: “I remember standing on the podium, a really hot sun on the side of my face, hearing the national anthem. My hairs are standing up now talking about it because we had worked super‑hard and gone\xa0through all the ups and\xa0downs.\xa0It was rare beyond words to be at your peak and win your home Olympics. But I also felt that time was preparation for\xa0whatever came next.”', 'Baillie retired and Stott and his new crewmate, Mark Proctor, missed qualifying for the 2016 Rio Olympics. Stott became a vegetarian the next day and, having been on his first march in 2008, he soon turned to activism. “Towards the end I’d found it more and more difficult,” he says of his sporting career. “We’d raced in Rio, with the canoe course in the middle of the favela, and the heat was extreme. I felt my body melting inside. It was really horrible. We’d trained in Dubai where there is a facade of freedom but it’s very restricted and repressed. Training on a river in the middle of the desert made it stranger and more difficult.”', 'Stott and his friend Dave Hampton, a former GB rower, started their Champions For Earth movement, which brings sport and environmental concerns together. “That was in 2017,” Stott recalls, “and in late 2018 Extinction Rebellion burst into my world. It offered a formula to reference the science on the one hand, and history and social change on the other. So I was like: ‘This sounds sensible and I should be involved as a minor public figure.’ Any power I have is not for selling Rice Krispies. It’s to do something good for people.', '“Extinction Rebellion has always referenced Gandhi, Martin Luther King and other non-violent protests. I’m not a violent person but I like the way that sport channels the dark energy within us all in a positive way. Huge strides are being made because of Extinction Rebellion, Greta Thunberg and the non-violent methods we have used. Just Stop Oil are now charging ahead but it’s incredibly difficult. It took a lot of bravery for me to do what I did but it’s the least I can do when I see this\xa0challenge.”', 'Sign up to The Recap', 'The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action', 'after newsletter promotion', 'Stott recalls the series of protests Extinction Rebellion staged in 2019 to cause disruption as a way of highlighting the need to tackle the climate and nature emergency. “The first step was the Five Bridges action, which was to test their method of closing London down. I was arrested for the first time. But it was April 2019 when we had our big popping moment and that’s when I first ‘went public’ and got arrested as an Olympic champion.”', 'Apart from lying in the road to stop traffic, Stott and his partner, Laura Baldwin, a former Olympic sailor, were among a group of XR activists that blockaded Fawley refinery in Hampshire. Stott also glued himself to another protester on top of a Shell oil tanker in Bayswater Road, near Hyde Park, in April 2022. He and four others were cleared of any wrongdoing in court.', 'While Stott argues that some judges have a vendetta against environmental activists he has, mostly, received fair treatment from the police and the courts. “I’ve only been treated roughly by the police on one occasion and that was during a protest against Amazon, a horrendous company,” he says.', '“I was acting as a liaison between the protesters and the police to make it a more controlled environment because nobody likes it when panic or agitation bubbles over. Normally the police don’t arrest the protest liaison. But in this case they grabbed me by the neck and dragged me to the van. A few hours later, in the queue into the custody suite to get booked in, I spoke to the policeman who did it. He said: ‘I feel really bad as you’re a nice guy and I wish I wasn’t having to do this.’ I was like: ‘I wish you didn’t either because we could have carried on peacefully.’”', 'Stott acknowledges that changes to the law have made protest much riskier. “Now, sitting in the road, or wilful obstruction of the highway – which I was convicted of once – means you can be sent to prison for a year,” he says.', 'How does this make him feel? Stott, now 45, pauses. “It’s worrying. I have a partner and Laura has a young son and I’m involved in family life. But, if necessary, I am prepared to go to prison. This is a sensible and responsible struggle in a great emergency. With\xa0that\xa0athlete’s mindset, if prison is required, then maybe it\xa0has\xa0to\xa0be\xa0me.”', 'Stott has little hope that sufficient action will be taken, in regard to environmental issues, under the new Labour government. He also warns: “In the future, young people may feel non-violent action is not enough. They may become violent in their frustration that so little is being done. Their anger may bubble\xa0over.”', 'We catch the tube from Waterloo to Green Park and Stott reiterates that he will never fly again – even though Baillie, his close friend, and\xa0three children live in Canada. They remain in touch and Stott thinks a lot of the Baillie kids, and Laura’s son, whenever he is locked up in a\xa0cell.', 'Before the Restore Nature Now march Stott is embraced and high-fived by friends and colleagues. He soon begins his role as an amiable and efficient MC and reminds everyone that 400 organisations are represented and the march will be peaceful. As Stott tells me a week later: “It was a great success. We had many first-time marchers and it was one of the most media-covered marches ever. But I don’t know how many people believe they put any pressure on the government to change its approach. I would still argue that non-violent direct action is an effective way of pushing something invisible into the light.”', 'As for our uncertain future, Stott says: “I don’t know whether we’re going to win. But I do my best. The most powerful thing I took from my sporting career is belief in human potential and, to me, it’s a force. Nobody knows what a human being\xa0is capable of until that moment they become truly committed. Amazing things can happen then. I choose to believe that a great turning, and a great collective change, is\xa0still\xa0possible.”']",['Donald McRae'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7d2b084412f8e30c93578d3b0726fa65ed311fb/349_500_7857_4714/master/7857.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', ""Etienne Stott with a 'Champions For Earth' flag""], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e44d42efa697ec449d070ab1c4f8041c858c196/547_947_7592_4555/master/7592.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Etienne Stott addresses the Restore Nature Now march in June 2024'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75fbe203bc378ecf23a1a8c4f0ee374a518010e3/0_27_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Etienne Stott with Tim Baillie compete on their way to Olympic gold at London 2012'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b407443c57cf6e759fbd24b1d9bdf0c438a9f165/61_0_1798_1080/master/1798.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Screengrab from a video of Olympic gold medallist Etienne Stott being arrested by police at the Extinction Rebellion demonstration on Waterloo Bridge']]",

We need a better plan', 'The Labour party has a plan for returning to power: it will get BlackRock to rebuild Britain. Its reasoning is straightforward. A cash-strapped government that wants to avoid tax increases or austerity has no choice but to partner with big finance, attracting private investment to rebuild the infrastructure that is crumbling after years of Tory underinvestment. Labour has already done the arithmetic: to mobilise £3 of private capital from institutional investors, you need to offer them £1 in public subsidies. But every time you hear Labour announce such an infrastructure partnership, think of the hidden politics. BlackRock will privatise Britain – our housing, education, health, nature and green energy – with our taxpayer money as sweetener.', 'BlackRock has long peddled the idea of public-private partnerships for infrastructure, climate and development. Yet its political momentum has recently accelerated. When its chair, Larry Fink, the world’s most powerful financier, sat with world leaders at the G7 summit last month, he promised the following: rich countries need growth, infrastructure investment can deliver that growth, but public debt is too high for the state alone to invest the estimated $75tn (£59tn) necessary by 2040. Trillions, however, are available to asset managers who look after our pensions and insurance contributions (BlackRock, the largest of these firms, manages about $10tn, as a shrinking welfare state pushes us – future pensioners – into its arms).', 'If governments work with big finance, Fink explained, they can unlock these trillions. But to do so, they will need to mint public infrastructure into investable assets that can generate steady returns for investors. Why does BlackRock need the state? Why can’t it deploy trillions without the government’s helping hand? The British public remembers all too well PFIs, the private finance initiatives through which the state ended up paying extortionate amounts to private contractors that designed, built, financed or operated public services such as prisons, schools and hospitals before handing them back to the state, often in poor condition.', 'But for big finance, there is more now at stake. In this golden age of infrastructure, financiers plan to own our infrastructure outright and transform it into a source of steady revenue. Since buying Global Infrastructure Partners in January 2024, BlackRock holds about $150bn in infrastructure assets, including US renewable energy companies, wastewater services in France and airports in England and Australia. It plans to expand aggressively, just like other private infrastructure funds. Direct ownership is the main game, but not the only one. Big finance can also invest in infrastructure indirectly, by lending to private infrastructure companies. The key is returns. For this, BlackRock wants the state to “derisk” investments. This financial jargon was included in the 2024 Labour manifesto, and it in essence involves the state stepping in to improve the returns on infrastructure assets.', 'The choice here is not merely between public and private financing of public goods, but whether British citizens should tolerate the government handing out public subsidies for privatised infrastructure. Housing is only one example of the areas where these investors can already be glimpsed. Institutional landlords – the most prominent being Blackstone, a private equity fund that is one of the world’s biggest corporate residential landlords – can acquire residential housing by participating in the privatisation of public housing. After the global financial crisis, the firm also bought up nonperforming mortgages, and since then it has gone on a global shopping spree, snapping up homes across the US and Europe. In the past year, Blackstone bought new rental homes in Britain worth about £1.4bn from the housebuilding company Vistry.', 'Look behind Blackstone’s returns – which come from rents and rising house prices – and you will find the state’s footprint. The government has helped to guarantee and derisk these returns through regulations that favour asset owners over renters, through economic policies that support house price inflation and through the provision of income support – such as housing benefit – that allows renters to continue paying their institutional landlords. Although we’re told that partnering with these investors is a means of solving the housing crisis, it often delivers the opposite: higher rents, the displacement of lower-income tenants who are often from minority groups, and less affordable housing. This explains the backlash against institutional landlords, from Copenhagen to Berlin, Dublin and Madrid. Yet such public pressure will only be effective once the state returns to building public housing.', 'Labour’s strategy raises a bigger set of questions about the type of state we want. Starmer’s vision for government-by-BlackRock reduces the question of state capacity to “how do I get BlackRock to invest in infrastructure assets?” This model involves the state in effect subsidising the privatisation of everyday life. This doesn’t only make it harder to bring public goods back into public ownership; it also allows big finance to tighten the grip on the social contract with citizens, and to become the ultimate arbiter of climate, energy and welfare politics, which will have profound distributional, structural and political consequences.', 'Already, BlackRock is betting on becoming a key provider of green energy infrastructure – though its actual commitment to tackling the climate crisis only extends so far. The firm has lobbied heavily against European proposals to regulate its lending to fossil fuel interests with penalties, and has instead called for voluntary climate commitments. It is aiming to rapidly grow its green energy profits by tapping the government subsidies that will probably be provided through Starmer’s GB Energy, and through the US Inflation Reduction Act.', 'But the profits BlackRock will hope to generate through investing in green energy are likely to come at a huge cost. In Britain, we know that the public ownership of green energy is more effective at lowering consumer bills, accelerating the green transition and creating good jobs. The risk is not only that our climate future will be vastly more expensive if actors such as BlackRock are driving it, but that this future will also produce a more unequal society, where citizens equate green measures with unaffordable public services. This may well provide the kindling for authoritarian, far-right fossil-fuel politics that reject the green transition and frame it as an assault on people’s living standards.', 'Instead, we should plan creatively for a future where extreme climate events necessitate permanent state intervention, from price controls to buffer stocks and public ownership. What’s needed is a big green state. For this, we first need to repair a serious failure of macroeconomic policy imagination that regards the public purse as too small to fund transformative public infrastructure. To do so will require a radical transformation of the state. The state that Rachel Reeves, the likely future chancellor, promises us must break down the neoliberal walls between monetary, fiscal and industrial policy, and scrap low-tax regimes for multinational corporations and individuals with high net worths. It must shrink the power of big finance. This would be a gigantic undertaking, but it is the only realistic one we have.', 'Daniela Gabor is professor of economics and macrofinance at UWE Bristol', 'Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But now they are looking into an abyss.', '“Most of my friends went into the North Sea industry because for them, and for their fathers and their grandfathers, it has always been seen as a sure thing. Does the green economy offer that same security, the same pay?” Douglas says.', 'This is a crucial moment for these communities, according to Joe Rollin, a senior organiser at the union Unite, which represents tens of thousands of oil and gas workers. “We simply can’t let these workers be the coalminers of this generation, with all the devastation to lives and communities that would entail,” he says.', 'This is the challenge facing politicians in Westminster and Holyrood before this week’s general election. How do they manage the inevitable and urgent decline of North Sea oil and gas – and can they ensure a just transition to new low-carbon jobs that are fully unionised, well-paid and secure?', 'For Mika Minio-Paluello, a policy officer at the Trades Union Congress (TUC), there is a lot on the line.', '“Whatever happens to the people working in North Sea oil and gas, it is being closely watched by those in different industries and sectors – not just across the UK but also in other countries – to see if we can take working people on this journey.', '“It is a test case in some ways, for the whole idea of a just transition, of what happens when we decarbonise … we simply can’t have a repeat of what happened to coal workers in the 80s.”', 'The spectre of the miners’ plight after the pit closures in the 1980s hangs over this debate. The communities that were decimated when the then Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher closed the pits and smashed the coalminers’ union never recovered.', 'Arguably the stakes now are even higher. The escalating climate crisis demands a rapid end to fossil fuel production, but the populist right across Europe is on the rise and it has climate action in their sights – describing it as a remote, elite project being done at the expense of ordinary workers.', 'The UK’s main political parties are divided on the issue. The Conservative party is still promising to “max out” oil and gas in the North Sea by granting licences for new exploration every year. Meanwhile, Labour has promised to put an end to new licences, and raise taxes on the large profits being made by companies operating in the North Sea. The party is also promising “not a single job” will be lost during the transition.', 'In response, the Scottish National party has U-turned on its pledge to phase out fossil fuel licences and is trying to tread a “middle ground”, saying it will approve licences if they meet strict climate conditions – although most experts struggle to see how this could be possible.', 'Nigel Farage, the leader of the insurgent populist Reform UK party, is waiting to capitalise, vowing at his manifesto launch last month to axe net zero policies and fast-track licences to open up the North Sea.', '“If we fail to do this transition in a way that takes communities with us, then we leave the way open for Farage and the far right,” said Minio-Paluello. “The risk of the far right culture wars building a wave of support on the back of our failure is very, very real.”', 'There is little doubt the writing is on the wall for the industry. Experts point out that the number of jobs supported directly and indirectly by oil and gas has more than halved in the past decade – from 441,000 to 214,00 – during which time the government has issued roughly 400 new licences in six licensing rounds.', 'According to the former head of the oil and gas regulator, new licences would make a difference to gas production only “around the edges”.

According to a report by the consultancy EY, which was commissioned by the Scottish government, North Sea workers have an annual average salary of £88,000, while those working in the oil and gas supply chain earn an average of £51,000 a year.

First, the General Medical Council has disgraced itself by its judgment to suspend the GP, Sarah Benn, after she took part in a perfectly peaceful Just Stop Oil protest; so the GMC is the last institution to be supervising anybody. Second, PAs are the Tory administration’s attempt to provide medical care on the cheap; but of course in medicine, as in other walks of life,cutting standards and corners is never cheap. As there won’t be enough consultants to supervise the influx of PAs, the legal profession will be rubbing its hands in glee.', 'A better solution is to get rid of GPs entirely; get nurse practitioners to run what used to be GP surgeries; and promote GPs to the role of “physician associates” so that the entire workforce can start practising proper medicine again within the secondary referral setting.Dr Robin Russell-Jones\n Marlow, Buckinghamshire', 'It’s surprising how Simon Tisdall can talk about the need for constitutional reform (to solve America’s “Trump” problem) without discussing neoliberal economic reform (“America’s big problem is not Biden, it’s the menace to democracy posed by Trump”).', 'The\xa0radical Tea Party was formed as\xa0a response to the 1989 US/Canada Free Trade Agreement, which, within a decade of its unpopular imposition, threw millions of middle-class Americans and Canadians in the heartland out\xa0of work.', 'It is the same neoliberal economic policy at work in Britain, France, Italy, Spain and Germany. Most of these nations are also lurching to the right, as more and more people become frustrated with their impoverished economic realities.

The racing public still adored him and thousands turned up to see him run without having backed him. From the undefeated Eclipse in the 18th century (“Eclipse first, the rest nowhere”) to Nijinsky, Brigadier Gerard, Dancing Brave, Red Rum, Arkle and Desert Orchid, people do love brilliant racehorses. Last year, I forked out £90 (plus travel expenses) to see Frankel at his Newmarket stud. It was worth every\xa0penny to be in the presence of a superstar. I am a football fan but I wouldn’t pay £90 to meet any retired – or current – players, no matter how famous.Jim Hatley\n Brighton', 'While Will Hutton is quite right that there is capital available in existing pension funds to aid growth, there is another source staring us in the face (“Labour needs billions to fund its plans – and I know where it can be found”).

What does it mean for the race?', 'Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition', 'We’re resending today’s newsletter because some subscribers received it with the wrong subject line. Apologies for the error.', 'Good morning. Last night, the Republican national convention came to a fervent climax: after days of accolades from Donald Trump’s supporters in the aftermath of the attempt on his life at the weekend, the headline act finally stepped forward to give them his blessing. Accepting the party’s nomination, Trump spoke for more than an hour and a half – and while he began on a note of unity with heavily religious overtones, he soon turned to the more divisive rhetoric that has been familiar for years.', 'If claims of a more statesmanlike approach from Trump were overrated, the adoring reception from delegates was also an indication of how pumped up Republicans are – and what a formidable task faces Joe Biden, or his possible Democratic replacement. Today’s newsletter, with the Guardian’s David Smith in Milwaukee, runs you through the speech and the convention, and what it all means in the race for the presidency. Here are the headlines.', 'Protest | Five Just Stop Oil activists who planned to block the M25 have been sentenced to lengthy jail terms by a judge who told them they had “crossed the line from concerned campaigner to fanatic”. Supporters of the defendants expressed outrage at the four and five-year sentences, the longest ever given in the UK for non-violent protest.', 'Covid-19 | The UK’s pandemic planning was beset by “fatal strategic flaws”, a damning first report from the UK Covid-19 public inquiry has found, putting pressure on the prime minister to overhaul the national civil emergencies system. Former health secretaries Jeremy Hunt and Matt Hancock were criticised for their failure to better prepare the UK.', 'Prisons | About 5,500 offenders will be released early from prison to “avert disaster”, the justice secretary has said. It is the first time the government has provided a figure for the number of prisoners who will be released in England and Wales as part of emergency measures.', 'Leeds | A police car was flipped on its side and a bus set alight after unrest broke out in Leeds on Thursday evening. Amid claims that the disorder was linked to children being taken into care, police said the disorder was “instigated by a criminal minority intent on disrupting community relations”.', 'Europe | Ursula von der Leyen has been voted in for a second term as European Commission president, winning an emphatic victory as mainstream groups in the European parliament united to deny a win for anti-EU and extreme right forces.', 'On Sunday, after the shocking attempt on his life at a campaign rally, Trump said that he had completely rewritten his speech – which, naturally, left some real gold on the cutting-room floor. “The speech I was going to give on Thursday was going to be a humdinger,” Trump told the Washington Examiner. “Honestly, it’s going to be a whole different speech now.”', 'That’s how it started. “I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America,” he said, in the kind of boilerplate unity language that might be deployed by any political candidate on either side. “To every citizen, whether you are young or old, man or woman, Democrat, Republican or independent, Black or white, Asian or Hispanic, I extend to you a hand of loyalty and friendship.” As he described the assassination attempt against him, a rapt audience listened in pin-drop silence, with many in the crowd in tears.', 'But before long, Trump switched gears, delivering something more like his standard stump speech: complaining about “witch hunts”, making false claims (you can see a fact-check here), and veering into rambling asides.', '“There were reasons to be sceptical of the new Trump who pivots to be unifying, and it did not last long,” David Smith said. “At first it felt written to go against his image. But then it turned into something like a typical rally speech, and we were back to Trump 1.0.”', 'What did Trump say?', 'Trump has cannily refrained from talking in detail about the attempt on his life until now, a decision likely intended to drive attention to at least the first part of his speech. The uniform of Corey Comperatore, the volunteer firefighter who was killed by the gunman on Saturday, was placed on stage, and Trump kissed the helmet before leading the crowd in a moment of silence. He suggested that divine intervention has saved him, describing the attack as a “providential experience” and saying: “In a certain way, I felt very safe, because I had God on my side.”', '“All that came across very powerfully,” David said. “I was down on the convention floor during that section, and his audience were lapping it up. The cult of personality is now on steroids.”', 'Before long, though, he was making wild claims about the success of his presidency and saying that migrants were responsible for “the greatest invasion in our history” and coming “from mental institutions and insane asylums”. He attacked the media and “crazy Nancy Pelosi”, praised Hungary’s nationalist, pro-Russia prime minister Viktor Orbán, made false claims about the 2020 election, and claimed crime rates are rocketing when in fact they are going down.', 'How did it go down?', 'Trump spoke for more than twice as long as intended, and some audience members began to file out from the upper tier of the auditorium before he came to an end. Nonetheless, the reception among Republicans was – unsurprisingly – deliriously positive.', 'When he talked about how close he came to death on Saturday, they listened attentively, laughed when he remarked that he had learned that ears “bleed more than any other part of the body, for whatever reason,” and, when he said “I’m not supposed to be here tonight,” chanted in response: “Yes you are!”', 'It had been a peculiar evening all in all, with former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan ripping off his shirt (above), MAGA’s resident rock-rap act Kid Rock leading the crowd in a chorus of “fight” to the apparent bemusement of Melania Trump, and a glancing reference from Trump to “the late great Hannibal Lecter”.', 'Amid the adulation, one Texas delegate, Mark Boldger, told the Guardian that Trump “might’ve put a few people to sleep tonight” and failed to “worked the crowd into the fever he normally does”. But more important than the crowd’s response is how it will be viewed by voters who probably haven’t watched the whole thing.', '“It started pretty late and it went on a long time,” David said. “A lot of people will have only watched the first bit, which was the call for unity. And they have a decent shot of the coverage leading on the story of the shooting, so it may be that news broadcasts will paint him in a fairly favourable light – and they can bury the 85% which was nonsense.”', 'How has the convention gone overall?', '“It has been a pretty disciplined convention, with the most extreme voices relatively marginalised,” David said. “The impression has been – we’re well ahead, let’s not do anything stupid to give the Democrats an opportunity.”', 'Scratch the surface, and there is plenty of the more familiar rhetoric on show despite the “unity” promise. As rightwing activist Laura Loomer told the New York Times: “I don’t want to be nice to demons.” But that tendency is now accompanied by an even more fervent, and even religious, devotion to the party’s standard-bearer. “They see something divine in him, which feels very dangerous,” David said. “Providence and the idea of God’s protective shield around Trump has been a theme all week.”', 'Ray Myers, a Texas delegate, told Reuters: “There’s some kind of mystical thing going on. After everything he’s been through, everything that’s been thrown at him, and now he’s even shed his own blood. And he’s still here. I don’t know how else you can explain it, but God is involved.”', 'Meanwhile, with the selection of JD Vance as his running mate, Trump has also emphasised his now total control over the party that was once bitterly divided over his rise. Vance, a populist who opposed Trump as “America’s Hitler” but is now among his most fervent supporters, made a speech that appeared to deliberately emphasise the defeat of old-fashioned business-oriented Republicans in favour of Trump’s brand of populism: “We’re done, ladies and gentlemen, catering to Wall Street,” he said. “We’ll commit to the working man.”', 'Where does all this leave Joe Biden?', 'Nowhere good. Biden, who has contracted Covid-19 and been forced to self-isolate in Delaware at a crucial moment for his candidacy, might have hoped that the focus on Trump since the Pennsylvania shooting would derail attempts to force him to stand down – but after a brief hiatus, they have now intensified once more.', 'The Senate leader, Chuck Schumer, and the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, have both privately told Biden in the last week that there are serious concerns about whether he can beat Biden – and warned that if nothing changes they could go public with their concerns, the New York Times reported.', 'A prominent House Democrat, Adam Schiff, has said openly that it is time for Biden to “pass the torch”. Now the Washington Post reports that Barack Obama has told allies that Biden must seriously consider whether his candidacy is still viable. Meanwhile, the Times reported that people close to Biden say they believe he has “begun to accept the idea that he may not be able to win in November and may have to drop out of the race”.', 'After the debate that was such a disaster for Biden, Trump appeared to deliberately refrain from hammering his opponent. In his speech, Trump only mentioned Biden once, and wasn’t scripted to say his embattled opponent’s name at all. “That is notionally part of the ‘unity’ message,” David said. “But it’s tactical not to take him on too aggressively. His team are full of bravado about whoever they might face – but they clearly think that Biden gives them their strongest chance of victory.”', 'Sign up to First Edition', 'Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters', 'after newsletter promotion', 'For the 25th anniversary of Destiny’s Child’s second studio album, The Writing’s on the Wall, Alexis Petridis has ranked their 25 best songs.

https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/jul/10/history-for-tomorrow-by-roman-krznaric-review-looking-back-moving-forward,"['From Arab scholars to hippy mothers, can history offer forgotten answers to modern problems?', 'We need lessons from history now more than ever. Mothers with young children sit isolated in their own homes, oblivious to 1970s experiments in communal child-rearing. Broadcasters justify populist content on the grounds that it’s what “ordinary people” want, despite the rich 19th-century tradition of working-class intellectualism. The current Labour leadership’s adherence to strict “fiscal rules” disregards past successes of borrowing to invest and taxing the highest incomes at 90%. These histories allow us to see that contemporary evils such as austerity and inequality are contingent, not inevitable: it doesn’t have to be this way.', 'The mindfulness mantra to ‘live in the present’ distracts us from the real problem: we are not living enough in the past. The perpetual ‘now’ of online life erodes our collective memory. Historical novels and TV series are in demand, but often as vehicles for escapism. History for Tomorrow could not, therefore, be timelier or more welcome. Roman Krznaric’s books include The Good Ancestor: How to Think Long-term in a Short-term World, and this latest is similarly focused on addressing global heating, social division and runaway AI in order to build a better future; this time mining history for precedents and paradigms that might offer forgotten solutions.', 'We begin in Jamaica in 1831, when 20,000 slaves lost patience with the high-minded gradualism of white elites, setting fire to plantations and seizing control of land: a revolt which proved to be “a crucial tipping point” in the history of abolition. Krznaric makes a broader case for this “radical flank effect”, where activists instigate a political crisis that accelerates the pace of change: see also Black Power and Extinction Rebellion (though whether the latter will be decisive in averting climate disaster remains to be seen).', 'Populist politicians like to associate anti-immigration sentiment with tradition rather than racism (at least in public); calling for more tolerance looks like an attack on established communities. Krznaric cites the counter-tradition of multiculturalism in medieval Andalusia, where Jews, Muslims and Christians rubbed along pretty well (though some scholars regard this view as rose-tinted). The forced proximity of city life facilitates conviviality: a phenomenon known as “contact theory”.', 'As overconsumption depletes planetary resources, Krznaric holds up the Japanese city of Edo, now Tokyo, where, from the 17th century onwards, the ruling shoguns responded to scarcity by instituting a strictly regulated zero-waste “circular economy” (one of many buzzwords in this book). Almost everything was reused, repaired or recycled: “drippings of candle wax were remoulded, old metal pots were melted down, human hair was sold to wigmakers”. The challenge now is how to simulate scarcity in an age of apparent consumerist abundance.', 'While top-down measures like Edo’s can be effective, Krznaric prefers grassroots, decentralised self-government, such as the water tribunal (Tribunal de las Aguas) established by Islamic rulers in medieval Valencia and still operating today, with local farmers coming together to enforce the fair allocation of this precious resource. It’s a system that challenges the pervasive idea that, left to their own devices, people will grab more than their share: the so-called “tragedy of the commons”.', 'There are cautionary tales here too, such as the eugenics movement that haunts the development of commercial gene editing technology. Better to look to the development of the polio vaccine and its proto-crowdfunding initiative (the “March of Dimes”) that raised enough cash to fund the largest medical field trial in American history, led by the virologist Jonas Salk. After his discovery of the vaccine in 1955, Salk was interviewed on TV by Ed Murrow, who asked him who owned the patent. “Well, the people, I would say,” Salk replied. “Could you patent the sun?” There is a message here for the vast, privatised biotech industry.', 'With efforts to reduce wealth inequality seemingly stalled, what can history tell us about what works? The economic historian Walter Scheidel has argued that greater equality is usually brought about by violent disruptions of the social order, such as war or revolution. More optimistically, the economist Thomas Piketty believes it is social and political struggles that make institutional change possible, such as the introduction of progressive wealth taxes. Krznaric identifies another such route in early 20th-century Kerala in southern India, where communists organised pay strikes, set up a network of “fair price” shops and public libraries and supported women to start collective enterprises.', 'Against the dystopian ravages of platform capitalism – Google, Microsoft, Uber and the rest – Krznaric pits the cooperative tradition that has long flourished in Italy’s Emilia-Romagna region: the University of Bologna was run by its students for its first three centuries. Or we can remember the American farmers who formed electricity cooperatives during the Great Depression with help from government loans under the New Deal (the most successful models, perhaps, combine the bottom-up with the top-down).', 'One key to avoiding civilisational collapse was offered as early as 1375 by the Arab scholar Ibn Khaldun in his book The Muqaddimah, an attempt to account for how once great north African cities had fallen into ruin. In 1400, the Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur (or Tamerlane) laid siege to Damascus. Hearing that Khaldun had been taken captive, Timur had him lowered by rope in a basket over the city walls into his camp to tell him his insights. Khaldun explained that fallen empires lacked asabiya, “collective solidarity”. The contemporary researchers Luke Kemp and Peter Turchin agree, arguing that the concentration of wealth and political inequality are the biggest drivers of social disintegration.', 'Solidarity has in the past been strengthened by the presence of an external threat, and unfortunately climate change doesn’t really feel like that. Some hope lies in identifying enemies within (fossil fuel companies and billionaires). Or we can rekindle “biophilia”, love for the natural world, expressed in John Evelyn’s 1664 book Sylva, which kickstarted a tree-planting craze, and in the explosion of nature poetry, Linnean botany and recreational gardening in the 18th century.', 'Despite abundant portents, we still harbour a residual Enlightenment belief in automatic progress (one idea we should jettison), leading, Krznaric notes, to dangerous complacency and what ecologists call the shifting baseline – or “boiling frogs” – syndrome: a tendency to underestimate long-term decline. Tech corporations claim that their products have created unprecedented opportunities for social connection and the sharing of information, but cosmopolitan coffee houses were already serving that up in the 1700s.', 'History buffs may be distracted by their own counter-examples that complicate the “lessons learned”, but Krznaric readily admits to cherrypicking: his aim is to lay out a smörgåsbord of ideas to choose from. The problem for me is the selection is a bit thin. Too much space is devoted to establishing well-trodden arguments that are surely already accepted by the book’s probable readership (climate change bad, multiculturalism good, consumerism bad, equality good), and too many of the examples are easily Googleable staples of left-green thinking. I wanted this book to dig deeper into the historical record, engage more thoroughly with debates about what makes change happen, and work harder to demonstrate how these precedents can be stitched into the here and now. Krznaric is fighting the good fight: he needs all the ammunition he can get.', 'History for Tomorrow: Inspiration from the Past for the Future of Humanity by Roman Krznaric is published by WH Allen (£22).

The editor has previously declared that his Irish nationality and his blog being hosted in the US meant that “I don’t have to pay attention to what a British judge orders me to do”.', 'Vince said: “He believes his ‘offshore’ structure protects him from being accountable, that he can flout our laws and disregard basic principles … With this legal action we hope to change that.”', 'The green energy businessman has been given permission by an English judge to serve libel papers on Staines via email and post to his home in Ireland. Staines declined to comment.', 'Vince is also seeking a website blocking order, which means that a London-based court could order British internet service providers to block access to specific blogposts. The approach is more commonly used in copyright cases, such as the blocking of illegal Premier League football streams.', 'The case hinges on a Guido Fawkes post from March entitled “Multi-million pound donor to Labour party says Hamas are ‘freedom fighters’”.

That’s how it works.”', 'The businessman claims the clip was used to imply that he supported the terrorist acts of Hamas, including “the mass murder, kidnapping and rape which took place on 7 October”.', 'The Daily Mail and GB News have already apologised and paid damages to Vince over similar stories.', 'Vince said in a statement: “Some weeks ago, the Guido Fawkes website published false claims about me which spread quickly amongst rightwing channels and commentators, probably in part due to the imminent election. The intention was clear, to damage my credibility as a person and as a Labour supporter.', '“We’ve secured numerous retractions with costs and damages already, such as from the Daily Mail and GB News, and for me this is the most important piece of the puzzle, the source. I’m pleased we’ve now been given permission to take action against the editor, Paul Staines.”', 'The Guido Fawkes site has previously said it asked Vince “to put on the record unambiguously that he does not think Hamas are freedom fighters”, in which case they “will be happy to withdraw and/or amend our previous reports accordingly”.', 'It added: “They stated he had previously condemned terrorism on the record. We accept and never claimed otherwise that Mr Vince has previously condemned terrorism, including saying of the specific acts of Hamas terrorism on the weekend of October 7, 2023: ‘I don’t support what they did.’ We remain baffled therefore why he won’t even through his lawyers confirm that he does not think Hamas are, in the words he used, ‘freedom fighters’.”', 'Guido Fawkes has links to the Tory party, having recently appointed the Conservative peer Ross Kempsell as a contributing editor.

Why isn’t she better known today?', 'My used copy of the first edition of The Disinherited Family arrives in the post from a secondhand bookseller in Lancashire. A dark blue hardback inscribed with the name of its first owner, Miss M Marshall, and the year of publication, 1924, it cost just £12.99. I am not a collector of old tomes but am thrilled to have this one. It has a case to be considered among the most important feminist economics books ever written.', 'Its centenary has so far received little, if any, attention. Yet the arguments it sets out are the reason nearly all mothers in the UK receive child benefit from the government. Its author, Eleanor Rathbone, was one of the most influential women in politics in the first half of the 20th century. She led the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship (Nusec, the main suffragist organisation, also formerly known as the National Union of Women Suffrage Societies) from 1919, when Millicent Fawcett stood down, until the roughly five million women who were not enfranchised in 1918 gained the vote 10 years later. In 1929, aged 57, she became an MP, and remained in parliament until her death in 1946. While there, she built up a formidable reputation based on her advocacy for women’s rights, welfare reform and the rights of refugees, and her opposition to the appeasement of Hitler.', 'It would not be true to say that Eleanor Rathbone has been forgotten. Her portrait by James Gunn hangs in the National Portrait Gallery. Twenty years ago she was the subject of a fine biography and she is remembered at Somerville college, Oxford – where she studied in the 1890s and ran a society called the Associated Prigs. (While the name was a joke, Rathbone did have a priggish side – as well as being an original thinker, tremendous campaigner, and stubborn, sensitive personality.) She also features in Rachel Reeves’s book The Women Who Made Modern Economics, although Reeves – who hopes shortly to become the UK’s first female chancellor – pays more attention to her contemporary, Beatrice Webb.', 'But Rathbone, who came from a wealthy dynasty of nonconformist merchants, does not have anything like the name-recognition of the Pankhursts or Millicent Fawcett, or of pioneering politicians including Nancy Astor and Ellen Wilkinson. Nor does she enjoy the cachet of writers such as Virginia Woolf, whose polemic about women’s opportunities, A Room of One’s Own, was published five years after Rathbone’s magnum opus.', 'There are many reasons for Rathbone’s relative obscurity. One is that she was the first woman elected to parliament as an independent (and one of a handful of men at the time). Thus there is no political party with an interest in turning her into an icon. Having spent the past three years writing a book about the British women’s movement, I am embarrassed to admit that when I started, I didn’t know who she was.', 'Rathbone was not the first person to propose state benefits paid to mothers. The endowment of motherhood or family allowances, as the policy was known, was written about by the Swedish feminist Ellen Key, and tried out as a project of the Fabian Women’s Group, who published their findings in a pamphlet in 1912. But Rathbone pushed the idea to the forefront. A first attempt to get Nusec to adopt it was knocked back in 1921, and she then spent three years conducting research. The title she gave the book she produced, The Disinherited Family, reflected her view that women and children were being deprived of their rightful share of the country’s wealth.', 'The problem, as she saw it, was one of distribution. While the wage system in industrialised countries treated all workers on a given pay grade the same, some households needed more money than others. While unions argued for higher wages across the board, Rathbone believed the state should supplement the incomes of larger families. She opened the book with an archly phrased rhetorical question: “Whether there is any subject in the world of equal importance that has received so little consideration as the economic status of the family?” She went on to accuse economists of behaving as if they were “self-propagating bachelors” – so little did the lives of mothers appear to interest them.', 'Rathbone’s twin aims were to end wives’ dependence on husbands and reward their domestic labour. Family allowances paid directly to them could either be spent on housekeeping or childcare, enabling them to go out to work. Ellen Wilkinson, the radical Labour MP for Middlesbrough (and future minister for education), was among early supporters. William Beveridge read the book when he was director of the London School of Economics, declared himself a convert and introduced one of the first schemes of family-linked payments for his staff.', 'But others were strongly opposed. Conservative objections to such a radical expansion of the state were predictable. But they were echoed by liberal feminists including Millicent Fawcett, who called the plan “a step in the direction of practical socialism”. Trade unions preferred to push for a living wage, while some male MPs thought the policy undermined the role of men as breadwinners. Labour and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) finally swung behind family allowances in 1942. As the war drew to a close, Rathbone led a backbench rebellion against ministers who wanted to pay the benefit to fathers instead.', 'It is for this signature policy that she is most often remembered today. At a time when hundreds of thousands of children have been pushed into poverty by the two-child limit on benefit payments, Rathbone’s advocacy on behalf of larger families could hardly be more relevant. The limit, devised by George Osborne, applies to universal and child tax credits – and not child benefit itself. But Rishi Sunak’s government announced changes to the latter in this year’s budget. From 2026, eligibility will be assessed on a household rather than individual basis. This is intended to limit payments to better-off, dual-income families. But the UK Women’s Budget Group and others have objected on grounds that child benefit should retain its original purpose of directly remunerating primary carers (the vast majority of them mothers) for the work of rearing children. It remains to be seen whether this plan will be carried through by the next government.', 'Rathbone once told the House of Commons she was “100% feminist”, and few MPs have been as single-minded in their commitment to women’s causes. As president of Nusec (the law-abiding wing of the suffrage campaign), she played a vital role in finishing the job of winning votes for women.', 'The last few years have seen a resurgence of interest in women’s suffrage, partly due to the centenary of the first women’s suffrage act. Thanks to a brilliant campaign by Caroline Criado Perez, a statue of Millicent Fawcett, the nonmilitant suffragist leader, now stands in Westminster, a few minutes walk from the bronze memorial of Emmeline Pankhurst erected in 1930. Suffragette direct action has long been a source of fascination. What is less well known is that militants played little part in the movement after 1918. It was law-abiding constitutionalists – suffragists rather than suffragettes – who pushed through the 1920s to win votes for the younger and poorer women who did not yet have them. Rathbone helped lead this final phase of the campaign, along with Conservative MP Nancy Astor and others.', 'Rathbone was highly critical of the militants, and once claimed that they “came within an inch of wrecking the suffrage movement, perhaps for a generation”. Today, with climate groups including Just Stop Oil copying the suffragette tactic of vandalising paintings, it is worth remembering that many women’s suffrage campaigners opposed such methods.', 'Schismatic though it was, the suffrage movement at least had a shared goal. An even greater challenge for feminists in the 1920s was agreeing on future priorities. Equal pay, parental rights and an end to the sexual double standard were among demands that had broad support. After the arrival in the House of Commons of the first female MPs, legislative successes included the removal of the bar on women’s entry to the professions, new rights for mothers and widows’ pensions. But there were also fierce disagreements.', 'Tensions between class and sexual politics were longstanding, with some on the left regarding feminism as a distraction. The Labour MP Marion Phillips, for example, thought membership of single-sex groups placed women “in danger of getting their political opinions muddled”. There was also renewed conflict over protective legislation – the name given to employment laws that differentiated between men and women. While such measures included maternity leave and safety rules for pregnant women, many feminists believed their true purpose was to keep jobs for men – and prevent female workers from competing.', 'Underlying such arguments was the question of whether women, once enfranchised, should strive for equal treatment, or push for measures designed to address their specific needs. As the debate grew more heated, partisans on either side gave themselves the labels of “old” and “new” feminists. While the former, also called equalitarians, wanted to focus on the obstacles that prevented women from participating in public life on the same terms as men, the new feminists led by Rathbone sought to pioneer an innovative, woman-centred politics. Since this brought to the fore issues such as reproductive health and mothers’ poverty, it is known as “maternalist feminism”.', 'The faultline extended beyond Britain. But Rathbone and her foes had some of the angriest clashes. At one international convention, Lady Rhondda, a wealthy former suffragette, used a speech to deride rivals who chose to “putter away” at welfare work, instead of the issues she considered important.', 'The specific policy points at issue have, of course, changed over the past century. But arguments about how much emphasis feminists should place on biological differences between men and women carry on.', 'Eleanor Rathbone did not live long enough to see the welfare state, including child benefit paid to mothers, take root in postwar Britain. Her election to parliament coincided with the Depression, and the lengthening shadows of fascism and nazism meant that she, like her colleagues, became preoccupied with foreign affairs. In the general election of 1935, the number of female MPs fell from 15 to nine, meaning Rathbone’s was one of just a handful of women’s voices. She used hers to oppose the policy of appeasement, and support the rights of refugees, including those escaping Franco’s Spain. During the war she helped run an extra-parliamentary “woman-power committee”, which advocated for female workers.', 'She also became a supporter of Indian women’s rights, though her liberal imperialism led to tensions with Indian feminists. During the war she angered India’s most eminent writer, Rabindranath Tagore, and its future prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, when she attacked the Congress party’s policy of noncooperation with Britain’s war effort. Tagore criticised what he called the “sheer insolent self-complacency” of her demand that the anti-colonial struggle should be set aside while Britain fought Germany.', 'Rathbone turned down a damehood. After their first shared house in Westminster was bombed, she and her life partner, the Scottish social worker Elizabeth Macadam, moved around the corner to a flat on Tufton Street (Macadam destroyed their letters, meaning that Rathbone’s intimate life remains obscure, but historians believe the relationship was platonic). From there they moved to a larger, quieter house in Highgate. On 2 January 1946, Rathbone suddenly died.', 'A blue plaque on Tufton Street commemorates her as the “pioneer of family allowances” – providing an alternative claim on posterity for an address more commonly associated with the Brexit campaign, since a house a few doors down became its headquarters. She is remembered, too, in Liverpool, where her experience of dispersing welfare to desperately poor soldiers’ wives in the first world war changed the course of her life, and where one of her former homes is being restored by the university.', 'I don’t believe in ghosts. But walking in Westminster recently, I imagined her hastening across St James’s Park to one of her meetings at Nancy Astor’s house near the London Library. Today, suffragettes are celebrated for their innovative direct action. But Rathbone blazed a trail, too, with her dedication as a campaigner, writer, lobbyist and “100% feminist” parliamentarian.', 'Sexed: A History of British Feminism by Susanna Rustin is published by Polity Press (£20).

On three previous occasions Labour has come to power after prolonged periods of Conservative rule, and each was accompanied by a powerful sense of sociocultural transformation.', 'History, as Mark Twain observed, doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes. Can Starmer inspire a similar effect that resonates far beyond parliament, or will it be a case of different party, same problems?', 'After 10 years of the Tories, Clement Attlee’s triumph in 1945 saw the birth of the welfare state and a more democratic idea of Britain. In 1964, Labour ended 13 years of torpid Conservatism, and suddenly the postwar monochrome world was awash with creative colour.', 'According to Philip Larkin, sexual intercourse only began in 1963, “Between the end of the ‘Chatterley’ ban/And the Beatles’ first LP.” It wasn’t just poetic licence, because a sexual liberation really was under way, along with a tectonic shift in mores, music, film and fashion.', 'In 1997, 18 long years of Conservatism came to a close as a Things Can Only Get Better optimism flourished. The energy of emerging British bands and artists conveyed the impression, encouraged by Tony Blair, that UK plc was a hip place to do business – at least until the young celebrities decided it was uncool to attend drinks parties with government squares. But there were also real-world improvements, not least in better-funded health and education.', 'Labour can usually rely on the backing of so-called “luvvies”, and a range of creative people signed a letter of support during Blair’s campaign, but there is no artistic movement, creative trend or generational feeling in the air to coincide with Starmer’s rise – no Britpop or YBAs or Trainspotting. He will have to create his own mood music.', 'Because, in conspicuous contrast to 1945, 1964 and 1997, Britain in 2024 doesn’t feel good about itself. Fourteen years of Tory governments have left the economy flatlining and the country depressed, the twin blows of Brexit and Covid having drained national confidence.', 'What, then, will be the cultural themes of Starmer’s Britain, the signs and symbols of renewal and fresh perspective? How will society order itself so we can say this is distinctive? And who will personify the temper of the times?', 'Few observers or voters expect radical changes ahead. The motivation driving many is disillusionment with what’s gone before, rather than excitement about what’s to come.', 'But the delineation of new eras can take shape in unlikely places, and perhaps that’s where we should look for clues as to any potential societal shifts. According to Tom Baldwin, the author of Keir Starmer: The Biography, the new cultural milieu is “not Soho House and Britpop parties. It’s more community football, kids learning flute in school, obscure indie bands from the 1980s.”', 'Starmer is fundamentally unflash, he says. “It’s not Camelot. It’s more Center Parcs.”', 'If Blair and Gordon Brown projected a new meritocracy – an Islingtonian world of modernist restaurants like the long-gone Granita and brash young movers and shakers like the more recently departed Derek Draper – then the Tories who replaced them were more about privileged backgrounds and well-connected social groups.', 'There was the Notting Hill set of David Cameron’s early years (director of strategy Steve Hilton and his wife Rachel Whetstone – remember them?), and then the Chipping Norton set of his second term – featuring such conservative luminaries as Rebekah Brooks and Jeremy Clarkson. Those groups lived on through the Tory administrations that followed, with their Old Etonians and Wykehamists, but they won’t fit into Starmer’s cosmos.', 'Baldwin suggests the political class’s ground zero is set to move to Kentish Town. “That’s where he has spent more than two decades of his life,” says Baldwin. “It’s a huge part of who he is. It’s not chi-chi – there are rough ends of it. On the back of his wallet, it says, ‘Take me home to Kentish Town’”.', 'What separates the Kentish Town set from its precursors is that it is determinedly not a power gathering. It features people like Colin Peacock. Who? Precisely. He’s an old Starmer friend who, aside from university days, has never lived more than 15 minutes from the Labour leader.', 'Peacock doesn’t have any interest in politics, a reason that Starmer finds him a grounding presence.', '“[Starmer] doesn’t locate himself in politics the way most people in politics do,” says Baldwin. “He locates himself in the life he had before he went into politics: family, friends, football.”', 'Hangout: The Pineapple pub', 'Of course, ever since football became a global obsession and mega-business, all politicians have learned to cite it as a key cultural reference point. In Starmer’s case, however, the interest appears to be authentic – even if he’s an Arsenal fan – and grassroots or, more accurately, astroturfroots. “He lives and breathes it,” says Baldwin.', 'So instead of the Campden Hill tennis club that boasts Cameron and the Johnsons as members, the new scene of social leisure could well be the Talacre Community Sports Centre in Kentish Town, where Starmer still plays football on an artificial pitch and also referees games – an unusual pairing of responsibilities that harsher critics might consider a conflict of interest.', 'The problem with football as a unifying concern is that people support different teams. But it would give a large section of the country – namely England – a feel-good factor boost if its team, so far a study in sleep-inducement, actually managed to win the Euros tournament. In 1966, Harold Wilson is said to have quipped that England only win the World Cup when Labour are in government. The flip side is that four years later England were knocked out of the World Cup quarter finals and four days after that Wilson lost the election to Ted Heath’s Tories.', 'Still, Starmer’s tendency to view life through football metaphors may help introduce a more demotic national conversation, and close the cultural gap between the rulers and the ruled. One thing we know is he likes to start out on the left and drift towards the centre, and sometimes, claim his detractors, he even takes up positions on the right wing.', 'Hangout: West stand, the Emirates', 'Just as Blair liked to take advantage of the hospitality of Silvio Berlusconi in Tuscany and Cliff Richard in Barbados, Cameron was a regular in the Balearics and Cornwall, and Johnson was partial to a freebie in Mustique, prime ministerial getaway destinations seem to say something about the occupants of No 10 that may not always be evident when they’re at home.', 'For PMs are not just politicians but also symbols of national interest and approved behaviour. In the age of Just Stop Oil, long-haul holidays are not the done thing.

It is a stretch to describe Peter Kennard’s dark-as-hell photo collages as jokes, but there is certainly shared methodology. Kennard weirds the familiar, creating jarring juxtapositions, and delivering electrifying visual shocks by way of punchline.', 'Archive of Dissent at Whitechapel Gallery covers over 50 years of Kennard’s work. His golden period arrived in the late 1970s and 1980s – the era of Thatcher, the GLC under Ken Livingstone and the protest camps at Greenham Common and Faslane. The political foes were iconic, the protests popular, and a flourishing print culture offered rich material to work from.', 'In Haywain with Cruise Missiles (1980) the wooden cart in John Constable’s beloved painting appears laden with American bombs. Kennard’s work was made the year RAF Greenham Common – in rural Berkshire, 89km west of London – was selected to be used as a nuclear missile bases by the US air force. In Thatcher Unmasked (1986) the former prime minister is seen removing her own face to reveal a death’s head lurking within.', 'He has quite the eye for a striking image. In a recent poster the Palestinian flag appears turned on end with the red trickling out of its triangle like a stream of blood or sand from an hourglass. A group of new works use the global market pages of the Financial Times. Some show furious hands ripping through the paper as though trapped within. In World Markets (2023) they carry charcoal portraits of people whose lives (we might infer) are being depleted in the interests of profit. Lights flick on and off behind the pink pages of Double Exposure (2023) showing familiar images from Kennard’s archive apparently woven into the paper itself, driving home the interrelation of commerce and geopolitics.', 'Kennard’s natural habitats include placards, public walls, pamphlets, flyers and newspaper – including this one. His striking photomontages appeared in the Guardian at key moments in the late 20th century: after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the beginning of negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa in 1990, and on the eve of the first Gulf war in 1991. An informal exhibition design reflects his preference for public sphere over gallery. Dozens of posters are shown in wall-mounted display racks available to flip through; 15,000 free “newspapers” are folded up on the floor of the gallery, there for the taking.', 'Kennard also honours the radical history of Whitechapel Gallery itself, and the former library building it occupies. Twenty-seven of his designs are presented on placards, each of their sticks weighted to the floor by a red industrial vice. He has titled the display People’s University of the East End – a reference, apparently, to a local nickname for the old library’s reading room, a space open to all to read newspapers, books, magazines and political pamphlets. Original newspapers carrying Kennard’s illustrations are displayed on old wooden lecterns in the adjacent gallery.', 'Might there be a spoonful of nostalgia stirred into all this? I think so. Although Kennard continues to make work in response to current events – Trump’s bellicose rhetoric, the war in Ukraine, the climate emergency – there is a self-conscious clunky DIY sensibility to the whole display that harks to a different era. The installation Boardroom (2023) projects the logos and mottoes of companies that profit from conflict (among them BAE Systems) on to an anonymous face printed on to a sheet of newsprint. The board behind is splintered and scuffed, and the clamps and rods used to hold everything in place are stubbornly visible. Perhaps Kennard feels it behoves him to expose the structures within his work, just as he exposes the structural links between conflict and corporate profit.', 'A cluttered vitrine of printed matter and art materials represents Kennard’s work environment and broadcasts his commitment to scalpel, gluepot and inks. The physicality of the original collages is striking – an image of Nelson Mandela’s face emerging between two broken pieces of a sign reading Whites Only/Net Blankes was constructed using an actual wooden sign, presumably obtained from South Africa.', 'What medium would a Kennard leaving art school now turn to? Would he be spray-painting walls? Would he make memes? Would he even have gone to art school?

A\xa0ban on custodial sentences of two years or less would mean that those who were convicted could serve an alternative method of punishment in the community. This would have the benefit of reducing numbers held on remand, as those who were likely to face a non-custodial sentence would be on bail. Administering a community-based restitution is a fraction of the cost of keeping a person in jail. As well as reducing pressure on prisons, this would help support an under-represented but particularly vulnerable group in our society – children of prisoners. It is well established that the outcomes for the families – particularly children – of prisoners are potentially very poor. This is especially true when multiple short sentences are involved that often result in a chaotic and unstable home life for those left behind. These children are more likely to suffer from a range of potentially debilitating outcomes, not least an increased risk of becoming offenders themselves.Name and address supplied', 'More meaningful purpose at the heart of our businesses needs consumers, ie us, to support them, ie buy from them, instead of from cheaper or slightly more convenient\xa0options (“The rich were led to believe they were different.
