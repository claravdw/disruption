You have appointed yourselves as the sole arbiters of what should be done about climate change, bound neither by the principles of democracy nor the rule of law.', '“And your fanaticism makes you entirely heedless of the rights of your fellow citizens. You have taken it upon yourselves to decide that your fellow citizens must suffer disruption and harm, and how much disruption and harm they must suffer, simply so that you may parade your views.”', 'Although all of the defendants ended the trial representing themselves, three of them – Hallam, Shaw and Whittaker De Abreu – instructed counsel to speak on their behalf in mitigation.', 'Each barrister sought unsuccessfully to persuade the judge that lengthy sentences could be avoided. Francesca Cociani, for Shaw, said the likelihood of his reoffending was lowered by the fact that the new Labour government had essentially met Just Stop Oil’s core demand by ending North Sea oil and gas exploration.', 'Gethin, who offered her own comments in mitigation, said: “I want to remind the court once more that my reasons for taking action were not beliefs or opinions. Earth’s life-support systems are breaking down due to human activities, whether we believe it or not.', '“These are not beliefs or opinions and feeling strongly that this is wrong is greatly understandable, I would argue. I deeply regret that this action was necessary … I maintain that it was necessary and I stand by my actions as the most effective option available to me.”', 'Supporters of the defendants expressed outrage at the sentences, which came after a two-week trial in which the judge denied them any of the defences in law for causing a public nuisance.', 'Hehir ruled that the jury should not take into account evidence about climate breakdown, which the defendants wanted to point to as the key motivation behind their actions, and which they said provided them with a reasonable excuse for them.', 'Michel Forst, the UN’s special rapporteur on environmental defenders, who attended part of the trial, issued a statement at its conclusion.', '“Today is a dark day for peaceful environmental protest” in the UK, he said. “This sentence should shock the conscience of any member of the public. It should also put all of us on high alert on the state of civic rights and freedoms in the United Kingdom.', '“Rulings like today’s set a very dangerous precedent, not just for environmental protest but any form of peaceful protest that may, at one point or another, not align with the interests of the government of the day.”', 'Greenpeace UK’s programme director, Amy Cameron, said: “What sort of country locks people away for years for planning a peaceful demonstration, let alone for talking about it on a Zoom call? We’re giving a free hand to the polluting elite robbing us of a habitable planet while jailing those who’re trying to stop them – it makes no sense.', '“These sentences are not a one-off anomaly but the culmination of years of repressive legislation, overblown government rhetoric and a concerted assault on the right of juries to deliberate according to their conscience. It’s part of the mess the Labour government has inherited from its predecessor and they must fix it by giving back to people the right to protest that’s been slowly being taken away from them.”', 'Separately on Thursday, three airports were granted high court injunctions against fossil fuel and environmental activists protesting at their sites. Leeds Bradford airport, London Luton airport and Newcastle international airport were given injunctions banning protesters from trespassing or causing a nuisance.']",,['Damien Gayle'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c57623c67e1106f79eaeb61410b02c21f31dbc56/98_113_1285_771/master/1285.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'The five defendants smiling in a group pose in a church yard'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cd57ad10c38e1549edf2ca746d1cbf9de9733cf/0_261_7830_4698/master/7830.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Police officers on the M25 after an activist put a Just Stop Oil banner on the gantry during the motorway protest in November 2022.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7d8249bcc18107471157e683750a650319c2fc9/0_198_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Roger Hallam in front of a protest banner']]"
