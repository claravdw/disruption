The information center will include posts from trusted scientific sources, rated by fact-checkers.', '“As with all types of claims debunked by our fact-checkers, we reduce the distribution of these posts in News Feed and apply a warning label on top of these posts both on Facebook and Instagram so people understand that the content has been rated false,” the company said.', 'But climate organizations have questioned whether Facebook is doing enough to cut down on untruths about the climate crisis that are spread across the site.

The proposal sets the stage for an intense political battle over the autumn to agree the target, intended to set the EU on track to meet a landmark pledge of net-zero emissions by the middle of the century.', 'But critics say Brussels is guilty of an “accounting trick” that makes the proposed 2030 target look higher than it really is. The row turns on the concept of “removals”, a reference to sinks that absorb more carbon than they emit, such as forests and soils.', 'The leaked draft regulation states that “by 2030 greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced and removals enhanced, so that net greenhouse gas emissions, that is emissions after deduction of removals are reduced economy-wide and domestically, by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.”', 'The previous version of the legal proposal, published in March, made no mention of removals in this context: the commission promised to “explore options for a new 2030 target of 50 to 55% emission reductions compared with 1990 levels”.', 'Greenpeace said the change was “risky” because nature was under massive pressure from global heating and biodiversity loss, highlighted by forest fires in western US, the Amazon and the Arctic.', '“This accounting trick by the commission would make any new target sound higher than it actually is,” said Sebastian Mang, climate and energy policy adviser at Greenpeace. “You can’t win a 100-metre race if you get someone else to run the last 20 metres. That’s called cheating. Restoring nature is essential, but must be additional to efforts to cut emissions in the most polluting sectors.”', 'The EU 2050 net-zero target means greenhouse gas emissions would be offset by carbon sinks. But the current 2030 target – a 40% emissions reduction compared to 1990 levels – does not include offsets.', 'Michael Bloss, a German Green MEP, told the Guardian the inclusion of removals was a deviation from the current system that could weaken the 2030 target. “It is a concern as the current legal framework for the EU’s 2030 target … defines the absolute reduction in greenhouse gas emissions,” he said.', 'The MEP added that deviating from the current approach was a form of “creative accounting” that would “undermine the leadership claim Europe wants to take” in UN climate talks.', 'The commission argues it makes sense to include carbon sinks, in line with the 2050 net-zero target. An EU official said the allegation of creative accounting was “incorrect” because “we also adjust the baseline for 1990 retrospectively” meaning there would be no “free” emissions reductions.', '“The accounting is still valid,” the source said. “I acknowledge there is still a discussion about where the EU carbon sink is and what it absorbs. That is to be clarified in the impact assessment for the LULUCF proposal that we will present next year,” they added, referring to another EU climate law governing land use, land use change and forestry.', 'The row comes after the European parliament’s environment committee voted last week for a 60% emissions reduction target by 2030, without including carbon sinks. The Greens, however, wanted a 65% target, which they argued was “the only way we will be able to keep global temperature rises under 1.5C [above pre-industrial levels] and stave off the worst effects of the climate crisis”.', 'Bloss added: “What we need is leadership on climate with a target in line with the science and not new uncertainties or even a further weakening of the 2030 target.”', 'The European commission said it did not comment on leaked documents.', 'Meanwhile, more than 150 companies have urged EU leaders to adopt tougher emissions targets for 2030. An open letter signed by 152 businesses and investment groups, including Microsoft, Unilever, Ikea and H&M, said the EU should reduce greenhouse gas emissions “by at least 55% by 2030”.', '“From a business and investor perspective, clarity on the net-zero transition pathway and timetables for each sector, as well as policy that enables substantial investments in carbon neutral solutions is essential,” states the text, also signed by Deutsche Bank, EDF and Google. “This in turn would provide us with the confidence needed to invest decisively at the necessary pace and scale.”']",['Jennifer Rankin'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42cff76ebdf9b49444539650b27421d2a67a640d/0_102_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'Greenpeace activists roll down a 30-metre banner at the headquarters of the EU Commission protesting against the ongoing damage to the Amazon.']]",

Being brave, gung ho gals, Catherine and Rosanna were all for it and pledged to join me when they could.', 'Over the next few days we hiked, and I kept reading Naomi’s book. I felt more strongly that if I got the word out, others would join me. It had happened before during the later years of the Vietnam war. I’ve done a lot of camping in my life and had all the right equipment, but I’d never camped in a city. Where will I poop and pee? I wondered. I’m way older now and have to get up during the night more often. We studied maps of DC, trying to pick a spot where I would set up, but I realised I didn’t want a lonely vigil.

In fact, leaps of faith are my only form of exercise these days.', 'There was a long silence, and then she said, “Well, Jane, that’s wonderful and I’m blown away that you’re ready to put yourself out there like that, but you can’t camp overnight in Washington. It’s illegal since Occupy Wall Street camped there. But let’s figure out what is possible.” She offered to set up a conference call with her, Bill McKibben, co-founder of 350.org, Naomi Klein, the environmental lawyer Jay Halfon, and me. Bill suggested a once-a-week protest that involved civil disobedience. Fridays had been claimed by Greta Thunberg and the student climate strikers, but the youth had also called on adults to join them. “Maybe you could do an action on Fridays as well.”', 'I’d been getting ready for this my whole adult life – a weekly action that culminated in nonviolent civil disobedience.

It’s structural change that we need to focus on while continuing our individual commitments to the planet. Maybe the Friday actions would help bring about that policy change.', 'On 27 September, en route to the Los Angeles airport, my little Tulea had a seizure; she had been diagnosed with an enlarged heart.

A new coronavirus was sweeping the world. Politicians had to make their most consequential decisions in decades, and fast. Many of those decisions depended on data detective work that epidemiologists, medical statisticians and economists were scrambling to conduct. Tens of millions of lives were potentially at risk.

And the tests that were being conducted were giving a skewed picture, being focused on medical staff, critically ill patients, and – let’s face it – rich, famous people. It took several months to build a picture of how many mild or asymptomatic cases there are, and hence how deadly the virus really is. As the death toll rose exponentially in March, doubling every two days in the UK, there was no time to wait and see. Leaders put economies into an induced coma – more than 3 million Americans filed jobless claims in a single week in late March, five times the previous record. The following week was even worse: more than 6.5m claims were filed. Were the potential health consequences really catastrophic enough to justify sweeping away so many people’s incomes? It seemed so – but epidemiologists could only make their best guesses with very limited information.', 'It’s hard to imagine a more extraordinary illustration of how much we usually take accurate, systematically gathered numbers for granted. The statistics for a huge range of important issues that predate the coronavirus have been painstakingly assembled over the years by diligent statisticians, and often made available to download, free of charge, anywhere in the world. Yet we are spoiled by such luxury, casually dismissing “lies, damned lies and statistics”. The case of Covid-19 reminds us how desperate the situation can become when the statistics simply aren’t there.', 'When it comes to interpreting the world around us, we need to realise that our feelings can trump our expertise. This explains why we buy things we don’t need, fall for the wrong kind of romantic partner, or vote for politicians who betray our trust. In particular, it explains why we so often buy into statistical claims that even a moment’s thought would tell us cannot be true. Sometimes, we want to be fooled.', 'Psychologist Ziva Kunda found this effect in the lab, when she showed experimental subjects an article laying out the evidence that coffee or other sources of caffeine could increase the risk to women of developing breast cysts. Most people found the article pretty convincing. Women who drank a lot of coffee did not.', 'We often find ways to dismiss evidence that we don’t like. And the opposite is true, too: when evidence seems to support our preconceptions, we are less likely to look too closely for flaws. It is not easy to master our emotions while assessing information that matters to us, not least because our emotions can lead us astray in different directions.', 'We don’t need to become emotionless processors of numerical information – just noticing our emotions and taking them into account may often be enough to improve our judgment. Rather than requiring superhuman control of our emotions, we need simply to develop good habits. Ask yourself: how does this information make me feel? Do I feel vindicated or smug? Anxious, angry or afraid? Am I in denial, scrambling to find a reason to dismiss the claim?', 'In the early days of the coronavirus epidemic, helpful-seeming misinformation spread even faster than the virus itself. One viral post – circulating on Facebook and email newsgroups – all-too-confidently explained how to distinguish between Covid-19 and a cold, reassured people that the virus was destroyed by warm weather, and incorrectly advised that iced water was to be avoided, while warm water kills any virus. The post, sometimes attributed to “my friend’s uncle”, sometimes to “Stanford hospital board” or some blameless and uninvolved paediatrician, was occasionally accurate but generally speculative and misleading. But still people – normally sensible people – shared it again and again and again. Why? Because they wanted to help others. They felt confused, they saw apparently useful advice, and they felt impelled to share. That impulse was only human, and it was well-meaning – but it was not wise.', 'Before I repeat any statistical claim, I first try to take note of how it makes me feel. It’s not a foolproof method against tricking myself, but it’s a habit that does little harm, and is sometimes a great deal of help. Our emotions are powerful. We can’t make them vanish, and nor should we want to. But we can, and should, try to notice when they are clouding our judgment.', 'In 1997, the economists Linda Babcock and George Loewenstein ran an experiment in which participants were given evidence from a real court case about a motorbike accident. They were then randomly assigned to play the role of plaintiff’s attorney (arguing that the injured motorcyclist should receive $100,000 in damages) or defence attorney (arguing that the case should be dismissed or the damages should be low).', 'The experimental subjects were given a financial incentive to argue their side of the case persuasively, and to reach an advantageous settlement with the other side. They were also given a separate financial incentive to accurately guess what the damages the judge in the real case had actually awarded. Their predictions should have been unrelated to their role-playing, but their judgment was strongly influenced by what they hoped would be true.', 'Psychologists call this “motivated reasoning”. Motivated reasoning is thinking through a topic with the aim, conscious or unconscious, of reaching a particular kind of conclusion. In a football game, we see the fouls committed by the other team but overlook the sins of our own side. We are more likely to notice what we want to notice. Experts are not immune to motivated reasoning. Under some circumstances their expertise can even become a disadvantage. The French satirist Molière once wrote: “A learned fool is more foolish than an ignorant one.” Benjamin Franklin commented: “So convenient a thing is it to be a reasonable creature, since it enables us to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to.”', 'Modern social science agrees with Molière and Franklin: people with deeper expertise are better equipped to spot deception, but if they fall into the trap of motivated reasoning, they are able to muster more reasons to believe whatever they really wish to believe.', 'One recent review of the evidence concluded that this tendency to evaluate evidence and test arguments in a way that is biased towards our own preconceptions is not only common, but just as common among intelligent people. Being smart or educated is no defence. In some circumstances, it may even be a weakness.', 'One illustration of this is a study published in 2006 by two political scientists, Charles Taber and Milton Lodge. They wanted to examine the way Americans reasoned about controversial political issues. The two they chose were gun control and affirmative action.', 'Taber and Lodge asked their experimental participants to read a number of arguments on either side, and to evaluate the strength and weakness of each argument. One might hope that being asked to review these pros and cons might give people more of a shared appreciation of opposing viewpoints; instead, the new information pulled people further apart.', 'This was because people mined the information they were given for ways to support their existing beliefs. When invited to search for more information, people would seek out data that backed their preconceived ideas. When invited to assess the strength of an opposing argument, they would spend considerable time thinking up ways to shoot it down.', 'This isn’t the only study to reach this sort of conclusion, but what’s particularly intriguing about Taber and Lodge’s experiment is that expertise made matters worse. More sophisticated participants in the experiment found more material to back up their preconceptions. More surprisingly, they found less material that contradicted them – as though they were using their expertise actively to avoid uncomfortable information. They produced more arguments in favour of their own views, and picked up more flaws in the other side’s arguments. They were vastly better equipped to reach the conclusion they had wanted to reach all along.', 'Of all the emotional responses we might have, the most politically relevant are motivated by partisanship. People with a strong political affiliation want to be on the right side of things. We see a claim, and our response is immediately shaped by whether we believe “that’s what people like me think”.', 'Consider this claim about climate change: “Human activity is causing the Earth’s climate to warm up, posing serious risks to our way of life.” Many of us have an emotional reaction to a claim like that; it’s not like a claim about the distance to Mars. Believing it or denying it is part of our identity; it says something about who we are, who our friends are, and the sort of world we want to live in. If I put a claim about climate change in a news headline, or in a graph designed to be shared on social media, it will attract attention and engagement not because it is true or false, but because of the way people feel about it.', 'If you doubt this, ponder the findings of a Gallup poll conducted in 2015. It found a huge gap between how much Democrats and Republicans in the US worried about climate change. What rational reason could there be for that?', 'Scientific evidence is scientific evidence. Our beliefs around climate change shouldn’t skew left and right. But they do. This gap became wider the more education people had. Among those with no college education, 45% of Democrats and 23% of Republicans worried “a great deal” about climate change. Yet among those with a college education, the figures were 50% of Democrats and 8% of Republicans. A similar pattern holds if you measure scientific literacy: more scientifically literate Republicans and Democrats are further apart than those who know very little about science.', 'If emotion didn’t come into it, surely more education and more information would help people to come to an agreement about what the truth is – or at least, the current best theory? But giving people more information seems actively to polarise them on the question of climate change. This fact alone tells us how important our emotions are. People are straining to reach the conclusion that fits with their other beliefs and values – and the more they know, the more ammunition they have to reach the conclusion they hope to reach.', 'In the case of climate change, there is an objective truth, even if we are unable to discern it with perfect certainty. But as you are one individual among nearly 8 billion on the planet, the environmental consequences of what you happen to think are irrelevant. With a handful of exceptions – say, if you’re the president of China – climate change is going to take its course regardless of what you say or do. From a self-centred point of view, the practical cost of being wrong is close to zero. The social consequences of your beliefs, however, are real and immediate.', 'Imagine that you’re a barley farmer in Montana, and hot, dry summers are ruining your crop with increasing frequency. Climate change matters to you. And yet rural Montana is a conservative place, and the words “climate change” are politically charged. Anyway, what can you personally do about it?', 'Here’s how one farmer, Erik Somerfeld, threads that needle, as described by the journalist Ari LeVaux: “In the field, looking at his withering crop, Somerfeld was unequivocal about the cause of his damaged crop – ‘climate change’. But back at the bar, with his friends, his language changed. He dropped those taboo words in favour of ‘erratic weather’ and ‘drier, hotter summers’ – a not-uncommon conversational tactic in farm country these days.”', 'If Somerfeld lived in Portland, Oregon, or Brighton, East Sussex, he wouldn’t need to be so circumspect at his local tavern – he’d be likely to have friends who took climate change very seriously indeed. But then those friends would quickly ostracise someone else in the social group who went around loudly claiming that climate change is a Chinese hoax.', 'So perhaps it is not so surprising after all to find educated Americans poles apart on the topic of climate change. Hundreds of thousands of years of human evolution have wired us to care deeply about fitting in with those around us. This helps to explain the findings of Taber and Lodge that better-informed people are actually more at risk of motivated reasoning on politically partisan topics: the more persuasively we can make the case for what our friends already believe, the more our friends will respect us.', 'It’s far easier to lead ourselves astray when the practical consequences of being wrong are small or non-existent, while the social consequences of being “wrong” are severe. It’s no coincidence that this describes many controversies that divide along partisan lines.', 'It’s tempting to assume that motivated reasoning is just something that happens to other people. I have political principles; you’re politically biased; he’s a fringe conspiracy theorist. But we would be wiser to acknowledge that we all think with our hearts rather than our heads sometimes.', 'Kris De Meyer, a neuroscientist at King’s College, London, shows his students a message describing an environmental activist’s problem with climate change denialism:', 'To summarise the climate deniers’ activities, I think we can say that:', '(1) Their efforts have been aggressive while ours have been defensive.', '(2) The deniers’ activities are rather orderly – almost as if they had a plan working for them.', 'I think the denialist forces can be characterised as dedicated opportunists. They are quick to act and seem to be totally unprincipled in the type of information they use to attack the scientific community. There is no question, though, that we have been inept in getting our side of the story, good though it may be, across to the news media and the public.', 'The students, all committed believers in climate change, outraged at the smokescreen laid down by the cynical and anti-scientific deniers, nod in recognition. Then De Meyer reveals the source of the text. It’s not a recent email. It’s taken, sometimes word for word, from an infamous internal memo written by a cigarette marketing executive in 1968. The memo is complaining not about “climate deniers” but about “anti-cigarette forces”, but otherwise, few changes were required.', 'You can use the same language, the same arguments, and perhaps even have the same conviction that you’re right, whether you’re arguing (rightly) that climate change is real or (wrongly) that the cigarette-cancer link is not.', '(Here’s an example of this tendency that, for personal reasons, I can’t help but be sensitive about. My left-leaning, environmentally conscious friends are justifiably critical of ad hominem attacks on climate scientists. You know the kind of thing: claims that scientists are inventing data because of their political biases, or because they’re scrambling for funding from big government. In short, smearing the person rather than engaging with the evidence.', 'Yet the same friends are happy to embrace and amplify the same kind of tactics when they are used to attack my fellow economists: that we are inventing data because of our political biases, or scrambling for funding from big business. I tried to point out the parallel to one thoughtful person, and got nowhere. She was completely unable to comprehend what I was talking about. I’d call this a double standard, but that would be unfair – it would suggest that it was deliberate. It’s not. It’s an unconscious bias that’s easy to see in others and very hard to see in ourselves.)', 'Our emotional reaction to a statistical or scientific claim isn’t a side issue. Our emotions can, and often do, shape our beliefs more than any logic. We are capable of persuading ourselves to believe strange things, and to doubt solid evidence, in service of our political partisanship, our desire to keep drinking coffee, our unwillingness to face up to the reality of our HIV diagnosis, or any other cause that invokes an emotional response.', 'But we shouldn’t despair. We can learn to control our emotions – that is part of the process of growing up. The first simple step is to notice those emotions. When you see a statistical claim, pay attention to your own reaction. If you feel outrage, triumph, denial, pause for a moment. Then reflect. You don’t need to be an emotionless robot, but you could and should think as well as feel.', 'Most of us do not actively wish to delude ourselves, even when that might be socially advantageous. We have motives to reach certain conclusions, but facts matter, too. Lots of people would like to be movie stars, billionaires or immune to hangovers, but very few people believe that they actually are. Wishful thinking has limits. The more we get into the habit of counting to three and noticing our knee-jerk reactions, the closer to the truth we are likely to get.', 'For example, one survey, conducted by a team of academics, found that most people were perfectly able to distinguish serious journalism from fake news, and also agreed that it was important to amplify the truth, not lies. Yet the same people would happily share headlines such as “Over 500 ‘Migrant Caravaners’ Arrested With Suicide Vests”, because at the moment at which they clicked “share”, they weren’t stopping to think. They weren’t thinking, “Is this true?”, and they weren’t thinking, “Do I think the truth is important?”', 'Instead, as they skimmed the internet in that state of constant distraction that we all recognise, they were carried away with their emotions and their partisanship. The good news is that simply pausing for a moment to reflect was all it took to filter out a lot of the misinformation. It doesn’t take much; we can all do it. All we need to do is acquire the habit of stopping to think.', 'Inflammatory memes or tub-thumping speeches invite us to leap to the wrong conclusion without thinking. That’s why we need to be calm.

But after Europe cracked down on migration, its crew found themselves facing prosecution', 'As patrol boats with flashing blue lights surrounded the Iuventa, just outside the port of Lampedusa on the evening of 1 August 2017, its crew were more annoyed than alarmed. For three days, the old fishing trawler, crewed by volunteers from the German NGO Jugend Rettet (Youth Rescue), had answered a string of requests from the Italian coastguard that to them made no sense. “This madness hopefully will soon be over,” read a message sent from the ship’s bridge to Jugend Rettet base camp shortly after 10pm.', 'In the summer of 2017, two years on from the peak of Europe’s refugee crisis, smugglers in Libya were still sending hundreds of people a day to sea in unsafe rubber boats, and the Iuventa’s crew wanted to be where the action was. In a patch of sea just off the coast of north Africa, about a dozen NGO ships were searching for boats in distress – a direct challenge, as many of them saw it, to European governments that had scaled back state-run rescue efforts.', 'Yet the Iuventa had been following instructions that drew it further away from the rescue zone and closer to Italian territorial waters. According to the ship’s records, the Italian coastguard first told the crew to rendezvous with an Italian navy ship to collect two men found adrift at sea, and deliver them to another. The second ship never turned up. Then they were told to look for a blue and white fishing boat with 50 people on board, apparently foundering in the sea close to Lampedusa. As night fell on 1 August, after a day spent searching the waves in vain, a message came through: call off your search and proceed into port.', 'It was the third time in a few months that the ship had been ordered into the harbour at Lampedusa. In just over a year, the Iuventa – crewed by a group of young, motivated people “who could not stand to see the situation in the Mediterranean any longer”, as one put it to me – rescued more than 14,000 people. Most of these rescues were coordinated by the Italian coastguard, but the relationship was increasingly strained. The Iuventa’s revolving crew of volunteers were outspoken critics of Europe’s border policies, and the small, agile ship took more risks than some of the larger NGO vessels, sailing as close as possible to Libyan waters in order to be able to rescue people from unsafe boats sooner. As one Italian media outlet put it, the ship was “like a sort of Berliner squat out in the middle of the sea – very well organised, radical and antagonistic”.', 'As the Iuventa entered the harbour of Lampedusa, the crew expected to be questioned briefly by police, as they had been on previous occasions, then allowed to get back to work. They were wrong. Within a few hours, their ship would be seized, marking the beginning of a long and still unresolved criminal investigation that leaves 10 humanitarian volunteers facing up to 20 years in prison.', 'In the small hours of 2 August, while a crowd of journalists assembled on the quayside filmed and took photographs, detectives specialising in organised crime searched the Iuventa. The following morning, before the crew were even fully informed of the case against them, details were splashed across the Italian media. This “German extremist NGO”, as one newspaper later put it, was suspected of aiding illegal immigration – a crime in Italian law – by collaborating with Libyan smugglers. News outlets quoted liberally from a case file that showed the Iuventa had been under surveillance for months: there were even transcripts from a recording device placed on the ship’s bridge. Police photographs, labelled and distributed to news agencies, purported to show several occasions on which the ship’s crew had received migrants directly from boats driven by smugglers themselves.', '“We don’t have anything to hide, and we are looking forward to returning to the search and rescue zone one day, to fight for human rights,” declared a member of the crew, who gave her name as Katrin, in a video statement released to the media. But these were explosive allegations, at a time when migration had become such a toxic issue that Italy’s interior minister declared he “feared for the democratic integrity of the country”. Italy’s populist opposition parties led the charge against rescuers, accusing them of being taxi del mare, a “sea taxi” service for migrants, while the government was pressuring NGOs to limit their operations. In the spring of 2017, two other NGOs had been investigated – but this was the first time a ship had been seized. Within months, under the looming threat of prosecution, NGOs were all but forced out of the Mediterranean.', 'Today, the Iuventa remains impounded, and 10 of its crew members are still waiting to find out if they will face trial. They deny ever working with smugglers, and have assembled documentary evidence that they say proves their innocence. More disturbingly, investigative journalists in Italy and elsewhere have unearthed evidence which appears to show that the surveillance began not with the Italian state, but with a spying plot involving a private security agency and the far-right political leader Matteo Salvini.', 'The case is not yet over, but it has already marked a turning point: in just a few years, Europe has gone from saving lives at sea to attacking the people who do it. And it all began with the moment, in the words of the Italian author and migration specialist Annalisa Camilli, that “humanitarians were transformed from angels at sea into dangerous collaborators with smugglers”.', 'More than three years since he last sailed a rescue mission, Dariush Beigui’s mind still clicks into gear when he sees news of a boat in distress in the Mediterranean. The German skipper, a punk rock fan who pilots barges around the port of Hamburg for a living, mentally prepares to wake up his crewmates, to manoeuvre the Iuventa into position and scan the horizon with binoculars, ready to dispatch the ship’s speedboat. But with the Iuventa sitting idle in the Sicilian port of Trapani, none of this is possible. “The hardest thing for me is to sit here watching social media, knowing that if I was there I could help,” he told me. “Maybe not to rescue everybody, but at least one person.”', 'I met Beigui in Berlin in early 2020, along with two other members of the “Iuventa 10”, Hendrik Simon and Sascha Girke. All three, now in their early 40s, volunteered to work on the Iuventa after Jugend Rettet launched in 2015 via a crowdfunding campaign. Many of the volunteers knew each other from past campaigns in environmentalist, antifascist and squatting movements, and they brought practical skills to the Mediterranean, along with a DIY ethos: Girke works as a paramedic in a town outside Berlin; Simon, an IT technician from Bremen, had driven speedboats for Greenpeace.', 'In the summer of 2016, when the Iuventa first went to sea, the number of people crossing the central Mediterranean from Libya was at record levels. The people-smuggling trade, once tightly controlled by the former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on Europe’s behalf, had boomed as the country collapsed into civil war. Since the overthrow of Gaddafi in 2011, tens of thousands of people a year – displaced by war, looking for work, or just desperate to get out of Libya – paid for passage on overcrowded inflatable dinghies that were pushed out to sea with only a few hours’ worth of fuel. Unless given assistance, once they got into open water, these boats would sink. In 2016, more than 4,500 people drowned or went missing in the Mediterranean.', 'An increasing proportion of the rescues were carried out by private organisations. By 2016, nine separate charities, from global aid agencies such as Save the Children and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) to smaller, newly formed groups, patrolled international waters close to Libya.', 'The Iuventa quickly gained a reputation as one of the more daring rescue outfits. “Saving people from drowning is always a humanitarian act,” Simon told me, “[but] I was going there as a political activist because I don’t agree with European border policies.” While the Iuventa put its speed and agility to use at sea, Jugend Rettet’s volunteers held protest actions on land, calling for “ferries not Frontex” – the provocative suggestion, with reference to the EU’s border agency, that migrants should be allowed to travel freely.', 'Yet 2016 was also the year that anti-refugee politics came to the fore in Europe and the US. Italy, where the majority of people rescued off the coast of Libya disembarked, was finding itself increasingly isolated. Three years earlier, in response to a growing number of shipwrecks on its southern border, Italy had taken the bold step of sending its navy out into international waters to search for boats in distress. The country’s centre-left government gambled that the operation, which it called Mare Nostrum – “our sea” in Latin, after the ancient Roman name for the Mediterranean – would prompt its European neighbours into supporting the rescue effort, and helping look after the people rescued.', 'The hoped-for support never arrived. Mare Nostrum was replaced by a far smaller EU operation, while responsibility for accommodating new arrivals remained with the country in which they disembarked. As Europe’s increasingly panicked governments discussed how to reduce migration across the Mediterranean, Italy’s neighbours began to seal off their land borders, preventing asylum seekers from continuing their journeys. By late 2016, around 200,000 people were stuck in Italy’s slow-moving asylum system, management of which cost well over €3bn a year.', 'Italian coastguard officials began to take a less welcoming attitude to the NGO rescuers. “There was increasingly this delaying and questioning of our missions,” said Girke, who volunteered multiple times as coordinator, either on board the Iuventa or at Jugend Rettet base camp on Malta. One point of contention seemed to be that the Iuventa would often transfer the people it picked up to better-equipped larger ships, so it could quickly return to the rescue zone. According to Girke, officials would often try to insist that the Iuventa took all the people it had rescued back to port – he suspects, to slow down its operations.', 'In October 2016, three employees of a private security agency visited police in Trapani. The three had been working as security guards on board the Vos Hestia, a ship chartered by the UK aid organisation Save the Children, as a condition of the vessel’s insurance. On 10 September, the Vos Hestia had crossed paths with the Iuventa during a rescue: a long, gruelling day of pulling people out of the water, in which six dinghies, each with more than a hundred people onboard, were adrift and sinking. The Iuventa’s deck had become dangerously busy, and the Vos Hestia was one of several ships that arrived to help relieve the pressure.', 'One of the security guards, Pietro Gallo, told police that shortly after the Vos Hestia took some of the Iuventa’s passengers on board, he saw a dinghy heading away from the Iuventa, driven by two “dark-skinned” men. This, he said, “made us believe that the crew of the Iuventa had received migrants from the dinghy … which was returning to the [Libyan] coast with the smugglers onboard.” The security guards assumed this meant that the Iuventa had collected migrants from smugglers by prior arrangement, rather than rescuing people whose lives were in danger.', 'Had the Iuventa’s crew committed a crime? They say they had no contact with smugglers, pointing out that no evidence besides the security guards’ testimony has been offered for the incident, and that several other vessels including an Irish navy ship were present at the scene. Nor, they say, was the alleged incident mentioned in the official Frontex report on that day’s rescue. But after the allegations from security guards, prosecutors in Trapani authorised a surveillance operation, placing an undercover officer on Save the Children’s ship. The officer would pose as a security guard alongside Gallo and his colleagues, watching the Iuventa from afar.', 'In late November, the Iuventa entered port for the winter. By the end of the year, 181,436 people had been rescued from the central Mediterranean – and Italy appeared to welcome the contribution of the NGOs. At the end of the year, Girke told me, he attended a meeting in Rome with the Italian coastguard, to discuss how they could improve cooperation. “They were asking us to come back next year with bigger ships,” he said.', 'In the spring of 2017, six months after Gallo and his colleagues visited the police in Trapani, the prominent opposition politician Salvini made a startling claim on the TV talkshow In mezz’ora (“In half an hour”). In a heated debate with a representative of MSF, Salvini stated that he had seen a dossier by Italy’s secret services about contact between people smugglers and some of the NGOs. “There are weapons and drugs onboard some of those ships,” he added.', '“How do you know?” asked the presenter, clearly taken aback.', '“I listen to the people who work on these boats,” Salvini replied.', 'No more details of the “phantom dossier”, as one media outlet described it, ever emerged. But Salvini had been in contact with the security guards on board the Vos Hestia. According to Gallo, in September 2016, the trio emailed AISE, the Italian secret service, with their suspicions about the Iuventa. When nobody there responded, said Gallo, they tried Salvini.', '“[Salvini] called back a few minutes later,” Gallo told the newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano last year. “He wanted to meet us immediately, but we explained that we were about to embark, so he gave us the number of one of his contacts.” According to Gallo, Salvini asked them to secretly document what they saw at sea, and pass the information on to his office via an intermediary.', 'Salvini has only partially confirmed the account, telling Il Fatto Quotidiano that he “disseminated” some “highly interesting” information he received from one of Gallo’s colleagues. What we do know, however, is that in the early months of 2017, Salvini transformed the fortunes of the party he leads, the Lega Nord, by helping bring the claim that NGO rescuers were collaborating with smugglers from the far-right fringe into the mainstream of political debate.', 'The situation in the Mediterranean had become a rallying point for far-right activists across Europe. In December 2016, the Gefira Foundation, an obscure Dutch thinktank that purports to monitor the “extinction” of Europe’s “indigenous peoples”, published a report in which it claimed that search and rescue was a “scam” in which “NGOs, smugglers, the mafia, in cahoots with the European Union, have shipped thousands of illegals into Europe under the pretext of rescuing people”. Within weeks, similar claims then began to circulate among far-right social media accounts.', 'The narrative entered Italian politics, too. In February 2017, a Sicilian prosecutor called Carmelo Zuccaro announced a taskforce to investigate the NGOs, later claiming that smugglers and rescuers were colluding in order to destabilise the Italian economy. The following month, a hitherto unknown blogger, a 23-year-old media and communications student from Turin called Luca Donadel, posted a video to his Facebook page titled “the truth about migrants”, which argued that NGOs were running a “taxi service” for financial gain. Within days, Donadel’s video went viral, shared by Salvini on his own social media accounts, and discussed on Striscia la notizia, a popular satirical TV show. Italy’s other main opposition party, the Five Star Movement, joined the fray, and by April the accusation that the NGOs were “sea taxis” – a phrase coined by the Five Star Movement’s then leader, Luigi Di Maio, dominated the airwaves.', 'As the moral panic intensified, state surveillance of the Iuventa stepped up a gear. In May, the ship was twice ordered to leave the rescue zone near Libya and dock at Lampedusa. Beigui, Girke and Simon now think that this is when the ship’s bridge was bugged, although at the time they had no idea. “Maybe it was a bit naive,” said Simon, “but we were thinking like: ‘Come on, we are rescuing people from drowning, what’s the worst that could happen?’”', 'Italy’s government, under pressure from both its domestic opposition and other European states to reduce migration, was turning against the rescuers. Marco Minniti, a former political head of the intelligence services, had taken over as interior minister at the end of 2016. Unlike his predecessors, Minniti was convinced that the priority was to prevent migrants from leaving Libya. He struck deals with several of the armed groups that controlled Libya, offering training to what remained of the country’s coastguard – and negotiating with the militias that controlled smuggling in the coastal cities, to put a halt to migration.', 'As summer 2017 approached, however, the numbers leaving Libya reached a new record. At the end of June, Minniti had a flight to Washington DC turned around when he heard the news that 12,000 people, rescued from the Mediterranean in the space of a few days, were making their way to Italian ports. After an emergency summit, in which Italian officials briefed the media that NGOs were to blame for encouraging people smugglers, Minniti unveiled a tough new code of conduct for rescue vessels. It included the demand that boats bring rescued migrants directly to port rather than transferring them to larger ships, a condition that would have severely limited the operations of smaller vessels like the Iuventa. Several NGOs, including Jugend Rettet, refused to sign the document in its original form; MSF said the code would lead to “more drownings”.', 'By mid-August, it seemed as though Minniti’s agreements in Libya were finally taking effect. The number of people crossing the Mediterranean fell drastically. But as lurid details from the Iuventa case file spread throughout the media, the NGOs were now the centre of attention. “The NGOs don’t give a toss about migrants, it’s just the business opportunity of the moment,” said “Lucio M”, one of the security guards who worked with Gallo on board the Vos Hestia', 'A wide section of Italian society, and most of its politicians, had come to see the rescuers as a threat. Donations to the aid organisations plummeted, and in the second half of 2017 several of the major operators, including Save the Children and MSF, suspended or halted their rescue missions. Anti-immigration sentiment continued to rise – and by the autumn, even Pope Francis, a vocal supporter of migrants’ rights and humanitarian rescue, appeared to give ground. In September, he stated that it was understandable for “a country which has done so much, like Italy, to ask itself: can I host everyone? Do I have enough space?”', 'As a general election approached in early 2018, opposition politicians continued to attack the government on migration, with Salvini leading the charge. Support for the Lega soared: as recently as 2014 the party was supported by just 6% of the population; in 2018 it received 17%. The rightwing electoral alliance it formed part of topped the poll, with 37% of the vote. Entering coalition with the Five Star Movement, Salvini was appointed interior minister.', 'One idea – that saving people from drowning only encourages others to make the journey – has come to dominate Europe’s response to migration across the Mediterranean. Depending on your point of view, this is either hard-headed realism – or a terrifying, inhumane calculation. But the debate that surrounds this issue almost always obscures the perspectives of the people who attempt the journey.', 'In October 2016, at around the same time that Gallo and his colleagues were talking to detectives in Trapani, a young man from Gambia called Malik saw what he calls “a miracle out of nowhere”. The 20-year-old was crammed with 130 others into a dinghy launched that morning from Libya, the weather had turned rough and the dinghy was starting to sink. As people around him said their prayers and prepared for death, Malik spotted a ship on the horizon. Taking a white shirt from a fellow passenger, he stood up and waved it furiously.', '“They told us to stay calm, that we’d all be rescued,” said Malik when I spoke to him recently. “They gave us life vests and towed our boat all the way to the ship, and we got out one by one.” Malik, who left his home in Gambia in 2014 after his father stabbed him during a drunken argument, was one of two people rescued by the Iuventa who I tracked down earlier this year. His journey to the Mediterranean had been brutal. He had borrowed money to pay for his passage across the Sahara desert, then worked on building sites in Libya, hoping to save up enough money for a journey to Europe. But he was kidnapped and held for ransom by one smuggling gang, then detained by another in a camp near the coast for seven months until his mother sent him money to buy his way out.', 'Abdulrahman, who left his home in Sierra Leone during an outbreak of Ebola and was just 16 when he was saved from a waterlogged dinghy in August 2016, had a similar story. He told me that by the time he left Libya, he was so desperate that he had spent five days hiding among trees and scavenging for food outside the port of Sabratha, looking for a way to sneak into the camp where smugglers were sending boats out to sea. “In Libya, trust me, there is slavery there – they treat people like animals,” he said.', 'The widespread abuse of migrants in Libya, above all of people from sub-Saharan Africa, goes back at least two decades: in 2005, an Italian parliamentary commission heard that people were being locked up “like dogs” in detention centres built by Gaddafi, partly as a result of requests from European governments to limit migration to their shores. Gaddafi is gone, but there is still a well-documented overlap between smugglers and officials in what remains of the Libyan state.', 'As Maria Serrano, a migration researcher for Amnesty, put it to me: “NGOs don’t only save lives at sea, they monitor what is happening, and what the Iuventa and others were doing was bearing witness to the awful violations in Libya by trying to assist the survivors.”', 'In June 2018, Italian prosecutors officially named 10 Iuventa crew members as suspects. In an attempt to clear their name, the volunteers commissioned an investigation by the London-based researchers Forensic Architecture. Using geolocation techniques, and the Iuventa’s own archive of pictures and video footage, Forensic Architecture discovered what they say are serious discrepancies in the case file. In one instance, from June 2017, Italian authorities say an empty dinghy was being towed by Iuventa crew members back towards Libya. But analysis of video footage shot from another rescue ship, along with wind patterns, suggests that it was being towed in the opposite direction, the crew say in order to be destroyed. In another, from the same day, footage examined by Forensic Architecture suggests that two men seen watching a rescue take place from a distance are “engine fishers” – people who follow migrant boats in order to salvage the parts – rather than smugglers, as the authorities claim.', 'By this time, NGO rescuers had almost completely vanished from the central Mediterranean. Once in his post as interior minister, Salvini engineered a series of standoffs in which he prevented rescue ships from docking in Italy, leaving vessels with hundreds of migrants on board trapped at sea for days. “These jackals put the lives of immigrants at risk,” Salvini tweeted during one such episode. “Will they also go unpunished?” Now back in opposition, after his governing coalition collapsed last year, Salvini is facing a possible criminal trial of his own. This February, the Italian senate voted to strip him of parliamentary immunity and allow magistrates in Sicily to try him for kidnapping, over an incident in which he prevented 131 migrants from disembarking.', 'According to Matteo Villa, a migration researcher at the Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI), a leading Italian thinktank, Salvini’s actions may have been extreme, but he was “expressing the sentiments of all EU governments at the time”. An internal report by the EU border agency Frontex, leaked to the media in December 2016, stated that NGO rescuers acted as an unwitting “pull factor” on migration across the Mediterranean sea.', 'Yet Villa’s own research suggests this is a mistaken premise. A recent study of migration patterns from Libya between 2014 and 2019, co-authored with Eugenio Cusumano and published by the European University Institute, found “no relationship between the presence of NGOs at sea and the number of migrants leaving Libyan shores”. Instead, departures rose or fell with the weather, or due to political conditions in Libya itself. But in the absence of larger-scale rescue operations, the proportion of people who die has increased. Even though the number of crossings has fallen drastically, still 750 people drowned or went missing last year.', 'When I spoke to Malik and Abdulrahman, it was almost four years since they had encountered the Iuventa. Abdulrahman now lives in Germany, where his claim for asylum was granted, and is doing an engineering apprenticeship. “I was very angry to hear that the people who saved our lives are now having problems,” he told me. Malik, meanwhile, is living in a reception centre near Naples, still waiting for a decision on his asylum claim. “I knew what was happening in the Mediterranean and I made a gamble out of it,” he said. Abdulrahman and Malik’s fortunes had diverged – but they were both alive.', 'Last year, Pietro Gallo, the security guard whose actions helped trigger the surveillance of the Iuventa, broke his silence about the affair. “I never witnessed the NGOs collaborating with traffickers,” he told a reporter from the German newspaper Die Zeit. “That was always just a hunch. We put two and two together.” Gallo claimed he hadn’t intended for rescuers to be forced out of the Mediterranean, only that he thought Salvini would use his position “to work out a humanitarian solution on a European level”.', 'In late 2019, a resolution calling for the EU to improve its search-and-rescue operations was narrowly defeated in the European parliament by an alliance of far-right and conservative parties. Ursula von der Leyen, the centre-right president of the European commission – the EU’s executive branch – has promised a “human and humane” approach in the commission’s new migration pact, a document that will set the course of policy over the next few years. But Von der Leyen began her tenure last year by renaming her head of migration “commissioner for protecting the European way of life”, wording that was condemned for its resemblance to far-right propaganda, and quickly changed.', 'At the EU’s land and sea borders, reports describe the violent expulsion of refugees and other vulnerable migrants: this summer, Greece was accused of setting people adrift in the Aegean, while Italy and Malta have both tried to close their ports to rescued migrants, citing the coronavirus pandemic. It’s the migrants who most often get caught at the sharp end, but as governments toughen their border policies, volunteers who step in to help can find themselves treated as criminals. A recent report by Amnesty International found that since 2015, more than 150 people have been investigated or prosecuted in Europe for offering help to migrants.', 'In Italy, since the spring of 2017, 16 separate criminal investigations have been opened into NGO rescue ships. Today, the handful of NGOs that still operate face long battles with the authorities to be allowed into port, and their vessels are still sometimes impounded: on 21 September, a ship belonging to the German NGO Sea-Watch was held in the port of Palermo, for issues including “having too many lifejackets on board”, the fifth time a rescue vessel has been seized.', 'Yet none of the criminal cases have so far come to trial – even though, in the case of the Iuventa, which is now the longest-running active investigation, it has been more than three years since the ship was seized. Prosecutors have yet to decide whether they will bring charges, pending the result of a forensic search of the crew’s computers and phones. In the meantime, the Iuventa 10 are patiently trying to clear their name – and get their ship back.', '“We never thought we were a solution to the problem,” Girke told me when I spoke to him earlier this year. “The question for us was: how can we empower people on the move to resist, to end their own suffering?

The demonstrators are calling on the government to instead invest in expanding rail transport infrastructure.', 'As forestry workers began to fell the first trees on Thursday to make way for the motorway, police destroyed barricades, treehouses and makeshift platforms built by activists, who have been occupying parts of the forest for the last year.', 'On Friday, police said they had made 16 arrests in the adjacent Herrenwald where the clearing began, including 10 activists who had to be pulled down from treetops via hoisting platforms. In a video posted on social media, masked activists conceded that “we have sadly failed to stop the clearing, because there were too few of us”.', 'But protests have since proliferated, with activists temporarily occupying the Hessian state representation’s offices in Berlin on Friday, and about 300 cyclists closing down a section of the south-bound lane of the A49 on Saturday.', 'Organisers said about 5,000 people travelled to the forest on Sunday morning to protest against the motorway plans and to take part in “guided nature walks” through the threatened woodland.

That is how Janet Alty will always remember one of the most successful environment campaigns of modern times: the movement to ban lead in petrol.', 'There were the leaflets she wrote to warn parents at school gates of the dangers, leaflets to persuade voters and politicians, leaflets to drown out the industry voices saying – falsely – there was nothing to worry about.', 'In the late 1970s, the UK was still poisoning the air with the deadly toxin, despite clear scientific evidence that breathing in lead-tainted air from car exhausts had an effect on development and intelligence. Recently returned from several years in the US, Alty was appalled. Lead had been phased out in the US from 1975. Why was the British government still subjecting children to clear harm?', 'Robin Russell-Jones asked the same question. A junior doctor, he quickly grasped the nature of the lead problem, moving his family out of London. His fellow campaigner, Robert Stephens, amassed a trove of thousands of scientific papers, keeping them in his garage when his office burned down – he suspected foul play.', 'Their campaign took years. But in 1983, a damning verdict from the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution prompted the UK government to decree that both petrol stations and manufacturers must offer lead-free alternatives. Leaded petrol was finally removed from the last petrol pumps in the UK in 1999.', 'Today, it seems incredible that lead was ever used as a performance improver in car engines. Clean alternatives were available by the 1970s, but making the transition incurred short-term costs, so the motor industry, led by chemicals companies, clung on, lobbying politicians and ridiculing activists.', 'Faced with multiplying, and interlinked, environmental crises in the 2020s – the climate emergency, the sixth extinction stalking the natural world, the plastic scourge in our oceans, the polluted air of teeming metropolises – it is easy to feel overwhelmed. Lockdown offered a tantalising glimpse of a cleaner world, but also revealed a starker truth: that the global economy is not set up to prioritise wellbeing, climate and nature. What can we do, in the face of these devastating odds?', 'It is easy to forget that environmentalism is arguably the most successful citizens’ mass movement there has been. Working sometimes globally, at other times staying intensely local, activists have transformed the modern world in ways we now take for granted. The ozone hole has shrunk. Whales, if not saved, at least enjoy a moratorium on hunting. Acid rain is no longer the scourge of forests and lakes. Rivers thick with pollution in the 1960s teem with fish. Who remembers that less than 30 years ago, nuclear tests were still taking place in the Pacific? Greenpeace’s Rainbow Warrior ship was blown up by the French government in 1985, with one death and many injuries, in a long-running protest.', 'As well as giving heart to activists now, these victories contain important lessons. “The environmental movement has been very successful,” says Joanna Watson, who has worked at Friends of the Earth for three decades. “We’ve had so many campaigns and wins. Sometimes it’s been hard to claim success, and sometimes it takes a long time. And sometimes things that worked before won’t work now. But there’s a lot we can learn.”', 'Acid rain, first identified in the 1850s, took decades to address. The first murmurings of concern came about after the second world war and there were concerted efforts to solve it in the 1960s. But it is the campaign that Nat Keohane, vice-president at the Environmental Defense Fund and a former lecturer at Yale, points to when he wants to invoke the success of the global environmental movement. “The reason I talk about acid rain is that it’s one of the instances where we solved the problem.”', 'Acid rain occurs when sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides react with moist air to form weak acids, which then fall from clouds, killing plants and aquatic life. The scars can still be seen in parts of the US and northern Europe, where acid has etched limestone building facades, and faces have dissolved from statues. But in most of the world – except China, where the problem persists – the lifeless lakes and leafless trees that acid rain created have long since revived.', '“Environmental groups led a drumbeat of campaigning on acid rain throughout the 1980s,” says Keohane.', 'Public pressure in the worst-offending countries – chiefly the US and the UK, which were responsible for acid rain that fell largely on neighbouring countries such as Canada and Scandinavia – was key. Watson recalls one telling advertising campaign: posters printed on litmus paper that said: “When acid rain is falling, you should see red” – offering a vivid illustration of the problem.', 'Getting businesses onside was a different matter. In the US, that was achieved through a novel mechanism that offered financial incentives from rivals, rather than the public purse. “It was the first successful demonstration of a market-based approach,” says Keohane. US power plant operators were issued with a limited number of allowances for how much sulphur and nitrogen oxides they could emit. They could buy and sell these among themselves, meaning the dirtiest companies had to buy them from those who cleaned up fastest, while the number of allowances available was gradually reduced. This cap-and-trade system operated successfully from 1990, becoming the model for a similar approach to greenhouse gases under the 1997 Kyoto protocol – though that attempt was less successful, because the US rejected it.', '', 'Net-zero carbon\xa0or\xa0carbon neutrality\xa0mean that the emissions of an entity (such as a country, region or company) are balanced by the amount of carbon dioxide it is taking out of the atmosphere, through absorption (eg trees) or removal (ie carbon\xa0capture and storage, see below)', 'Carbon removal\xa0is the process of taking carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases out of the air chemically or mechanically. This can be done at source, by capturing and containing carbon dioxide or other gases physically, or by\xa0“scrubbing”, a chemical process applied to waste gases that flow or are pushed through a filter that react with the gases to change them to less harmful forms. It can also be achieved, usually less efficiently, by scrubbing carbon from ambient air. There are various methods of doing this, most involving passing air over chemical filters, but at its simplest carbon removal can take the form of crushing rocks such as basalt that then absorb carbon naturally from the air, a process known as enhanced weathering. These crushed rocks can be added to soil, which can also improve the fertility of poor soils, but the energy used to crush the rocks must also be taken into account.', 'Carbon capture and storage (CCS)\xa0is a means of carbon removal that requires diverting carbon dioxide emissions from their source, usually a power station or industrial facility, and compressing the gas to a liquid for long-term storage, usually in a depleted oil well or other natural geological storage site. CCS technology has progressed over the past two decades but is still expensive and energy-intensive.', 'Carbon offsetting\xa0is the practice of reaching carbon neutrality through investing in projects that reduce CO2 emissions. There are as many forms of offsetting as there are ways of using energy. Carbon sinks such as forests and peatlands can be protected or expanded to offset carbon emissions from other sources. Tree-planting, for instance, is a common offsetting practice. Carbon offsetting has been sometimes controversial in the past two decades, as it has been subject to scams and frauds, and because some organisations have been accused of using offsetting as a cheap alternative to more difficult choices involved in reducing their emissions. For these reasons, it is important that offsetting measures are clearly set out and subject to independent verification.', '“The benefits were 40 times greater than the costs,” says Keohane. “There was an 86% reduction in pollutants, from 1990 to 2015, and there were huge unappreciated benefits beyond acid rain, on cleaning up particulates [an especially harmful form of air pollution].”', 'What acid rain showed is that businesses can be successfully regulated, without causing economic damage, says Keohane. As with the campaign against lead, companies resisted new rules for years, but when they came, they responded swiftly, showing governments they could afford to be less timid.', 'There are also lessons for today’s campaigners in the close shaves. Climate change threatens to melt the ice caps, raise sea levels, destroy agriculture over swaths of the world, and is already causing humanitarian disasters. Time is short. But a lesson from 40 years ago shows the world can move quickly and decisively if it has to.', 'About 15-35km above the surface of the Earth, the ozone layer acts as a filter against the sun’s radiation, blocking about 97% to 99% of medium-frequency ultraviolet light. That is important, because over-exposure to ultraviolet radiation is harmful to most living things, including plants and animals, and causes skin cancers, eye problems and genetic damage in humans.', 'In 1974 came the first indications that all was not well in the lower stratosphere. Research by Mario Molina, who died last week, and F Sherwood Rowland, both later awarded Nobel prizes, found that chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), commonly used as propellants in aerosols, were likely to be reacting with the ozone and depleting it.', 'The first moves against CFCs were in the US, Canada, Sweden and a few other countries in 1978, but others hung back, as chemical companies dismissed the fears as theoretical. Then, in 1985, the British Antarctic Survey published clear evidence of damage, in the form of a patch of drastically thinned ozone across the south pole. Their measurements showed 40% less ozone than had been detected 20 years earlier. The science was indisputable.', 'The world moved quickly. Governments got together under the aegis of the UN and forged the Montreal Protocol in 1987, which phased out ozone-depleting chemicals globally. “The Montreal protocol is the best environment treaty the world has ever created,” says Durwood Zaelke, the president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development. “It solved the first great threat to the atmosphere, and put the ozone layer on the path to recovery by 2065. There’s very strong empirical evidence that it has done its job.”', 'When the Montreal protocol was signed, the world was rapidly approaching a precipice. The further the ozone depleted, the less likely it was to regenerate naturally. If the damage continued beyond a certain point, recovery and natural repair would have become virtually impossible, even if production of the harmful chemicals ceased. “It would have been beyond repair in about five or 10 years if we had not acted,” says Paul Bledsoe, a strategic adviser at the Progressive Policy Institute thinktank in Washington DC.', 'The Montreal protocol shows, as the response to Covid-19 demonstrated, that the world can move quickly when governments want to.', '“If a government needs to act, and Covid has shown this, my God can a government act,” says John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK. “All of a sudden, no regulation, no amount of money is a problem. When we need to act, we can.”', 'A key factor in the Montreal protocol and its preceding successes was making the economic case for action. When it came to ozone-depleting chemicals, the chemical companies found they could manufacture substitutes – and make more money doing so. Car companies made a similar calculation on lead in petrol, and US power plants had the incentives of cap-and-trade to halt acid rain. Today, a comparable economic shift has already happened in the field of climate action: renewable energy is cheaper in many countries than coal, gas and oil, and costs are likely to fall further.', 'But some companies with fossil fuels to sell will still be left stranded, and corporate vested interests have not gone away. Russell-Jones recalls that Associated Octel, the UK’s main lead producer, “went apoplectic” when he started touring radio studios in the early 1980s, sending an operative to trail him in a car, following him in to demand right of reply on the same programme he had just appeared on. These days, there is no need for such efforts as internet trolls can reach far more people.', '“Fake news is everywhere,” he says. “Disinformation from rightwing thinktanks, on air pollution and climate change, is all over the internet. And the media landscape has shifted to the right.”', 'One of the most striking aspects of successful environmental campaigns of the past is how they straddled the left-right political divide. Key green legislation and decisions, including the Montreal protocol and the 1992 UN framework convention on climate change, the parent treaty to the Paris agreement, were put forward and signed by leaders from across the political spectrum.', 'This may be partly because world leaders in the past were more willing to listen to scientists than today. “[The UK prime minister, Margaret] Thatcher got it, on the ozone layer – she was a chemist, she read all the scientific papers herself,” says Zaelke. “[Ronald] Reagan got it because he’d had skin cancer.”', 'But a changing political discourse in many countries, driven by a rightwing populism that has forsaken reality in favour of stoking imagined grievances, has created a harsher political environment, according to Bledsoe. “The opponents [of climate action] have learned that in a culture where people get their news from politically dominated outlets [and the internet], they can get away with lying about almost anything.” But he says there is one bright spot: “Younger people are rejecting these lies about climate change.”', 'In building a consensus that can transcend political divisions, Keohane believes green campaigners must focus on the outcome rather than the process and bring forward constructive ideas. “People get used to thinking about the fight, not the winning.” he says. “We have to remind ourselves that we have done it and we can do it again.”', 'Reaching out across divisions to foster a broad and inclusive sense of community is essential. Alty may have spent seemingly endless hours printing and handing out leaflets, but “I never felt lonely, not once,” she says, and the many positive responses from people she encountered kept her going. “It was very labour-intensive, it was like rolling a heavy boulder up a very steep hill.

Greenhouse gas emissions, heatwaves, wildfires, melting polar ice, floods, droughts, the annihilation of wildlife, air pollution … the problems grow more severe every year.', 'Of course, 2020 has been dominated by the coronavirus pandemic, but even here the correlation with environmental destruction is clear.', 'The “tip of the iceberg” – that was the warning early in the year, when we reported that many more viruses were present in wildlife and just waiting to be released by the human destruction of nature. The UN’s environment chief said “nature is sending us a message” that our abuse of the planet had consequences.', 'As critical as it is to tackle the damage caused by Covid-19, the root cause – the invasion of wild places and the exploitation of wild animals – is not being addressed, experts warned in the Guardian, despite the relatively tiny amount it would cost. Without action, even worse pandemics would happen, top scientists warned.', 'The cascade of pandemic impacts is also hitting food supplies in vulnerable places, with the Guardian highlighting fears of the worst food crisis in 50 years and a “famine of biblical proportions”. We also revealed how meat processing plants had become hotspots of Covid-19 infections among workers: “Everyone’s on top of you, sneezing and coughing,” one person told us.', 'While a temporary reduction in air pollution was a rare benefit of the pandemic, long-term exposure to dirty air appears to drive up Covid infections and deaths. The Guardian revealed the latest research, including a striking study providing compelling evidence of a link, as well as the discovery of the virus on pollution particle samples. Poor quality air might also help explain the disproportionate impact of Covid on minority ethnic communities, we revealed.', 'The coronavirus crisis is also an opportunity, however, with trillions of dollars being deployed to fund the recovery. In-depth series in both the UK and Australia set out how this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to put the world on track to tackle the climate crisis, transforming energy, transport, food and even aviation.', 'Of course, fossil fuel vested interests remain, and the Guardian exposed their lobbying for cash in the US, Australia and around the world. We also took a road trip around the UK to seek the views of ordinary people on the Covid recovery. The conclusion: few want a return to “normal”.', 'That normal would mean the relentless rise of global heating, with the brief cut in emissions during lockdown no more than a blip. Nowhere is that heating more obvious than in the oceans. In January, the Guardian’s print edition led its front page with the news of a record high ocean temperature in 2019, showing the “irrefutable and accelerating” heating of the planet.', 'The danger signs kept coming, and we kept reporting them, from the temperature in the Antarctic rising above 20C for the first time on record, to deforestation in the Amazon hitting its highest level in a decade.', 'One of the principal duties of the Guardian is to hold power to account. Our landmark series, The Polluters, revealed the 20 fossil fuel companies whose exploitation of oil, gas and coal reserves had caused more than one-third of all carbon emissions in the modern era, as well as Google’s funding of climate change deniers and the power of the car lobby.', 'In the US, the 100 days countdown series to the US withdrawal from the 2015 Paris agreement showed how the global climate fight could be lost if Donald Trump is re-elected and how worsening heatwaves are exacerbating systemic racial inequalities.', 'In Australia, the Guardian ran an agenda-setting interactive series, The Frontline, laying bare the climate emergency in the country. The starkest illustration were the devastating bushfires that raged through the summer months and were documented in The Summer of Dread and After the Bushfires projects. Amid all this, we revealed the third mass bleaching event on the Great Barrier reef in five years.', 'In fighting the climate crisis, the power of protest has become a mighty force in the last two years. We have championed the protesters, being at the UN in New York for Greta Thunberg’s emotional condemnation of world leaders, and exploring in depth the rise of Extinction Rebellion and how it can reinvent itself for a post-pandemic world. We also revealed that a quarter of all tweets about the climate crisis came from bots that amplified denialist messages.', 'Like the climate emergency, the annihilation of wildlife that threatens the air, water and food on which we depend has not gone away, and neither has the Guardian’s coverage of the crisis. In our Age of Extinction series we examined the deadly truth behind almond milk – “it’s like sending bees to war” – and, like all Guardian exclusives, this was followed up widely by other media.', 'We also revealed the $1m-a-minute farming subsidies that are ravaging the natural world and the mysterious mass die-off of hundreds of elephants in Botswana, and dug into the UK’s high-speed rail project’s impact on biodiversity and climate change.', 'The largest environmental cause of human disease and death in the world today is pollution, responsible for many millions of premature deaths. We have kept a sharp focus on this, revealing, for example, research linking air pollution to brain cancer for the first time.', 'Pollution takes many forms and we have reported in depth on the “cancer town” in the US where the risk of the disease is 50 times above the national average, and revealed that microplastic pollution is raining down on city dwellers, with as yet unknown effects on lung health.', 'Rivers have long suffered from pollution but we revealed the startling fact that water companies discharged raw sewage into English rivers more than 200,000 times in 2019. The only thing worse than dirty water is no water, and we exposed the scandal of millions of US citizens being unable to afford water bills.', 'While hard-hitting news is at the Guardian’s core, some stories need space to tell, such as our journey to Antarctica where we encountered the surprising sound of icebergs melting, and our long read on the career of the world’s most revered naturalist, Sir David Attenborough. Another extraordinary tale was that of Takaya, the lone sea wolf whose spirit captured worldwide attention.', 'We also know that finding solutions is vital in tackling the environmental challenges facing the world, which is why we reported from Darfur on how a water project was helping to end the “first climate change war” and how scientists created a mutant bacterial enzyme that broke down plastic bottles for recycling in hours.', 'In the UK, the good news included the benefits of beavers, which now have a permanent home in Devon as well as Scotland, and plans to rewild a large patch of East Anglia and to bring back wild bison for the first time in 6,000 years.', 'The Guardian’s commitment to environmental reporting has real world impacts, but these are rarely easy to measure. So it is useful to hear from those at the top.', 'Christiana Figueres, the UN’s climate chief when the Paris deal was sealed in 2015, said: “Without the work of the Guardian the delivery of the Paris agreement would have been far harder or perhaps even impossible. Its role has continued to be essential in the years since as the situation has become more urgent on a host of issues including climate change and biodiversity. At a time when the darkness of fake news and doubt in science is everywhere, the Guardian is a point of light.”', 'Bill McKibben, the leading climate writer and campaigner, said: “There is nothing in the English-language press that comes close to matching the scope and the commitment of the Guardian’s coverage of climate change. At this point, the climate change fight resembles nothing so much as a war. War reporting is the place where newspapers have traditionally shined, bringing all their resources to bear.

But Amazon said the new scheme will help lessen the company’s impact on the environment.', 'The products, badged with a special logo from at least one of 18 independent certification schemes, are featured in a dedicated section of the website and shown in shopping results, with extra sustainability information on the product page. They include goods made and sold by small businesses across Europe, including – in the UK – Manchester-based Faith in Nature, which makes plastic-free shampoo bars, and Kite Clothing in Poole, Dorset, known for its sustainable children’s clothes.', 'Amazon has also created its own externally validated certification, Compact by Design, to encourage brands to design products that can reduce carbon emissions through increased efficiency and better packaging. Among those already certified is the Cif ecorefill, a concentrated cleaning spray refill that helps people reuse their spray bottles.', 'The platform was launched in the US in September and is being rolled out this week to the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. It supports Amazon’s wider commitment to reach the Paris Agreement 10 years early and be at net zero carbon by 2040.', 'However, environmental campaigners pointed out that 40,000 badged products was “a tip of the iceberg” of the millions it ships within Europe every year. It is thought that Amazon ships between 4bn and 5bn parcels a year worldwide. One of the world’s largest logistics operators, the retailer has been a major beneficiary of the Covid-19 pandemic as homebound shoppers have turned to online shopping, accelerating the collapse of already struggling bricks-and-mortar rivals.', 'Will McCallum, senior campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “Amazon sells millions of products and this latest initiative covers just a tiny fraction of the total. By certifying only a limited range of goods, Amazon is implicitly admitting that the rest of its business model isn’t up to scratch. The environmental and climate crises we are facing demand more than token gestures and piecemeal action.”', 'Doug Gurr, Amazon UK manager, said the new platform will help customers discover more sustainable products. “With 18 external certification programmes and our own new certification, we’re incentivising selling partners to create sustainable products that help protect the planet for future generations,” he said.', 'Friends of the Earth’s head of policy, Mike Childs, welcomed the initiative as “a small step in the right direction” but said the company had a long journey ahead of it before it could be considered green. “Will greener products appear higher in searches?
