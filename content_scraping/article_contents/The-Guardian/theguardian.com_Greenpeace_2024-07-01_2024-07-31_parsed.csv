I’d even go so far as to say I hate it. When mentioning this to a friend, she reminds me that when we were nine, I would loudly proclaim across the primary school cafeteria that I was “very passionate about Gordon Brown”! Labour is in power for the first time since I was 10 years old, but I hardly feel thrilled. In fact, I don’t feel engaged at all. Whatever fervour Gordon Brown inflamed in my nine-year-old heart has been snuffed out over the last 14 years.', 'I am not the only one to lose faith. Among my friends there was a lot of apathy towards the election. My “snowflake” generation is often accused in the media of being a “woke brigade” that cares too much about appearances and trends, with little interest in formal politics. We are seen as suffering from a lack of knowledge or gumption, inept in our methods, participating only by reposting infographics.', 'But this disinterest in electoral politics is hardly surprising when we have seen how little change it can make to our lives, having only witnessed the steady decline of Westminster from an already dysfunctional establishment into a hollow crown. Many older people have become jaded with politics over the past decade and a half. Those of us in our mid-20s, however, have never had the chance to develop faith in the first place.', 'The last 14 years are a montage of Conservative prime ministers turning away from the podium outside No 10, leaving behind a bigger mess than the one they began with. The most obvious effect is that austerity is the only precedent my peers and I have ever known. It has caused chaos at every level, starting with destroying local government’s ability to provide services or generate its own funds and culminating in a feeling that all state structures in the UK are falling apart. I went to a good state school, but it had minimal catering for Send students, and some teachers were too overworked to produce lesson plans. Some lessons involved a student reading aloud to the class while our teacher caught up with the admin. My school was then made into an academy and detached from local government supervision. It subsequently dropped down a whole Ofsted ranking and joined the lower half-percentile for A-level results.', 'If the last 14 years have taught us anything, it’s that change – if it’s for the worse – is possible, and the numbers bear this out. There are now almost 3,000 food banks up from just a handful in 2010. And the average person is £10,000 poorer than they would have been if the economy had grown at pre-2010 trends. Who can blame us for the inability to imagine a better future? In 2008 12% of people thought the young would be worse off than their parents; now more than 40% of people believe this.', 'At the same time that all this was happening, our experience of national politics was often one of farce, prioritising spectacle over substance. Favourites included the lettuce that lasted longer than Liz Truss, and the Mound, an expensive lump of mud built next to Marble Arch to attract tourists. But this slapstick distracted from more sinister political decisions, such as the opportunism of MPs during Covid, or Sunak offering his “unequivocal support” to Netanyahu and Israeli security “not just today … but always”. Always, even after 14,000 children have been killed. And let’s not forget that nothing has been done to alleviate the rental crisis or the climate emergency.', 'Instead of progress, all we’ve seen is politicians clowning around, fiddling with their staff or bullying them, subjecting themselves to absurd activities on TikTok, or simply stating outlandish and extreme things in order to be seen as “saying it how it is”. By betting on this election, MPs treated it like a horse race. And they’re right: it is sport, a public relations game, a back and forth between Westminster and the media where the only real product at the end of it all is content. How could anything consequential come out of such a pageant?', 'Of course, not all of these problems are unique to the UK. International politics hasn’t provided an anchor of hope or normalcy either. What I’ve seen of international affairs has been bleak. I was too young to vote in the Brexit referendum, was still a child when Trump became president, and #MeToo was at the forefront of my adolescence. The widespread failures to hit global goals on climate mitigation, the recent rise of the far right in Europe, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the genocide in Gaza have all contributed to a ubiquitous feeling that those in power do not have their citizens’ best interests at heart. A 2020 study found younger generations across the western world are “more dissatisfied with democratic performance than the old” and have “more discontent”. The researchers put it down to the “growing intergenerational divide in life opportunities”.', 'The most hopeful political events of my adult life have been at the grassroots level. The “stop Cambo” campaign forced Shell to pull out of a controversial oilfield project off the Shetland Islands, and there have been collective action campaigns against six water companies in the UK for failing to report sewage spills and pollution. It is brilliant that these actions happen, that private actors are held to account for their mismanagement and exploitation of former state assets, but grassroots activism doesn’t help to rebuild our state, or connect us to electoral politics.', 'Many younger people’s break with Labour over recent years has been based on its cowardly approach to Palestine, the environment and the economy, and a brutal stance on policing and trans rights. It seems that it offers no path away from the cycle of issues elections have been fixated on since 2010: immigration, the NHS crisis and taxes.', 'If Labour can’t create a feeling of optimism by instigating real change with actual policy rather than showcasing the same tired old spectacle, it won’t be able to interest people in formal politics. Without healing this rift, a Labour government will run its course without significant impact, continuing the trend of the last 14 years, and thereby laying the ground for something potentially even worse.', 'I catch myself being despondent and chide myself for it because I don’t think defeatism is helpful. I want to hope that things will get better. Labour has won, but the party has repeatedly told us what it will do: continue with austerity and short-termism, largely because there is no money. It’s doubtful Labour will conduct any radical restructuring of the state. This is a shame for many reasons, but is particularly frustrating for young people because this could be a great opportunity.

The most common form, pyrolysis, does so using heat.', 'Shell has invested in pyrolysis since 2019, touting it as a way to slash waste. That year, the company used oil made via pyrolysis in one of its Louisiana chemical plants for the first time. And it began publicizing a new goal for the technology: “Our ambition is to use 1m tonnes of plastic waste a year in our global chemicals plants by 2025.”', 'But recently, the company rolled back that promise with little fanfare: “[I]n 2023 we concluded that the scale of our ambition to turn 1m tonnes of plastic waste a year into pyrolysis oil by 2025 is unfeasible,” it said in its 2023 sustainability report, published in March.', 'Reached for comment, a Shell spokesperson, Curtis Smith, said: “Our ambition, regardless of regulation, is to increase circularity and move away from a linear economy to one where products and materials are reused, repurposed and recycled.”', 'The company has not called attention to this retraction, but it is a “significant” change, said Davis Allen, investigative researcher at the Center for Climate Integrity, which shared the finding with the Guardian.', '“It’s an acknowledgment that advanced recycling is not developing in the way that companies have promised it will, and are counting on it to,” he said. “That’s pretty meaningful.”', 'Researchers and environmental advocates have long raised concerns about advanced recycling, warning it can create even more toxic and planet-heating pollution than virgin plastic production and is even more energy intensive than traditional plastic recycling. Studies show the facilities are most likely to harm communities that are already vulnerable to contamination and climate threats.', 'But that is not why Shell struck its pledge. In the report, the company said the walk-back was necessary due to changes in the market.', '“While Shell sees customer demand for circular chemicals, the pace of growth globally is less than expected due to lack of available feedstock, slow technology development and regulatory uncertainty,” the document says.', 'Complaints of insufficient feedstock may seem a surprising when hundreds of millions of tons of plastic are produced each year. But despite what is suggested in marketing materials, post-consumer items such as food packaging and empty soap bottles cannot easily be recycled via pyrolysis. The process works best with clean, homogeneous inputs, but sorting and cleaning plastic is expensive. As a result, most chemical recycling facilities working at scale rely mostly on processed industrial scrap – or “plastic left on the cutting room floor during production”, said Allen.', 'Slow technology development has indeed been a factor in the advanced recycling market said Allen, but one that Shell “maybe should have seen coming”.', 'The industry has claimed pyrolysis will be a groundbreaking solution to plastic waste for many years; Allen recently found a lobby group document making such claims in the 1970s. But experts have also told the the sector for decades that there are practical issues with advanced recycling, the Center for Climate Integrity has found.', 'Today, there is mounting evidence that advanced recycling “often just does not work”, said Judith Enck, president of advocacy group Beyond Plastics and a former EPA regional administrator. Many of the United States’ 11 advanced recycling facilities operate only partially, and two have been shut down altogether.', 'Shell’s third reason for walking back their pledge – regulatory uncertainty – probably refers to a rapidly changing advanced recycling policy landscape. Many states have recently passed pro-advanced recycling legislation, due largely to lobbying by the powerful industry group the American Chemistry Council, said Enck.', 'But some regulators are moving in the other direction. The Environmental Protection Agency last year withdrew a plan to ease some regulations on pyrolysis, while New Jersey recently decided chemically recycled material should not be considered recycled plastic.', 'Other plastic producers, such as Exxon and Dow, have also pledged to rapidly expand their advanced recycling capacities. The technology can bring forth a “circular” plastics economy that reduces the need to use virgin fossil fuels, the industry often claims.', '“The commitments have tied into a broader strategy to push advanced recycling as an answer to all of the public’s concerns about plastic waste,” said Allen. “It lets them say, ‘it won’t matter that we’re producing [several times] the amount of plastic that we’re producing now in several decades, because it will all be circular.”', 'Though it has reversed this advanced recycling pledge, Shell does not appear to be backing away from its plans to expand plastic production. It recently opened a chemical complex as large as 300 football fields near Pittsburgh, with the capacity to produce 1.6m tons of plastic a year.', 'It is also still a member of the American Chemistry Council and its subgroup America’s Plastic Makers, which has recently been running an ad promoting advanced recycling which asks audiences to “imagine a future where plastic is not wasted, but instead remade over and over”.', 'Still, the retraction is a tacit acknowledgment of the longstanding issues with the technology, said Enck.', '“I have never said this before, but Shell has made a wise decision here,” she said. “Chemical recycling is a polluting and an unreliable way to address the growing problem of plastics.”']",['Dharna Noor'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27b386c94b4817e1cc8b2f0141b84b2b4253d4e5/0_0_5200_3467/master/5200.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'a silhouette of a factory next to water and an orange sky']]",

Norway already has more heat pumps per household than anywhere bar Japan, which uses them mainly for cooling. And by the end of the year Norwegian streets may become the first in the world on which electric vehicles outnumber combustion engine cars.', 'Analysts say the Norwegian public’s hunger for clean technologies – and their leaders’ willingness to back them early – has spurred global innovations that drive quality up and push prices down. The capital, Oslo, for instance, is the first public authority to set a target of zero-emissions construction sites, which it will mandate from the start of next year. The move has already encouraged manufacturers to bring electric construction machinery on to the market that can help decarbonise building sites around the world.', 'But even as Norway has championed the switch to a clean domestic economy, it appears to have bet that the rest of the world will not do the same. Its government continues to license fossil fuel extraction projects in the face of stern scientific warnings that there are already enough oil platforms, gas wells and coalmines to blow through the global carbon budget for 1.5C (2.7F). The International Energy Agency has sounded the alarm for the last three years that further fossil fuel exploration is not compatible with its scenarios for reaching net zero emissions by 2050, but to little avail.', 'The Norwegian defence is that its fossil fuels are produced more cleanly and with higher ethical standards than those of the autocracies and flawed democracies that dominate petroleum production. Climate activists counter that it is unfair of Norway, which has become extremely rich from its oil industry, to drill even more at the expense of poorer producers, who would effectively have to rein in their supply if the world is to have a chance of meeting its climate targets.', 'Elisabeth Sæther, the state secretary of Norway’s petroleum ministry, said the country was working to reduce its “already low” production emissions and phase out unabated fossil fuels globally – but that “the world will still need oil and gas”. She cited an analysis commissioned by the ministry that found an increase in Norwegian production could lower global emissions, though she cautioned that the uncertainties were large.', 'Activists have dismissed the argument that more oil could somehow be good for the climate as outlandish – fewer emissions, after all, means burning fewer fossil fuels.', 'But should Norway rein its production in, other producers will have an incentive to ramp theirs up. Studies estimate that for every 10 barrels of oil Norway stops producing, other suppliers will make six to nine more.', 'Norwegian economists have wrestled fiercely with the implications of these effects – with some arguing that a cut to production would still be effective and others suggesting it could increase emissions if the replacement fuels come from countries with dirtier production practices.', 'Sign up to Down to Earth', ""The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential"", 'after newsletter promotion', 'But while the global impact of Norway’s fossil fuel frenzy is hard to quantify, the effect at home is clear. Norway has cut its greenhouse gas emissions by just 11% since 1990 – four times less than coal-hungry and car-loving Germany – despite its roaring success at electrifying the economy and running it on renewables. The expansion of the oil and gas industry has been the biggest barrier to progress, and the task is growing harder as easy-to-access fields are used up.', 'Norway’s conundrum is also an economic one. One quarter of the country’s GDP comes from oil and gas but its biggest customer, the EU, promised in 2019 to become the world’s first climate-neutral continent – a feat that will entail slashing demand for fossil fuels hard and fast. No petroleum-producing country has yet charted a path for how to transition to a clean economy fairly, although neighbouring Denmark, which extracts far smaller amounts of oil and gas than Norway, became the first country to set an end date for production in 2020.', 'Norway has done “some very wise things” in managing its petroleum resources, said Erlend Hermansen at the Centre for International Climate Research in Oslo (Cicero), but it faces a hard landing if it does not plan for its decline. “How do you transform that business in a society that’s going to net zero? That’s the billion dollar question.”', 'In the short term, the answer appears to be that it will not. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine sent European lawmakers scrambling for gas suppliers, Norway had ramped up production.', '“The war changed everything,” said Frode Alfheim, the head of trade union Industri Energi. “The little uncertainty about the future of oil and gas has been prolonged for many decades. I feel sure that if you want to start working as an apprentice today, you’ll retire as an oil and gas worker.”', 'Norwegian gas has helped keep the lights on across Europe while reducing the need to burn dirty coal in German power plants or ship in liquefied natural gas that was fracked in the US. But by the same logic, it has also reduced the pressure on European leaders to invest in renewables, energy efficiency and demand reduction measures that the continent is failing to roll out fast enough.', 'One group of Norwegian researchers has argued that another global treaty akin to the Paris agreement is needed to address the inherent tension between supply and demand for fossil fuels in a globalised world. If only some countries restricted their fossil fuel demand, they wrote in the journal Science, global prices would fall, encouraging “free-riding countries” to consume more. And if only some countries restricted supply, prices would rise, encouraging other countries to produce more. “But by restricting their own fossil fuel supply as well as their demand, a coalition of the willing can eliminate global price changes that result from their policies,” they wrote.', 'So far, such ideas have made little headway in mainstream climate diplomacy. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance launched three years ago by Denmark and Costa Rica counts just a dozen sovereign states among its core members. An effort to create a fossil fuel nonproliferation treaty, spearheaded by Tuvalu and Vanuatu and endorsed by the World Health Organization and the European parliament, is supported by 13 governments, most of whom are small island states. Norway is a member of neither group.', 'In fact, Norway is expected to hand out 80 oil and gas licences this year, according to analysis from the International Institute for Sustainable Development and shared exclusively with the Guardian. It estimates this will result in 771m tonnes of pollution from greenhouse gases. The Norwegian petroleum ministry, which awarded 62 licenses last year, said it has not yet processed applications for this year and that it is working to reduce emissions by at least 55% by 2030.', 'Bård Lahn, a researcher at the University of Oslo who studies Norway’s fossil fuel policy, said: “Another perspective is that we are at a political impasse, where we need to reduce both supply and demand for fossil fuels, but it’s very hard for someone to take the first step.', '“We need someone to chart the course, show it’s possible and gain experience with it.

But the tide is turning', 'It is a delusion to believe that the world’s climate is being pushed to the brink solely by undemocratic petrostates such as Russia and Saudi Arabia. The truth is that about half of all planned oil and gas developments between now and 2050 will be sanctioned by wealthy governments that position themselves as climate leaders: the US, Canada, Australia, Norway and the UK.', 'It is the countries that like to think of themselves as the good guys that are driving the climate crisis – and not just because of historical emissions and the high-carbon lifestyles of our middle class. It is because our governments refuse to take one of the most obvious actions needed to stop the crisis: keeping oil and gas in the ground. As we have heard time and again, governments are planning to sanction vastly more oil and gas than can be burned in a world with a safe climate.', 'What explains this egregious state of affairs? The capture of our politics by the oil and gas industry is one explanation. We hear politicians repeating the industry’s talking points – “change will only come by driving down demand, not cutting off the supply” – knowing that the industry has fought tooth and nail to delay measures that would reduce demand for their product. They say that oil and gas profits are needed to fund the transition to clean energy, all the while knowing that oil and gas companies account for only 1% of clean energy investment globally. They point an accusing finger at oil- and gas producing-countries in the Gulf, while they continue to approve new oil and gas projects despite having highly diversified economies, driven by several other industries.', 'In Norway, the government is desperate to draw attention to the number of electric vehicles on its roads, but there is no distracting from its voracious appetite for oil and gas drilling. Its state-owned oil company, Equinor, is also pushing forward massive new projects in other countries, such as the Rosebank oilfield off the coast of Scotland (which my organisation, Uplift, is challenging in the courts alongside Greenpeace). All wealthy countries think they will produce the last barrel of oil, profiting until the very end.', 'Here in the UK, a movement has sprung up to loudly defend the public interest and weaken the power of the oil and gas industry. Supported by calls from scientists, health experts, MPs and even ex-oil and gas CEOs, this movement is challenging the dominance of the industry and its reheated arguments. It successfully halted the Cambo oilfield in 2021; framed the terms of the debate in Westminster and put pressure on politicians over new oil and gas licensing rounds; and is now focused on stopping the biggest undeveloped oilfield in the North Sea at Rosebank.', 'Rosebank is a compelling case study in the folly of new oil and gas production in the UK. It will produce oil for export that will do nothing to strengthen our energy security nor lower household bills; it will receive billions in tax breaks while the profits flow to the Norwegian government via Equinor; and the emissions from burning its reserves are the same as running 56 coal-fired power stations for a year.', 'But there are promising signs that the tide is turning. The flawed environmental calculus that enables governments to approve new oil and gas fields has recently been corrected by courts in the UK and Norway. Governments must now consider the emissions caused by burning the oil and gas extracted from fields when they assess a project’s environmental impacts, not just the much smaller emissions created by the extraction process. This is a crucial step towards a fairer, more transparent environmental governance. In the aftermath of the supreme court ruling in the UK, the government has dropped the defence to a legal challenge over the creation of a new coalmine in Whitehaven and reversed its decision to allow oil drilling in Lincolnshire.', 'Together with its commitment to end new exploration licensing, our new government is starting to grasp the urgent imperative to curb new production, as well as the huge opportunities presented by the transition to renewable energy. Unlocking these opportunities will require a properly funded and comprehensive just transition, and an industrial strategy designed with the interest of workers and ordinary people at its heart. But the reward for getting it right is thousands of good, long-term jobs; new sources of prosperity in parts of the country that need it most; and more affordable energy for all.

After 14 years in which the Conservative government ducked many of the big decisions, deliberately underfunded regulators, picked culture wars rather than formulated policy, and set out target after target without putting in place the measures needed to meet them, the UK is in a poor state on nearly all green fronts.', 'Here are the top green issues that Keir Starmer, as well as the energy security and net zero secretary, Ed Miliband, and the environment, food and rural affairs secretary, Steve Reed, will have in their in-trays.', 'Labour’s headline green pledge is to make the UK into a “clean energy superpower” by decarbonising electricity by 2030. Experts agree this will be at the furthest reaches of possibility – but even if Labour fails to meet the target entirely, getting a substantial way there will be a major achievement.', 'It will require boosting renewable energy: lifting the ban on onshore windfarms in England that has stymied this cheap form of energy, which Labour announced on Monday; boosting offshore wind when the next round of auctions comes up next month; greenlighting new solar farms; helping households to use less energy; and a programme to encourage businesses to step up their efficiency and adopt new processes.', 'Most of this is uncontroversial, though changes to the planning rules may be more difficult to put into practice than they were to put in a manifesto. By far the trickiest problem is likely to be the poor state of the UK’s electricity grid infrastructure. It can take a decade just to get a connection to the grid for a new renewable energy facility.', 'The private sector company in charge, National Grid, has promised about £30bn of investment in the UK over the next five years, but that is at the lowest end of what is likely to be needed.

Miliband is known to favour new technology for smaller reactors, but there is no guarantee they will be easier to construct.', 'Carbon capture and storage technology has been talked about for two decades but there is still none operating in the UK at any scale, and some form of the technology is likely to be needed, as a way of keeping a few gas-fired power stations still operating as the UK reaches net zero by 2050. Labour will have to formulate a more coherent plan on this than the Tories managed.', 'Hydrogen is another potential headache for Miliband. The gas could be useful in the greening of some industrial processes, but study after study has found it is infeasible for home heating, for safety, cost and practical reasons to do with how hydrogen behaves as a highly flammable gas. Yet home heating is exactly where its supporters, including the gas industry and unions with members working in it, want it – mainly because they believe hydrogen could run through the existing gas grid and modified boilers.

Two-thirds of its members are expected to meet or exceed that target this year, up from just six countries in 2021.', 'Defense officials have praised these efforts as necessary for security.

But you might be surprised to hear just how many forests are being felled to make it', 'You might think that wearing a top made from wood pulp would give instant eco-credentials – it is renewable, biodegradable, and, having once been a tree, it has soaked up some carbon along the way. What’s more, it’s not plastic. This is why many brands are opting for viscose, Lycocell, acetate and modal – soft, silky, semi-synthetic fabrics made from tree-pulp – as an apparently more sustainable option.', 'Except that the chances are that your wood-pulp top may not be so green. “Deforestation continues to be a problem,” says Nicole Rycroft, who founded Canopy, a Vancouver-based NGO, 25 years ago to help protect ancient and endangered forests. The NGO’s initiative CanopyStyle focuses on fashion. “It’s 2024 – surely we are smarter than mowing down 1,000-year-old trees to make T-shirts.”', 'In total, about 300m trees are logged globally each year to make viscose, sustainably or otherwise. These fabrics go by the rather geeky term, “man-made cellulosic fibres”, or MMCFs. Demand for viscose, the third most used fabric in fashion (after polyester and cotton), is expected to double over the next eight years, says Rycroft: “Many brands are looking for a substitute for polyester or virgin cotton, but it’s trading one environmental disaster for another.”', '“Significant amounts” of viscose come from endangered forests in Brazil, Canada and Indonesia, says Rycroft. “We’ve also noted old-growth forests in Australia – koala habitats – disappearing into the viscose supply-chain. And it’s coming from plantations in Indonesia on peatlands that are incredibly high-carbon.”', 'Indeed, one-sixth of the world’s biggest viscose producers are described as “high risk” in CanopyStyle’s latest Hot Button Report, which assesses producers’ risk of deforestation, their adoption of lower-carbon alternatives to virgin wood-pulp, and their chemical management. It is intended as a one-stop shop for CanopyStyle’s 550 fashion brand members – among them H&M, Stella McCartney and Marks & Spencer – so that they can make informed, ethical purchasing decisions.', 'But even with such resources, some producers described in the report as “high risk” still slip through the net, with their fibres making their way on to the high street. But it is not straightforward to connect the dots back to specific fashion brands. Even though some fashion labels now share their supplier lists online, “it’s hard to find the information – even as a fashion professional,” says Jocelyn Whipple, co-founder of the sustainability consultancy The Right Project.', 'There is “complexity around [supplier] ownership systems, with shell companies, links to mills and supply chains that may not be immediately apparent,” adds Rycroft. In March, for instance, Greenpeace released its Deforestation Anonymous report, noting a new wave of Indonesian deforestation by an anonymously owned “shadow company”.', 'Others point the finger at the fashion labels themselves. “The villains are the brands that don’t disclose any information about their supply chain,” says Dr Kate Hobson-Lloyd, fashion ratings manager at the sustainability ratings app Good on You. “That’s not limited to fast-fashion brands – plenty of high-end brands have poor disclosure.” What’s more, Fashion Revolution’s most recent Transparency Index reveals that only 12% of 250 of the world’s largest fashion brands have published a time-bound, measurable commitment to zero deforestation (among them Burberry, Gucci, John Lewis and Zara), down 3% from the year before.', 'This lack of transparency, traceability and accountability has happened because “voluntary measures only get you so far, and it hasn’t been mandated by regulations yet”, says Shruti Singh, head of Fashion Revolution India. Many brands “will just wait for legislation before mapping their supply chains.”', '“Commitments are never enough,” states a recent report on deforestation by Global Canopy, an environmental not-for-profit (unrelated to Canopy). “They are not worth the paper they are written on unless they are acted on.” It found that 63% of companies that had set deforestation commitments hadn’t shown “adequate evidence of implementing them”.', 'While the EU’s new Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which will come into force on 30 December, ensures that wood and other commodities driving forest degradation will no longer be sold in the EU, Global Canopy claims that “only 1% of companies are likely on track to be compliant with [it].” Other activists question whether EUDR will go far enough: one anonymous source says that “textiles haven’t been explicitly mentioned.”', '“Many brands are not prioritising this because they think customers don’t know or care about the issue,” says Julia Kozlik of the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), a Swiss NGO that certifies sustainable forestry used by Fendi, APC and Gant. It found that 48% of 5,329 British, Italian, French and Spanish consumers weren’t aware that forest fibres are used in clothing, while 76% said they would be concerned if the sourcing of these fibres had a negative environmental effect. Seventy-eight percent said that brands needed to increase their responsible sourcing of forest fibres.', 'Rycroft remains optimistic, however. “In the last seven years, more than half of global viscose producers have shifted away from high-risk forest-sourcing towards FSC-certified forest fibre and low-carbon next-gen alternatives. Historically we’ve seen dramatic shifts – for example, with the recycled paper industry, which brought on 70m tonnes of capacity within a decade. That’s the pace of transition we need to see in fashion.”', 'Look out for Circulose', 'Formerly known as Renewcell, Circulose is a 100% recycled MMCF made from textile waste – no tree-felling required. Available at H&M, Ganni, Levi’s and Arket. Keep your eye out, too, for Spinnova and Infinited Fiber which are racing to scale up their recycled-textile viscose.', 'Check out Ecovero', 'A next-gen viscose made with wood from controlled or certified wood sources, Ecovero is produced using at least 50% fewer carbon emissions and half the water of conventional viscose, plus a minimum of 20% recycled material. Try Ganni, By Malene Birger and Monsoon.', 'Bookmark CanopyStyle’s fashion partner directory', 'Has your favourite brand committed to sourcing viscose without plundering ancient and endangered forests? All of CanopyStyle’s 550 fashion members are held to this standard, as well as to increasing their use of MMCFs made with recycled fibres.', 'Choose FSC certification', 'With Forestry Stewardship Council-certified viscose, you can be confident its production has avoided deforestation, supported biodiversity and protected Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Sezane, Dancing Leopard, Step One, and Ba&sh all use FSC-certified viscose.', 'Go 100% viscose', 'Try to buy viscose in its pure state – it means that it will biodegrade at its end of life, and is easier to recycle if it hasn’t been blended with plastic.', 'This article was amended on 3 July 2024.

Clark saw the imminent risk of unplanned chaos, which would result in the local economy and rich Shetland culture being overwhelmed.', 'Backed by some highly astute councillors, he decided that Shetland would need to acquire special powers from parliament to give the local authority control over developments and impose a levy on every barrel of oil coming ashore. To the fury of the oil industry, Clark was determined to push the extent of these powers to the limit and effectively veto onshore developments until they were secured.', 'While private legislation promoted by local authorities was not unusual, the powers sought by Shetland over the oil industry were exceptional. Critically, these included compulsory purchase of all relevant land and allowing the council to act as port authority and thereby concentrate oil coming ashore at a single, multi-user terminal at Sullom Voe.', 'This brought Clark into direct conflict with oil companies and speculators, backed by Edinburgh and London finance, who were already buying up land at highly inflated prices in key coastal locations. The approach also cut across local vested interests, and a bitter battle ensued with Clark and his allies steadfastly pursuing the legislative route to securing powers.', 'In March 1973, the ways and means committee of the House of Commons decided that the Shetland bill raised issues of such importance that it would have to go through a full parliamentary process. This put it into the hands of Jo Grimond, a former Liberal party leader who represented the constituency.', 'Grimond opened the second reading debate by saying that the bill “may well point the way to better methods of controlling developments consequent upon oil discoveries in other parts of Britain”. As far as Shetland was concerned, “the impact of oil on a rather unique island community will not go on for ever and may be over after 50 years … We must not sacrifice the long-term future of the community.”', 'By this time, Edward Heath’s Conservative government was desperate for infrastructure to be in place that would allow the first North Sea oil, from the Brent field, to flow. While it did not like Clark’s approach or the precedent that significant revenues would go direct to a local authority, it did nothing to stop the bill from becoming law in the spring of 1974, thus clearing the way for the construction of the Sullom Voe terminal.', 'Emphasis during the bill’s passage was more on planning powers than revenues. Shell had seriously understated the Brent reserves and only as the truth emerged about the volumes of oil that would flow through Sullom Voe did the extent of Shetland’s ongoing financial benefits become apparent.', 'The act had given Shetland powers to invest as well as spend. To this day, the funds hold around half a billion pounds, while vast sums have been committed to infrastructure and amenities over the past half century.', 'Grimond’s hope that Shetland would act as a model for the rest of Britain was not fulfilled. The incoming Labour government saw the attractions of the Shetland model, and when the British National Oil Corporation was set up in 1975 Clark left Shetland to become a full-time director with responsibility for setting up the headquarters in Glasgow, from where BNOC set about taking stakes in North Sea developments and investing overseas.', 'However, one of Margaret Thatcher’s first declared intentions after becoming Tory leader was to privatise BNOC and, fatefully, to deprive the UK of a state oil company. The process of dismantling it began with the part-privatisation in 1982 of the exploration and production wing, which was renamed Britoil and of which Clark became joint managing director. He retained this post until the whole lot was sold to BP in 1988.', 'Clark was educated at Dalziel high school in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, the son of Alexander and Annie (nee Watson). He trained in accountancy before entering local government and was recruited to Shetland in the mid-60s as treasurer for what was then Zetland county council. With local government reorganisation in the early 70s, he became chief executive of Shetland Islands council.', 'After the demise of Britoil, Clark was much in demand for board positions with Scottish companies. Moving to live in Campbeltown, Argyll, in later life, he also had time to develop his lifelong interest in theology and in 2010 gained a PhD from the University of Wales Trinity Saint David.

But the real fireworks came with a band who have taken things to another level', 'Friday morning at Glastonbury underlines that the old cliche about the festival having something for everybody is only a cliche because it’s true. Your options range from the beatific (Sofia Kourtesis’s lambent brand of techno) to the profoundly challenging (artist Bishi Bhattacharya performing Yoko Ono’s Voice Piece for Soprano, which sounds every bit as nerve-shredding as you might expect). From the dependable – a sharp-suited Squeeze on the Pyramid stage, offering up one of the late 70s most beloved run of hits – to a largely unknown quantity. Now 80, Asha Puthli last performed in Britain in 1974: her oeuvre takes in everything from collaborations with Ornette Coleman to Bollywood soundtracks to new wave. A tiny figure swathed in chiffon, she turns out to be as spacey and idiosyncratic as the album on which her cult status is based, 1976’s The Devil Is Loose, highly prized by disco collectors and hip-hop producers in search of samples. Between songs, she reminisces about her friendship with legendary drag queen and Warhol superstar Holly Woodlawn, complains about the weather (“it’s bloody fucking cold here – I just flew in from Miami”), and demonstrates how she achieved a curious bubbling sound that appeared on her 1973 cover of George Harrison’s I Dig Love: not, as was commonly supposed, by smoking a bong, but by gargling. Her voice is still capable of summoning up the eerie falsetto that punctuated her underground disco classic Flying Fish, while The Devil Is Loose’s acknowledged classic, Space Talk, still sounds incredible: a seductive, trippy dancefloor shimmer.', 'After UK drill rapper Headie One uses his 18-song set on the Other stage to unveil his new album – no fan of understatement, he incentivises fans to download it by informing them it is “a masterpiece” – the Pyramid stage plays host to the first-ever Glastonbury appearance by a K-pop band, the almost unreasonably pretty Seventeen, whose name is linked to the number of members and subgroups in the band and whose last EP, FML, was the biggest-selling in the world last year. The crowd they draw isn’t vast but at least some of it is very vociferous indeed: the stage-side screens unfortunately pick out a middle-aged onlooker wearing an expression for which the adjective “nonplussed” might have been invented, but equally, there are teenage girls down at the front expressing their appreciation by making a noise not dissimilar to Yoko Ono’s Voice Piece for Soprano. And Seventeen, whose music varies from toothsome pop that comes accompanied by film of cartoon unicorns to what sounds like a peculiarly fresh-faced take on nu-metal, work very hard indeed to win over the merely curious. The hook of their closing track Very Nice is difficult to dislodge from your brain for the remainder of the day, simply because they repeat it so many times: every time you think they’re about to leave the stage, they start singing it again.', 'You can understand why performance artist Marina Abramović told the Guardian she was “terrified” by the prospect of leading the Pyramid stage audience in what she described as a “collaboration” called Seven Minutes of Collective Silence – there’s absolutely no guarantee that people will keep quiet for that long, symbolic protest against the horrors of war and violence or not – but it turns out to work: the hush that descends feels powerful and moving, and weirdly makes the artist a hard act to follow.', 'Her successor, PJ Harvey, seems to slip onstage almost unnoticed, and her opening songs fit the mood, alternately hushed and austere: a trio of tracks from last year’s I Inside The Old Year Dying, three more from her eerie, haunted 2011 masterpiece, Let England Shake. Not everything she plays is so subdued – there is a churning take on 50ft Queenie and a version of Dress strafed with cacophonous violin – but there is a captivating sense of cool control to her performance. That’s amplified by the fact that Harvey is a simultaneously compelling and mysterious presence. At one juncture she sits at a lectern, writing in a notebook and sniffing some herbs while her band play on around her. She boldly ends her set with a slow, brooding To Bring You My Love.', 'At the other extreme, LCD Soundsystem offer a kinetic, party-starting burst of hits – All My Friends, Dance Yrself Clean, an extended version of Losing My Edge that interpolates snatches of tracks by artists the lyrics reference, among them Daft Punk and Yazoo. Their mesh of analogue synth, distorted guitar and dancefloor-facing rhythms sounds fantastic.', 'According to the most intriguing bit of her between-song chat, Dua Lipa’s headlining Glastonbury slot came about as a result of an act of childhood manifesting. Whether you buy that or not, she has clearly spent a lot of time carefully studying and absorbing how a successful Glastonbury headline set works, and putting what she has gleaned to good use. She throws everything she has at it to create a sense of special occasion. There are pyrotechnics, special guest appearances – Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker, performing his biggest hit, The Less I Know the Better – and a setlist that smartly tucks a couple of less impressive songs from her coolly received latest album, Radical Optimism, in among a torrent of crowd-pleasing hits: Levitating, Physical, Illusion. It works. The crowd she draws is huge and, moreover, they stay put. There’s none of the wastage that signals a Glastonbury headliner getting it wrong, and driving their audience towards the festival’s other manifold delights.', 'As Kneecap themselves note, 11.30 on a Saturday morning is a peculiar time to be confronted by a political Northern Irish rap duo who have a song called All Your Sniffer Dogs Are Shite. “Fucking hell, what are you all doing here?” ponders MC Mo Chara as he surveys the audience spilling out of the side of the Woodsies tent. Equally, you get why people have made the effort: Kneecap’s depiction of life in west Belfast is alternately funny and aggressively confrontational, it is married to a hugely appealing take on golden age hip-hop and the end result is thrillingly unique.', 'Less surprising is the scale of the audience at the Other stage for the Last Dinner Party: they seem to have sidestepped accusations of hype to become the breakthrough British alt-rock band of 2024. It is fairly obvious why things have worked out for them. There is definitely a hint of contrivance about the whole enterprise, but Abigail Morris is a genuinely charismatic frontwoman; their rampage-through-the-dressing-up-box image leaves them looking fantastic, a riot of bustiers, empire-line frocks and leg-of-mutton sleeves, a striking alternative to a world of “relatable” pop stars and drearily prosaic alt-rock bands with songs that are uniformly great. Unexpectedly preceded by an impassioned speech from Morris urging the audience to become politically active, their closer, Nothing Matters, provokes a euphoric mass singalong.', 'The afternoon passes in a sunny blur. Cyndi Lauper’s She Bop is clearly not the only song in pop history about masturbation, but it is probably the only song in pop history about masturbation that features its singer performing a solo on that school music lesson staple, the recorder. Whatever you make of Keane’s music, there is something sweetly charming about their delight at the unexpected second wind given their career by the TikTok popularity of Somewhere Only We Know. Michael Kiwanuka is flatly brilliant. His music occupies a space that feels uniquely his, informed by the past but never cravenly retro, bordered on various sides by soul, funk, confessional singer-songwriting and blazing psychedelic rock.', 'There is something impressively confident about Little Simz’s approach to her slot on the Pyramid stage. She performs the opening trio of songs alone, boldly relying only on her charisma and skill as an MC and a sound that cranks the bass up to such a degree you can see the screens at the side of the stage shaking. It’s a risk, but it pays off: she cuts a genuinely compelling figure, the music shifts from the downtempo introspection of Introvert to a ferocious version of Venom to the more pop-facing Selfish, and the audience understandably appear completely captivated.', 'It makes for an intriguing contrast with Coldplay, who have now headlined Glastonbury five times, and, since their last appearance in 2016, have completed a 180-degree turn from earnest stadium balladeers to purveyors of relentless more-is-more visual overload. It’s not so much a performance as a constant bombardment of triple-tested hits – Yellow, Clocks, Adventure of a Lifetime, The Scientist, Paradise, Viva La Vida, Higher Power – and spectacle. There are fireworks, confetti cannon, a drone flying overhead broadcasting the vastness of the assembled masses back to them, the illuminated wristbands that turn even the fringes of the crowd into part of the performance. Then there’s the lavishness with which Chris Martin flatters both his audience and the festival itself, a succession of guests that manages to encompass both Afrobeat legend Femi Kuti and Michael J Fox. It is so wilfully over the top that it leaves Dua Lipa’s show looking like an understatement, but, in the middle of the crowd, it would take a quite extraordinary level of churlishness not to be swept along in its wake. Whatever objections you might reasonably lodge against Coldplay melt away in the face of such cartoonish good fun. During an orchestrated mass singalong to Fix You, the cameras briefly focus on drummer Will Champion, who appears to be in tears. But even if it doesn’t leave you moist-eyed, Coldplay’s performance seems like the kind of headlining set that no one present is likely to forget in a hurry, which was clearly the intention. Job done.', 'Given the amount of pop-country currently occupying the singles chart, it feels oddly timely that Shania Twain – whose steroidal brand of pop-country broke big, as she reminds us, 27 years ago – is in the legends slot. The crowd is enormous: if there’s a crippling global shortage of pink cowboy hats, it’s pretty obvious where the finger should be pointed. It’s an experience the 58-year-old singer seems to find both delightfully overwhelming – she launches into a peculiar story about travelling around the festival, peering into portaloos which is either a little fanciful or evidence that Shania Twain has terrible judgment – and faintly disturbing. “What is that?” she shrieks, peering into the crowd: in fairness, a reasonable reaction to being confronted by a large group of people wearing masks featuring your own face. You could, if you wish, bemoan the passing of the era when the legends slot at Glastonbury meant James Brown or Al Green rather than Man! I Feel Like a Woman!, but your argument would find few takers while that song is actually playing. And, as always, there is an alternative: it’s a short walk to the Park stage, where Tuareg guitarist Mdou Moctar is on explosive form, unleashing a series of jagged but dextrous solos, despairingly comparing England’s idea of warm weather to what he’s used to back home in Niger, and – as on his recent album Funeral for Justice – giving the distinct impression that he and his backing musicians are currently one of the greatest rock bands in the world.', 'If Shania Twain’s appearance at Glastonbury seems timely, then so too does Avril Lavigne’s. Punk-pop is currently big business again, and no one did more to turn punk into pop than Lavigne in the early 00s. Moreover, the genre’s current practitioners are happy to pay tribute to her as a forebear: two years ago, on the same stage, Oliva Rodrigo was to be seen performing a cover of Lavigne’s Complicated. And the impact she had on a tweenage audience 20 years ago is obvious: the Other Stage is so over-subscribed that stewards shut down one entrance, the place is packed with early thirtysomething women aloft on people’s shoulders, not merely singing along, but cathartically emoting like mad to Losing Grip and I’m With You: the moment when Lavigne organises a crowd singalong to the latter seems a little surplus to requirements, given that everyone in the field already seems to bellowing along to every word she sings anyway. Critically mocked as cosplay punk and rounded-edge grunge her music may have been, but a song like Don’t Tell Me, which advised her fans not to feel pressurised into having sex, clearly spoke very directly to a generation of women only a few years younger than Lavigne herself when her debut album was released. The songs sound remarkably robust; the field remains packed and devoted to the end.', 'Towards the end of her set, SZA informs the audience that she was “so nervous to be here”. You can understand why. Judging by the fans who assembled at her O2 Arena gig last year, her core audience are teenage girls, not Glastonbury’s main demographic: if you believed what you read on social media following the announcement of her headlining slot, a significant proportion of Glastonbury goers had simply never heard of her. The audience is noticeably thinner than those that gathered for Dua Lipa and Coldplay, but they’re touchingly committed, and their ardour is entirely understandable. As R&B divas go, she’s impressively eclectic and strikingly eccentric. Her sound hops divertingly around: heavy guitars underpin F2F, Love Galore carries a distinct trace of G-funk in its DNA, Nobody Gets Me is an acoustic ballad with a chorus that keeps threatening to break into Natalie Imbruglia’s Torn, the live version of her collaboration with Doja Cat, Kiss Me More, comes interpolated with snatches of Prince’s Kiss.', 'She variously performs astride a giant beetle, accompanied by a hybrid robot/chair – she parts its legs to give it a brief lapdance – waving swords around, and ascending a giant felled tree trunk while clad in a pair of fairy wings (on the way back down, she pauses momentarily to twerk). The connection between the swords and the title of her biggest hit, Kill Bill, aside, what any of this is supposed to signify remains fairly enigmatic, but it would be extremely hard to feel bored while watching someone twerking in fairy wings halfway up a tree.', 'It concludes with her performing 20something, during which she causes a degree of screamy bedlam by descending to the barrier at the front of the stage. This being Glastonbury, a degree of weirdness is added by the fact that one of the fans she’s singing her heartfelt ballad of lost love and post-teenage ennui to is holding an effigy of Milhouse from The Simpsons on a stick: a suitably peculiar ending to a risky, but ultimately hugely rewarding performance – and indeed Glastonbury festival as a whole.', 'This article was amended on 1 and 2 July 2024. An earlier version said Kneecap were from east Belfast rather than west Belfast. It was an effigy of Milhouse from The Simpsons that a fan was holding, not Smithers. And the name of the K-pop band Seventeen comes not from “the number of members in the band”, but from adding these members (13) to the number of subgroups they form (3) and to the band as a whole (1).']",['Alexis Petridis'],,"[['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a7b4a5887b904e0862d427b35719f7a50049b99/289_47_5490_3294/master/5490.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'Chris Martin of Coldplay on the Pyramid stage on Saturday night'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71b9c9a86621c3b2bb8239e20b34e3e673e57f9d/0_1932_4098_3995/master/4098.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Seventeen pictured backstage in an exclusive by the Guardian photographer David Levene.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5977f3ee1d6756b781d23a99d5ba245bd0e2f46/0_119_4380_2628/master/4380.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'PJ Harvey on the Pyramid stage'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0938b355820ffd9f76b9473ee4f641c38e09f493/0_1818_4098_2458/master/4098.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Dua Lipa on Friday night at Glastonbury 2024'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e086ab5f7909fc59368f3638587d3765769a51c/1295_329_2146_2146/master/2146.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'DJ Próvaí of Kneecap'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eef2a90ad21c78200da7a85cff89ea1bdbcda296/494_654_5506_3303/master/5506.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Cyndi Lauper'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ab80a15f2cc95978cb2e2aac8871ce1d0aab3b1/0_109_5878_3526/master/5878.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'The full spectacle of Coldplay’s performance on Saturday night'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be51436adc15675ada2aebe82bdee197a86c02d7/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'Remarkably robust songs … Avril Lavigne.'], ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/beae8fc851a49d5a1e70c8d08670bb58a43f4845/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none', 'SZA performing on the Pyramid stage.']]",
