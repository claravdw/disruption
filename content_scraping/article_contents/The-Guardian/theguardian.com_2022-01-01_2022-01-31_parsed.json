The police, crime, sentencing and courts bill for England and Wales being debated in parliament provides the police with a dramatic extension to their powers to stop or constrain protest. It even contains a provision allowing police to fine protesters for inadvertent breaches of restrictions they \u201cought\u201d to have known about.\\nIt\u2019s remarkable that the government would frame people campaigning about the climate crisis, rather than the climate crisis itself, as the priority problem. But Patel is following a line of thought going back to the dawn of industrialisation, which sees protest crowds as a source of fear. Assembling into crowds gives people power, and allows them to challenge forms of social control.\\nFor those accustomed to holding the whip hand, there is nothing more terrifying than that.\\nThese fears and fantasies about the crowd were systematised into theories that hold crowd members to be inherently violent, and thus view any crowd event as having the potential to descend into mayhem. This then legitimated repression. One can\u2019t reason with the mob, only dominate them.\\nThe irony is that the repressive power of the police, supposedly the means of stopping violence, is actually the source of most violence in crowd events \u2013 either directly (the police inflict far more violence than is inflicted upon them) or indirectly (the repression of protesters\u2019 rights inflames previously peaceable crowds).\\nIn recent years these dynamics of repression and escalation have been increasingly recognised not just by critics but by the police themselves. In the UK, the turning point was the death of Ian Tomlinson during the 2009 G20 summit protests. This led to a major report, Adapting to Protest, which suggested new forms of public order policing, based on new policing practices.\\nOne is facilitation, which entails changing the focus from stopping the crowd, to helping them achieve lawful goals. Another is dialogue policing, where police liaison officers act as mediators between police and the crowd.\\nRecently there has also been emphasis on rights-based policing, which is organised around upholding the right to freedom of peaceful assembly as enshrined in article 11 of the European convention on human rights and article 21 of the international covenant on civil and political rights.\\nThe recent Cop26 in Glasgow was heralded by Police Scotland as an event where the principles of rights-based policing would be put into practice. Our team of psychologists, sociologists and legal scholars spent two weeks on the streets of the city examining how that worked out.\\nCertainly there was a lot of protest \u2013 a 100,000-strong march was the centrepiece, but marches, vigils, sit-downs and lock-ons occurred every day. And yet there was virtually no violence, and fewer than 100 arrests in total.\\nMuch of this has been put down to \u201cfirm but amiable policing\u201d. But protesters had no intention to be violent in the first place, even Priti Patel\u2019s bugbears in Extinction Rebellion (XR). This was exemplified for me personally when XR mounted an action outside a Santander bank branch. Two people locked themselves together and blocked the street. Protesters assembled, chanted, danced and painted graffiti on the walls of the bank.\\nTwo hours later it was all over, everyone had left and council cleaners had even removed the graffiti. \u201cWas it hard work?\u201d I asked the cleaners. \u201cNo,\u201d they replied. \u201cEasy, it was chalk-based paint [designed to wipe off with a cloth].\u201d XR protesters may be awkward and they may be disruptive. But they are certainly not violent or destructive.\\nThe only times we saw mounting tension and anger were where protesters did experience the policing as excessive and intrusive \u2013 as when police gathered in large numbers, and used surveillance officers to film protesters \u2013 or repressive, notably during two kettling incidents.\\nThis came down to differences in the sense of threat or danger. While the police committed in principle to enabling peaceful protest, disruptive crowd actions were always seen to compromise official control and hence create danger, and therefore had to be policed robustly. For protesters, however, danger was not on the horizon and hence the policing was seen as excessive.\\nFor example, the kettling incident on 3 November occurred when a protester outside the offices of the SSE energy company was said by police to have sprayed two officers with paint. The police characterised this as an assault on their officers and as evidence of the threat posed by the crowd. Protesters saw it as nothing of the sort, and certainly not a reason to treat their protests as threatening.\\nOverall, Cop26 represented an uneasy grafting of rights-based policing concerns on to prior concerns about control. While the low level of arrests seems encouraging, if it comes out of an overall massive use of force that makes protesters feel unable to exercise their rights to peaceful protest it\u2019s hardly something to celebrate.\\nThe way forward is to understand that a rights-based approach cannot simply be mixed into an existing public order framework but must lead to a rethinking of traditional policing priorities.\\nWhich is why the police and crime bill is a step backwards. It delegitimates protest in the eyes of the police, and delegitimates police in the eyes of protesters. It ditches individual rights, and raises restoring control as the overriding consideration.\\nThe bill unambiguously reinstates the police as arbiters rather than facilitators of dissent. It will further erode police legitimacy and give succour to a chant we heard repeatedly on the streets of Glasgow: \u201cWho do you serve? Who do you protect?\u201d\\nStephen Reicher is a member of the Sage subcommittee advising on behavioural science. He is a professor of Psychology at the University of St Andrews.

They all supported Johnson in the 2019 general election, but his conduct in office, and management of Downing Street during the pandemic, has since proved every bit as haphazard as his critics had suggested it might.\\nHere, the Guardian looks at the Sunday newspaper editorials and comment pieces. They mostly reflect surprise, anger and despair \u2013 but none actually call for him to quit.\\nWhere did it all go wrong? The PM should show the voters who gave him a landslide that he is still on their side by scrapping the projected increase in National Insurance as part of a total rethink on tax and spend \u2026 Time was when Mr Johnson identified himself as standing on the side of the consumer, as a liberal-minded and patriotic politician who thought that the Government should largely leave people alone. This has been jettisoned in favour of the nanny state and social-democracy, which is both an economic miscalculation and a political one. Are Extinction Rebellion, Greta Thunberg, anti-car activists, and supporters of big government and higher taxes now queuing up to defend the Prime Minister? Successive Tory governments have bent over backwards to give the Left everything it wants with no electoral payoff whatsoever. Key to political survival is loyalty: remember who put you where you are and why \u2026\\nUnusually, perhaps, the Mail on Sunday did not write an editorial on the prime minister\u2019s woes, preferring to focus on its criticism of the BBC. Two opinion pieces made the case for keeping Johnson.\\nDr Liam Fox, Conservative MP and former defence secretaryThose who hate Johnson because of his role in the referendum campaign, or because they are unwavering in their opposition to the Conservative Party, will never be placated. We should not be swayed by their voices \u2026 Given that the pandemic has become the defining issue of Johnson\u2019s government, we will only know its real agenda in the coming months. We should defer judgment. This is a time for unity over division, hard work over personal ambition and putting the country before the party. It is not a time for a leadership challenge.\\nPeter HitchensHeaven knows I am no supporter or defender of Johnson. Even on his own terms, his behaviour has been dismal. I think he betrayed everything he supposedly stood for when he closed the country that evening nearly two years ago. He listened to the wrong experts and allowed the promotion of a terrible exaggerated fear, which has permanently ruined many lives and which he still has not managed to disperse. But I do wonder why he is now in such trouble, just after he had begun to show signs of regaining his reason.\\nJohnson\u2019s longevity is a more complicated question. On one level it is axiomatic that voters, exercising their will at the ballot box, get the politicians they deserve.\\nWhen you consider that the alternative in 2019 was Jeremy Corbyn, it puts a different light on the old adage. Sir Keir Starmer, for all his improvements to Labour\u2019s front bench, remains some way from looking like the winner of the next election.\\nHoping for Johnson to change is pointless: he won\u2019t. We can only hope that this era of destructive decadence eventually gives way to something brighter. Perhaps, out of the bewildering mess that is Johnson\u2019s premiership, a challenger will at some point emerge who can combine competence with trustworthiness and a little entrepreneurial vision. Is that too much to ask?\\nBoris Johnson\u2019s lack of grip over the Downing Street lockdown parties and their fallout has been staggering. The Prime Minister has admitted joining one bash as voters endured strict restrictions which prevented them seeing dying loved ones.\\nAt another do, a fridge was stocked with booze while the nation prepared to mark the death of Prince Philip. We report today that around 35 Tory MPs have submitted no confidence letters in the PM to the backbench 1922 Committee. That was before they returned to their constituencies this weekend to face the full ire of furious voters. Another 20 or so letters will trigger a disastrous leadership contest that could seal his fate \u2026 Now Boris is pinning his hopes on the Partygate inquiry by civil servant Sue Gray. Even if he is cleared of serious rulebreaking, Boris\u2019s famed ability to wriggle out of scrapes will be tested to the limit. The PM urgently needs to re-establish the trust of the British people if he is to survive.\\nWe hope that Boris Johnson and those around him will now do the right thing for the health of our politics. The surest way to stop the seemingly almost daily toxic deluge of scandals about lockdown-era partying is to ensure that every single incident is fully reported to the senior civil servant Sue Gray as she pursues her forensic investigation. This debacle must not delay urgent work to revitalise the economy, rescue health and social care and make up for lost time in education. And there is also the big challenge of delivering on all the promises of the 2019 election and levelling-up Britain\u2019s poorest communities.

About 1.5kg a week is consumed by the average citizen of the EU27 \u2013 that\u2019s twice the global average.\\nBut it is also clear that if there is to be any hope of reducing the impact of global heating, that consumption level will have to fall rapidly. Greenpeace estimates that it will need to drop by 70% by the end of the decade, and down to 300g by 2050. That translates (since not all the meat that leaves slaughterhouses ends up being either sold or eaten) to each European actually eating, per week, a quantity of meat equivalent to about two good-sized hamburgers.\\nThe response to this news? Unenthusiastic, to say the least. Politically, balancing the priorities of environmental action against the clout of often powerful farming lobbies and the expectations of populations accustomed to consuming large quantities of unrealistically cheap meat looks nearly impossible.\\nIn Spain, for example, which holds the dubious honour of being the EU member state with the highest per capita meat supply in the bloc (more than 100kg per person, per year) the consumer affairs minister, Alberto Garz\u00f3n, was engulfed in a national row last July after calling on his compatriots to eat less meat for the sake of the environment and of their own bodies. \u201cOur health and the health of our families is at stake,\u201d he said. \u201cEating too much meat is bad for our health, and for the planet.\u201d\\nWithin hours, he had been slapped down not just by the agriculture minister, but by the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez. Asked what he made of Garz\u00f3n\u2019s plea, S\u00e1nchez observed: \u201cSpeaking personally, a medium-rare steak is hard to beat.\u201d\\nThere is evidence that many Europeans are taking the issue seriously. One recent survey showed almost half (46%) of European consumers are now eating less meat than they once did, while 40% are planning on reducing their meat consumption in the future.\\nThe EU-backed study, of more than 7,500 people in 10 European countries, found a third actively sought to minimise their meat consumption \u2013 with 73% of that group saying they had \u201csubstantially\u201d reduced their meat intake over the past months.\\nBut in its latest document, the European Commission suggests that despite clear and growing public awareness of the importance of sustainability, EU meat consumption per capita, left to its own devices, is likely to fall by little more than 3kg a year.\\nGovernment intervention, then, will be essential, but, judging by Spain\u2019s example, difficult. Garz\u00f3n again told the Guardian in December that people had to reduce their meat consumption, and contrasted meat from traditional, extensive farming with that produced on intensive megafarms, but parts of Garz\u00f3n\u2019s interview were seized on by the conservative People\u2019s party and the far-right Vox party, who have demanded he resign for what they portray as an unforgivable attack on Spain\u2019s important meat industry and the quality of its exports.\\nThe consumer affairs minister has stuck by his words, accusing \u201cthe lobby of certain big companies which promote polluting megafarms\u201d of deliberately distorting what he said. His comments, moreover, do not differ wildly from official government policy. The ministry for ecological transition wants extensive production systems promoted, and well-adapted native breeds used more. The agriculture minister has praised small family farms, and some regional governments have already acted to limit intensive farming.\\nIn Germany, traditionally among the EU\u2019s biggest consumers of animal-based products per capita, meat-eating has declined steadily over the last two decades, but here too the politics are sensitive.\\nThe Green party, part of the new three-party coalition with the centre-left SPD and the liberal FDP, might have been expected to throw itself into accelerating the falling trend, but has so far held back.\\nThe hesitancy comes from painful political experience. Germany\u2019s Greens have suffered in recent years from being seen as a Verbotspartei, intent on banning the joys of life. A 2013 \u201cveggie day\u201d initiative for meat-free days at state-subsidised canteens saw the tabloid Bild complain that \u201cthe Greens want to take our meat away\u201d.\\nInstead, the environmental party has used its first weeks in power to initiate a less politically exposing campaign against junk meat sold for junk prices. The new agriculture minister, Cem \u00d6zdemir, told Bild Germans were losing out because food quality and food prices were too low.\\nJunk prices, often imposed by all-powerful supermarket chains, he said, \u201cdrive farms to ruin, prevent animal welfare, promote species extinction and burden the climate. I want to change that.\u201d The price of food should, he said, echoing the findings of a commission set up by the previous government, reflect the \u201cecological truth\u201d and consumers must get used to paying a fair price for better quality.\\nBut this approach, too, is far from universally popular: the new government\u2019s attack on cheap meat was criticised by the Parit\u00e4tische Gesamtverband, an umbrella group for Germany\u2019s social welfare organisations, which argues higher food prices must be accompanied by compensation payments for those on low incomes.\\nAnd in Italy, the environment minister, Roberto Cingolani, triggered a fiery debate last year by saying excessive meat consumption was harmful to health and the environment, adding that encouraging Italians to eat less meat would be central to his plans.\\n\u201cChanging our diet will have the combined benefit of improving public health, decreasing water use and producing less CO2,\u201d Cingolani said. Farmers hit back instantly, saying annual meat consumption per capita in Italy is among the lowest in Europe and meat was an important part of a balanced diet.\\nActivists including Luca Mercalli, a well-known metorologist, are keeping the debate alive, arguing that better quality meat produced closer to home and consumed in smaller quantities would make a significant difference to the environment.\\n\u201cA proportion of Italians are sensitive to the topic and have changed their diets, either due to concerns about the climate or dietary motives,\u201d Mercalli said. \u201cThe problem in Italy is the debate often turns toxic, with vegetarians becoming very judgmental of meat-eaters, which in turn alienates 90% of the population.\u201d\\nThe onus should be on the government to provide clearer information, he said. \u201cThe message should be: eat less meat, but when you do, buy locally produced meat that is more sustainable. Even if you pay more, eating better quality meat once a week is far better than eating a cheap hamburger every day.\u201d\\nFrench meat consumption has also been falling steadily, with surveys suggesting half the population has reduced their meat consumption over the past three years and that 30% would like to continue doing so over the next three. And yet howls of outrage greeted the launch of France\u2019s national low-carbon strategy, adopted in 2020, which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture \u2013 which represent 20% of the country\u2019s total, with fully 80% generated by livestock farming \u2013 by 19% by 2030 and 46% by 2050.\\nEU countries that have tried to implement concrete meat reduction policies have faced instant backlashes. The Danish government was forced in 2020 to reverse a ban on state canteens serving meat for two days every week after trade unions and the food industry objected, and the government has now instead switched its focus to boosting non-meat food production, approving a climate agreement that features the EU\u2019s largest investment in plant-based research and development, including an annual fund to support the transition to a nationwide dietary shift. In the Netherlands, in an attempt to prioritise tackling the major environmental issues long caused by its intensive pig and other farms, the new government features a minister for nature and nitrogen affairs, Christianne van der Wal-Zeggelink.\\nAnd all of this is no less true for the European Commission itself, struggling with the incompatibility of ambitious carbon emission reduction plans and the vast common agricultural policy subsidies that account for nearly a third of the EU\u2019s budget. Greenpeace has broken down the numbers and calculates that a fifth of the EU\u2019s entire budget is spent on livestock.\\nAs recently as 2020, the EU was still spending money to promote meat eating with a controversial and frankly slightly mad ad campaign exhorting people to become Beefatarians. \u201cIf the sound of beef sizzling on the grill brings tears to your eyes, you\u2019re a real Beefatarian,\u201d coos the ad.

It has been untouched for two decades, but passing our (nationality and) borders bill into law in 2022 will finally give us the powers we need to deliver long-overdue change.\\n\u201cA fairer system deterring illegal entry across the Channel by cracking down on people smugglers and ending the legal merry-go-round of spurious asylum claims is what the British people expect and we will deliver.\u201d\\nPatel also said the streets were safer thanks to a reduction in knife crime, gun crime and murders.\\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), there was an 8% decrease in knife-enabled crime in the year ending June 2021, compared with the previous year.\\nHomicides were also down 11%, it said, while offences involving firearms fell by 6%. All figures were for crimes recorded by the police in England and Wales.\\nHowever the ONS stressed that patterns of crime over that period had been \u201csignificantly affected\u201d by the Covid pandemic and government instructions to limit social contact.\\nPatel said: \u201cWhether it be cutting crime, keeping our country safe from terrorism or controlling our borders, we have a range of plans in progress to deliver for the British people. That is an ambitious programme, but one I will be relentless in delivering as we focus on building back safer in the year ahead.\u201d\\nAdam Wagner, a human rights barrister at Doughty Street chambers, said the Home Office needed to review its own role in asylum claims rather than place responsibility on lawyers.\\n\u201cThis home secretary, and the government she represents, spend too much time making out that lawyers and legal process are somehow responsible for the broken asylum system,\u201d he said.\\n\u201cThe truth is that almost half of all asylum appeals are successful \u2013 and the reason for that is a poorly resourced Home Office which blames everyone but itself for shoddy decision-making. The asylum system protects the world\u2019s most vulnerable and we should all focus on doing better by them.\u201d\\nA spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion said: \u201cThis is the action of a government who are clinging on to a model of business as usual that is heading us towards disaster and they would rather imprison grandparents, teachers and priests than face the scale of the changes that they need to make.\u201d\\nLabour\u2019s shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said the government had the wrong priorities: \u201cProsecutions have plummeted, recorded violent crime and antisocial behaviour are up, just 1.4% of rapes are going to court and more victims are being let down. Asylum decisions are down, the backlog is going up, dangerous boat crossings are increasing, and safe, legal routes are being cut.\\nCooper said that 95% of Windrush scandal victims have had no compensation as yet and added: \u201cThe Home Office plan for 2022 should be to put right these deep-rooted problems caused by 11 years of Conservative policies.

Conservative MPs variously said the verdict undermined the rule of law and that they were deeply concerned by the precedent it set.\\nFor Mike Schwarz, a partner at Hodge, Jones and Allen and a veteran in representing protesters \u2013 including 28 Greenpeace activists cleared in 2001 of causing criminal damage despite admitting destroying a crop of genetically modified maize \u2013 that reaction was all too familiar.\\n\u201cI remember just after one of the Greenpeace cases, over a decade ago, there was a front page of the old G2 environment section of the Guardian where there was a big picture of a protest and a banner headline posing the question whether the verdict meant a \u2018free for all\u2019 [for direct action protests],\u201d he said.\\n\u201cAnd when I saw the reaction to Colston I had flashbacks to those times. Now, as then, there was a concern \u2013 outrage, even \u2013 from the more reactionary parts of the political spectrum about activists being able to do what they want and juries acquitting them.\u201d\\nHe said governments and businesses never liked juries acquitting protesters who had admitted damage or disruption, but it was not a new phenomenon and had not caused a free for all.\\nEven before the GM crops case, in 1996 a Liverpool jury acquitted two women charged with causing \u00a31.5m damage to a Hawk fighter jet. They admitted the damage but said they had acted to prevent its use in the bombing of East Timor by Indonesia, which contravened international law.\\nSchwartz, who represented six climate crisis activists acquitted last month for a protest that halted the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) in London\u2019s financial district, said the lesson from Colston was that \u201cjuries are the safest pair of hands to deal with issues about the lawful scope of protest and concerns about what government or business do. This is the rule of law in action.\u201d\\nMartin Porter, a coordinator of Greenpeace\u2019s Manchester branch and one of those cleared in the GM crops case, also dismissed the idea of dangerous precedents being set.\\n\u201cIn our case it was a government that was clearly going against public opinion in the way it was allowing GM crops, and in this case Bristol council had not taken any action over community outrage at the statue,\u201d he said.\\n\u201cWe were only asking for acquittal for what we did, not a carte blanche to go and do it anywhere else. In our case the evidence was around the things we\u2019d done beforehand to try and get this crop stopped, and in the Colston case it was the campaigns that had been going on for years to try and get this statue removed.\u201d\\nIan Bray, a co-founder of Extinction Rebellion (XR) who has twice been acquitted by jurors \u2013 once in the DLR trial and once in April last year after damaging Shell\u2019s London headquarters \u2013 said juries understood that \u201cnot all damage is the same\u201d but it also came down to luck.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s like pulling the lever of a fruit machine and you\u2019re hoping for three pineapples,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get at least three jurors who won\u2019t convict. If you\u2019ve only got two, the other 10 are a majority who can convict, but you can\u2019t have a nine-to-three majority.\u201d\\nBray said it was a deliberate tactic of XR to get trials before juries \u2013 there are a string of cases delayed by Covid \u2013 in the hope that they prove more sympathetic than magistrates. To that end, in the action against Shell he said they aimed to cause just over \u00a35,000 damage to meet the threshold for a crown court trial but avoid the risk of heavy sentencing, only to be charged with \u00a325,000 of damage. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to calculate,\u201d said Bray.\\nSchwarz and a fellow HJA partner, Raj Chada, who represented two of the Colston four, believe the defence of protesters has been boosted by a supreme court ruling last year. In June the UK\u2019s highest court quashed the convictions of Nora Ziegler and three others who had formed a blockade outside a London arms fair, saying there must be a test of \u201cproportionality\u201d weighing up the defendants\u2019 rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly against the disruption caused. The defence of proportionality was subsequently used in the DLR and Colston cases.\\nBy contrast, in the Shell case, which was pre-Ziegler, the judge said there was no defence in law. However, the Shell defendants were still acquitted. It illustrates that for all the government talk of closing loopholes to prevent a repeat of the Colston decision, and Boris Johnson and Priti Patel encouraging prosecution of protesters, while there is a right to jury trial \u2013 something the government has itself proposed strengthening in a new bill of rights \u2013 juries will always have the right to acquit where they see fit.\\nKirsty Brimelow QC, the vice-chair of the Criminal Bar Association, said: \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a rebellion. The verdict was within the law. Juries will continue making their decisions on the lives of those placed in their hands on the facts of the cases and within the protection of the law for both defendants and prosecution. The verdict should not be traduced by politics.\\n\u201cTaxpayers may prefer their money to be directed at the causes of the protests: they are big causes such as the climate crisis, the erasure of black history and historic and present atrocities and violence against women and girls.\u201d", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f16a3009e5b1e73447111bc13b721828680db667/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "The toppling of the statue of Edward Colston in June 2020"]], "author": ["Haroon Siddique"], "date": "2022-01-07"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/26/joe-manchin-climate-crisis-global-villain": {"title": "\u2018He\u2019s a villain\u2019: Joe Manchin attracts global anger over climate crisis", "subtitle": null, "text": "The West Virginia senator\u2019s name is reviled on the streets of Bangladesh and other countries facing climate disaster as he blocks Biden\u2019s effort to curb planet-heating gases\\nWithin the brutal machinations of US politics, Joe Manchin has been elevated to a status of supreme decision-maker, the man who could make or break Joe Biden\u2019s presidency.\\nInternationally, however, the Democratic senator\u2019s new fame has been received with puzzlement and growing bitterness, as countries already ravaged by the climate crisis brace themselves for the US \u2013 history\u2019s largest ever emitter of planet-heating gases \u2013 again failing to pass major climate legislation.\\nFor six months, Manchin has refused to support a sweeping bill to lower emissions, stymieing its progress in an evenly split US Senate where Republicans uniformly oppose climate action. Failure to pass the Build Back Better Act risks wounding Biden politically but the ramifications reverberate far beyond Washington, particularly in developing countries increasingly at the mercy of disastrous climate change.\\n\u201cHe\u2019s a villain, he\u2019s a threat to the globe,\u201d said Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development, based in Bangladesh. \u201cIf you talk to the average citizen in Dhaka, they will know who Joe Manchin is. The level of knowledge of American politics here is absolutely amazing, we know about the filibuster and the Senate and so on.\\n\u201cWhat the Americans do or don\u2019t do on climate will impact the world and it\u2019s incredible that this one coal lobbyist is holding things up. It will cause very bad consequences for us in Bangladesh, unfortunately.\u201d\\nThe often tortuous negotiations between Manchin, the White House and Democratic leaders appeared doomed on 19 December when the West Virginia senator said he could not support the $1.75tn bill, citing concerns over inflation and the national debt. The latest twist caused anguish to those who see their futures being decided by a previously obscure politician located thousands of miles away.\\n\u201cI\u2019ve been following the situation closely,\u201d said Tina Stege, climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, a low-lying Pacific nation that risks being wiped out by rising sea levels. \u201cWe have to halve emissions in this decade and can\u2019t do it without strong, immediate action by the US.\u201d\\nStege said the Marshall Islands was already suffering the impacts of the climate crisis and if the US doesn\u2019t slash its emissions \u201cthe outcomes for countries like mine are unthinkable.\u201d\\nEven America\u2019s closest allies have looked on in dismay as a single lawmaker from Biden\u2019s own party has stalled what would be the biggest \u2013 and arguably first \u2013 piece of climate legislation in the US\u2019s plodding, and often rancorous, history of dealing with escalating global heating.\\n\u201cBiden has done a fair bit in very challenging circumstances [but] in Canada we look on with bewilderment because it\u2019s such a different political context. It\u2019s very bizarre,\u201d said Catherine McKenna, who was environment minister in Justin Trudeau\u2019s government that introduced carbon pricing in 2019. \u201cPolitics is hard but I don\u2019t think anyone has given up. We just really hope they are able to get a deal.\u201d\\nMcKenna said she was vilified by some Canadian provincial premiers who \u201cfought to the death\u201d against carbon pricing but that there was now broader support for climate action across the country, including within industry, than in the US. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that it\u2019s just one person that is holding up something that\u2019s so critically important,\u201d she said of Manchin.\\n\u201cJoe Manchin is a problem, and I think he needs to be called out,\u201d said Ed Davey, a British MP who was previously the UK\u2019s secretary of state for energy and climate change. \u201cIt\u2019s in the US interest, in the interest of West Virginia and elsewhere, to take advantage of green zero-carbon technology, which is the future.\u201d\\nDavey, who is now leader of the Liberal Democrats, warned that the US risks ceding leadership in clean energy to China if it doesn\u2019t act. \u201cPeople will end up paying higher prices, jobs will go and not be created, the security of America will be reduced, Beijing will be laughing,\u201d he said, adding that Manchin was in effect \u201cworking on behalf of the Chinese government\u201d by not supporting the transition away from fossil fuels.\\nChina used last year\u2019s Cop26 climate talks in Scotland to \u201cinsidiously point out to every country that US just can\u2019t implement\u201d, said Rachel Kyte, dean of The Fletcher School at Tufts University and a climate adviser to the UN secretary general. Kyte said many governments believe Biden is well-meaning but cannot follow through on his commitments, a frustration compounded by a lack of American action on related areas, such as climate finance for poorer countries.\\n\u201cThere\u2019s almost a resentment that the US just can\u2019t deliver,\u201d she added. \u201cThere\u2019s this sinking feeling about the politics of America. You can\u2019t turn your back on the US because it\u2019s still the biggest economy, but what are countries supposed to do?\u201d\\nMuch of this angst is now being channeled towards Manchin.\\nAfter more than a decade in national politics, the 74-year-old senator has suddenly garnered a level of infamy far beyond his fiefdom of West Virginia, where the centrist Democrat has served as governor and senator while reaping millions of dollars through his personal investments and campaign contributions from a coal industry that continues to loom large in his state. It\u2019s a situation that has caused bafflement overseas.\\n\u201cWho is Manchin, the Dem senator from West Virginia who betrayed Biden?\u201d La Repubblica in Italy has demanded. Clar\u00edn, a newspaper in Argentina, has called Manchin a \u201crebelde\u201d and a \u201ctycoon with ties to the mining structure of West Virginia, the other Virginia of the USA\u201d. Helsingin Sanomat, a Finnish newspaper, also noted Manchin\u2019s links to the fossil fuel industry and lamented that he has \u201cdisagreed with the most ambitious climate action\u201d put forward by the US.\\nThe negotiations with Manchin involve stakes far greater than any normal political maneuvering in Washington. The world is already being strafed by wildfires, heatwaves, floods and societal instability wrought by the climate crisis and rising temperatures are on track to breach limits set by governments in the Paris climate accords, a situation that would push some parts of the world beyond human livability.\\nSalvaging this situation will be virtually impossible without swift action by the US, the world\u2019s second largest carbon polluter and a major oil and gas exporter. Analysts say the half a trillion dollars of support for renewable energy and electric cars in the Build Back Better bill would give the US a decent chance of cutting its emissions in half this decade, which Biden and scientists say is imperative to avoid climate breakdown.\\nBut Manchin\u2019s opposition has already ensured the removal of a key element of the bill, a plan to force utilities to phase in clean energy over time, and the prospect of him joining Republicans to block the overall package has seen him come under intense criticism within the US.\\nClimate activists have confronted Manchin in Washington and kayaked to his yacht to remonstrate with him. Some fellow Democrats say he has \u201cfailed the American people\u201d. Even the Sunday Gazette, the local paper of Charleston, West Virginia, has run a headline of \u2018We need this so bad\u2019, in reference to the bill.\\nAll this has been to little effect, although Manchin did say earlier this month there could still be agreement on \u201cthe climate thing\u201d, offering some vague hope to activists while not quite quelling their anger. \u201cSenator Manchin is a fossil-fueled sociopath on a Maserati joyride while he lets the world burn,\u201d said Janet Redman, climate campaign director at Greenpeace USA. \u201cAt the end of the day, Manchin cares less about his constituents than he does about the fossil fuel industry.\u201d\\nThe current, floundering attempt to pass climate legislation is a grimly familiar episode in a lengthy record of American inadequacy. Donald Trump donned a coal miner\u2019s helmet on the campaign trail and removed the US from the Paris climate deal. Barack Obama failed to get cap-and-trade legislation past a recalcitrant Congress. George W Bush rejected the Kyoto climate accords. In 1993, a previous Democratic senator from West Virginia, Robert Byrd, blocked a Bill Clinton plan to tax carbon emissions.\\nManchin is, in some respects, a \u201cfall guy\u201d for a deeper American political dysfunction over the climate crisis, Kyte said. \u201cIf Republicans weren\u2019t in the lock-grip of certain vested interests, if they had a policy on climate adaptation or green jobs for the future, Joe Manchin wouldn\u2019t have the influence he has,\u201d she said.\\n\u201cJoe Manchin has become the personification of a problem and removing him doesn\u2019t solve it,\u201d Kyte added. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t give us a bipartisan agreement of the danger we are in. A political culture that allows you to enrich yourself and your family from industries you regulate and not declare a conflict of interest lies beyond Joe Manchin, it\u2019s bigger than just him.\u201d\\nEven if American political inertia hasn\u2019t changed, the world certainly has \u2013 the last seven years were the planet\u2019s hottest on record, cataclysmic wildfires are now year-round events in the US west and deadly flooding swamps basements in New York, picturesque towns in Germany and subways in China. There is mounting fear that the world, including the US, does not have the time for yet another futile American effort to address the unraveling climate crisis.\\n\u201cUnfortunately, politicians getting fossil fuel money are standing in the way and sacrificing the rest of us once again,\u201d said Vanessa Nakate, a climate justice activist from Uganda. Nakate pointed out that Africa was suffering from climate change even though it is responsible for just a small fraction of global emissions.\\n\u201cWe are so reliant on the choices others make,\u201d she said. \u201cOur lives are literally in their hands.\u201d\\nThis article was amended on 26 January 2022 to correct Rachel Kyte\u2019s title.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c95ce82a1bfab2b8442a8a399a073f559cc51d77/0_141_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?width=480&dpr=1&s=none", "Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat vital to the fate of President Joe Biden's $3.5 government overhaul, updates reporters about his position on the bill, at the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 30, 2021.

Here are some examples.\\nRoger Hallam, co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, was cleared by a jury in 2019 despite not denying causing criminal damage worth \u00a37,000 when he sprayed the walls of Kings College London, with the words \u201cdivest from oil and gas\u201d in protest against the institution\u2019s fossil fuel investments. Hallam, who was acquitted along with another activist, said it showed \u201cordinary people, unlike the judiciary, are able to see the broader picture\u201d.\\nIn April 2021 six Extinction Rebellion protesters were cleared of causing criminal damage to Shell\u2019s London headquarters despite the judge directing jurors that those on trial had no defence in law. Protesters poured fake oil, glued themselves to windows and doors, broke glass, climbed on to a roof and sprayed graffiti as part of wider demonstrations across the capital. Before reaching their verdicts, the jury had asked to see a copy of the oath they took when they were sworn in. Thanking the jurors, the judge said it had been \u201can unusual case\u201d.\\nSix climate crisis activists whose protest halted the Docklands Light Railway, which serves London\u2019s financial district, were acquitted by a jury in December 2021. Five of the Extinction Rebellion protesters climbed on top of the train with banners that read \u201cBusiness As Usual=Death\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Jail the Canaries\u201d while a sixth glued herself to a train window. They were charged with obstructing trains or carriages on the railway and acknowledged their roles in the protest but successfully argued that their action was a lawful protest against government inaction on the climate crisis.\\nWhile there has been a flurry of cases involving Extinction Rebellion recently, there have been previous examples of acquittals by juries concluding that ostensibly criminal actions were motivated by good intentions. In 2008 six Greenpeace climate change activists were cleared of causing \u00a330,000 of criminal damage at Kingsnorth power station, Kent. The activists admitted trying to shut down the coal-fired station by occupying the smokestack but argued they were legally justified because they were trying to prevent climate change causing greater damage to property around the world. It was the first case in which preventing property damage caused by climate change had been used as part of a \u201clawful excuse\u201d defence in court.\\nIn 2001 Lord Melchett, then executive director of Greenpeace, and 27 other supporters were cleared by a court of causing criminal damage despite admitting destroying a crop of genetically modified maize. The defendants said that they acted to prevent pollen from the maize from polluting neighbouring organic crops and gardens.\\nThere have also been a string of acquittals in cases of sabotage of military equipment. In 2007, two anti-war campaigners, Toby Olditch and Philip Pritchard, who broke into RAF Fairford Gloucestershire, to sabotage US bombers at the outbreak of the Iraq war, were cleared of conspiring to cause criminal damage after they argued the B52s would have been used to commit war crimes in Iraq.\\nIn 2000, two anti-nuclear protesters who entered a dockyard planning to disarm one of Britain\u2019s Trident submarines with an axe were cleared of conspiracy to cause criminal damage.

There are also plans for a new criminal offence of obstructing roads, railways, airports, oil refineries and printing presses, carrying a maximum penalty of 12 months in prison.\\nProtesters who attach themselves to another person or object face a potential 51 weeks in prison, and \u201cserious disruption prevention orders\u201d would allow authorities to ban named individuals \u2013 including those without any convictions \u2013 from participating in demonstrations or even using the internet to encourage others to do so.\\nPolice would have more control over where and when demonstrations took place, and extended stop and search powers would allow officers to target people and vehicles if they suspect they might be carrying anything that could be used in protests. A new offence of damage to memorials or statues could lead to up to 10 years in prison.\\nCritics have described the bill as an unprecedented power grab by the state, which would make many forms of protest difficult or impossible. In policy papers, the government is explicit that the new measures are a response to Extinction Rebellion\u2019s hugely disruptive protest campaigns in London in 2019, as well as Black Lives Matter protests the following year. Late-stage amendments tabled by the government in November were widely understood to be intended as a legal crackdown on Insulate Britain\u2019s actions.\\nThe home secretary, Priti Patel, has insisted peaceful protest remains a \u201ccornerstone of democracy,\u201d but argues there has been a \u201csignificant change in protest tactics \u2026 with protesters exploiting gaps in the law which have led to disproportionate amounts of disruption\u201d. The Home Office says the new measures will help plug those gaps allowing police to deal more effectively with demonstrators set on causing serious disruption and inconvenience to the public.\\nAs well as protest and civil liberty groups, 350 charities have signed a letter and more than 800,000 people have signed a petition calling for the bill to be scrapped. In addition 700 academics have come out against the proposals and parliament\u2019s joint committee on human rights said the proposals are \u201coppressive and wrong\u201d.\\nTwo former home secretaries have also criticised the plans with David Blunkett saying the measures risks making the UK \u201cmore like Putin\u2019s Russia\u201d, and would \u201cleave a bad taste in the mouths of British people who value tolerance, democracy and open debate\u201d.\\nIn short, yes. Critics say among the issues of most concern are new powers of stop and search that are likely to hit minority communities hardest, and the provision that turns trespass from a civil into a criminal offence, will allow police to arrest people who are Gypsies, Roma and Travellers and confiscate their homes, if they stop in places that have not been designated for them.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/077f8e7db74a63ad3a0d024e76719206ad8925cb/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "Insulate Britain activists protest in London"]], "author": ["Matthew Taylor"], "date": "2022-01-13"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/06/colston-four-acquittal-raises-doubts-about-10-year-jail-term-proposal": {"title": "Colston Four acquittal raises doubts about 10-year jail term proposal", "subtitle": null, "text": "Legal experts say new law would mean all cases about monument damage go before juries\\nThe acquittal of the Colston Four raises questions about new laws imposing 10-year jail terms for the toppling of statues, legal experts have said.\\nOn Wednesday, three men and a woman who helped pull down a monument to the slave trader Edward Colston at a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest were found not guilty by a jury after they successfully argued they had a lawful excuse.\\nAfter the verdicts, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, was one of several MPs who condemned \u201cdestroying public property\u201d. He said powers in the new police, crime, sentencing and courts bill would close a \u201cpotential loophole\u201d that limits the prosecution of people who damage memorials.\\nThe bill, which is currently going through parliament, would let courts consider the \u201cemotional or wider distress\u201d and increase the maximum sentence to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment regardless of the cost of damage.\\nSome experts, however, said such prosecutions, when heard in front of jurors at crown court, could be destined to fail.\\nProf Tom Lewis, the director of the Centre for Rights and Justice at Nottingham Trent University, said the bill \u201cwill make the trial of those accused of damage to monuments possible only in the crown court, before a jury\u201d.\\nHe said: \u201cThere is a certain irony in the fact that if the [Colston] defendants had been tried before a magistrate, they may well have been convicted. But in electing to trial by their peers \u2013 a right rooted in Magna Carta itself \u2013 they secured an acquittal.\u201d\\nThe verdict in Bristol, where the statue had stood, sent a \u201cpowerful signal\u201d to Boris Johnson and the home secretary, Priti Patel, who had condemned the toppling of Colston and were ushering through the bill, Lewis said.\\nAdam Wagner, a human rights barrister at Doughty Street Chambers, said the verdict was a warning to ministers that the bill would lead to exactly the kinds of outcomes they did not want.\\n\u201cThe current policing bill is criminalising peaceful protest,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to end up happening is that you are going to have more and more juries acquitting on the basis that they just don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to send someone to prison or give them a criminal record for peaceful protesting, and you\u2019ll have more evidence in these trials of political motives.\u201d\\nBut not all lawyers agreed. Zehrah Hasan, a barrister at Garden Court Law and a campaigner with the Black Protest Legal Support, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think we can use this victory as a way to say the courtroom and the law will always make it fair or lead to a just outcome \u2026 when obviously there is evidence of discrimination within the jury system, particularly against black and brown people.\u201d\\nAt a press conference after the verdict, Raj Chada, who represented two of the Colston Four and has also acted for Extinction Rebellion activists, insisted the verdict did not set a precedent and did not mean people could take the law into their own hands.\\n\u201c[The defendants] had a number of defences, but broadly they have a lawful excuse as to why they committed the acts that they did,\u201d Chada said.\\n\u201cThose valid excuses included their right to free speech, their right to conscience, and that a conviction would be disproportionate interference with those rights. And that they were preventing a crime \u2013 it was a criminal offence to keep that statue up because it was so offensive. It is really beyond belief it was up for so long.\u201d\\nThe prime minister said people should not \u201cgo around seeking retrospectively to change our history\u201d, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s like some person trying to edit their Wikipedia entry - it\u2019s wrong.\u201d\\nRobert Buckland, the Tory MP and former justice secretary, told the BBC he thought the jury\u2019s decision was perverse. \u201cI think anybody watching those scenes cannot fail to be disturbed at the very least, and appalled by what happened,\u201d Buckland said.\\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we want to see our crown courts becoming political playgrounds \u2013 they\u2019re not places for politics, they\u2019re places for the law to be applied and for the evidence to be assessed.\u201d\\nJake Skuse, Rhian Graham, Milo Ponsford and Sage Willoughby were cleared after arguing their actions were justified by the offence caused by the presence of the statue in Bristol, the south-west\u2019s most multicultural city.", "image": [["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abede6caaa5aa5fada736289cbb740c06f1e960b/0_618_6285_3773/master/6285.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none", "A sign saying \u201cRespect to the Colston topplers\u201d lies at the base of the plinth where the statue of Edward Colston stood before it was removed by protesters."]], "author": ["Damien Gayle"], "date": "2022-01-06"}}
